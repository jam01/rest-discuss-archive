What\n&gt;\n&gt; Because, as somebody rightly replied to me the other day, humans have\n&gt; &quot;intuition&quot; and computers do not, despite all Artificial Intelligence \n&gt; research\n&gt; for the last 50 years.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, all the analogues of &quot;human readable web&quot; to &quot;machine readable \n&gt; web&quot; are\n&gt; at least a bit shaky ... if we want anything computers to do \n&gt; automatically,\n&gt; there is (still) a need for standards.\n&gt;\n&gt; RDF and ontologies are just one part of the game, they doesn&#39;t cover \n&gt; all the\n&gt; way we humans reason. But they could help with standardizing, the web,\n&gt; hopefully.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nina\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are the cues human users of the web follow to understand the html page\n&gt; &gt; rendered to them? I was wondering if such might be applied to work\n&gt; &gt; similarly to computers. I&#39;ve been reading some works on the semantic\n&gt; &gt; web (RDFs and such) and the topics it touches that overlaps with the\n&gt; &gt; REST discussion. I was wondering though if this would help in building\n&gt; &gt; the generic REST client.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My concern however is if we use RDFs couple this with ontologies,\n&gt; &gt; there might be too much complexity already. On the other hand, is\n&gt; &gt; there a &#39;smart&#39; way for a generic REST client to figure out the\n&gt; &gt; meanings of the hypermedia without explicit specifications? People\n&gt; &gt; seem to do just fine when visiting a site and typing in, say, their\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Birthday&#39;, knowing what that means without really needing having to\n&gt; &gt; read the specs of the site and conforming strictly to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jan Vincent Liwanag\n&gt; &gt; jvliwanag@... &lt;mailto:jvliwanag%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Oct 10, 2009, at 9:22 AM, mike amundsen wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, the two biggest hurdles to a generic HTTP client are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - media types\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - link relations\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Media-types includes not just data format issues (are you using a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known format or a custom XML format?) but also the semantics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the format (which elements are inputs, which are elements\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to query for data, what actions are supported, what data format is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to send data, etc.). Link relations includes which relations are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supported for links, understanding custom rel values, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only data format that works even mildly well in this space is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HTML; and there is a reliable (but rather limited) client for it,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too&lt;g&gt;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OPTIONS seems quite inadequate for this information, so run-time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discovery is pretty weak. That means reliance on out-of-band\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information and &quot;design-time&quot; discovery.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That leads to, IMO, some interesting questions:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - what would it take build a &quot;better browser&quot;; one that supports PUT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and DELETE, understands a wider range of link relations?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - what would it take to establish rendering engines for ATOM and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known, validate-able media types?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - what would it take to establish reliable rendering engines for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constrained media-types (XML, JSON)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - what would it take to establish a standardized documentation that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; includes meda-type details such as sematics, schema, link relations,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - what would it take to improve the OPTIONS method in order to be able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to include (or point to) these standardized documents?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All fertile ground for study, IMO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mca\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/ &lt;http://amundsen.com/blog/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Oct 9, 2009 at 19:44, Josh Sled &lt;jsled@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jsled%40asynchronous.org&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jan Vincent &lt;jvliwanag@... &lt;mailto:jvliwanag%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; \n&gt; writes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I know one may simply use some HTTP client and work\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from there.
