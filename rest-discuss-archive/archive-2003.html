The TC will also define an XML schema to associate metadata with
resources and a service to manipulate this metadata and data associated
with the resources. Specifically, this service will reflect the simple
transactional nature of the WWW, i.e., it will use a small set of REST
(Representational State Transfer) or CRUD-like operators on an
infinitely extensible set of XRI-addressable resources.  This data
exchange service will provide a platform for integration with
directory-related specifications such as LDAP, DSML, and SPML.

<pre>Yah, I've talked with Gabe Wachod about this, who's gone out of his way
to be accomodating of my views.  He may be fuzzy on the technical side,

REST reference.

I think we can safely ignore this group.  It seems like they exist to
rubber stamp XNS, which IMO doesn't stand a chance of getting deployed.

Subject:ReST and Representing Mailboxes<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I am trying to figure out how to create a ReST
interface to a mailfolder.

Initially, I figured I could simply POST messages
and have them appended to the mailfolder and then
GET with range-headers to see if anyone has added
anything new since the last time I checked the
folder.

The problem I have is that I want to permit the
server to move attachments to other URIs,
modifying the messages in accord with RFC2017 to
have:

content-type: message/external-body; access-type=URL;
	url="http://location/of/attachment"

So, depending on the constraints on the server at
that moment, the size/shape of the mailfolder file
will change drastically.

Note: The server may move only some attachments to
external URLs so I don't think I can rely on
content-negotiation to solve this problem.  Note
also that even if I force all attachments to be
external-URLs, I still want the server to be able
to change those locations unilaterally.

Any thoughts on how to solve this without forcing
the client to GET the entire folder each time?

When you GET, is the response a list of current messages or the actual

I'd go with a list of messages &amp; use last-modified/if-modified-since, etc.
to check for new messages.

Get a collection of references to messages, each with a little metadata.
Retrieve content with later requests.


-- ask for snapshot of inbox, providing username/password --
GET /pop/user-99/inbox/ HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Basic WZYSHS=

-- snapshot of inbox --
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;folder&gt;
 &lt;item href='/pop/user-99/msgs/msg1024' from='joe@...' /&gt;

Again, my initial instinct here was that I could

Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the new

changing all the URLs in the folder could
radically change its length, thereby precluding
use of range headers to get new messages.

Does this make sense now?

on a per-message basis whether to return the

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] ReST and Representing Mailboxes<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>A couple thoughts:

1) Use HEAD to determine if the contents have changed.  This keeps you from
having to get the entire resource.

2) There is nothing in REST that says the URI must identify a specific
directory location.  As a result, you could create the necessary URIs up
front and just keep an internal map to the actual location.  If the server
wants to move an attachment, it just needs to update the map.  The URI will
still "point to"  the attachment (i.e. the resource/representation isn't any
different).  If you are doing this across multiple web servers, you could
also use the map table to instead return an appropriate HTTP 301 "Moved
Permanently" or 302 "Found" to redirect the client to the actual URI.

3) I am uneasy about the range feature of HTTP.  It doesn't feel very
extensible to me (e.g. if you message format changed, range calculations
would have to change as well).

4) (this is more of a question to the whole list) Would it be RESTful to
maintain a resource whose response to a GET only contained the new items?
For instance, suppose after each successful GET of a mail message, the
client were to POST the URI to this resource.  On a GET of this resource,
the server would return all message URIs for which it had not been notified
of by the POST(s).  This technique would also obviate the need for the HTTP
range technique.

No doubt the contents have changed.  The issue is
that since I know the contents simply grow, if I
prohibited the server from changing URLs, I could
retrieve only the new messages by using range
headers to retrieve all content beyond the
content-length I have received so far.

The problem here is how to retrieve only the new
messages if the length of old messages changes
(perhaps because of changes in the length of the
URLs to which the metadata points).

I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  I

does not actually include the actual URL but
intead includes the URL of a redirect to the
actual URL, but that doubles server round trips
and I would like to avoid that as well.

Yes, that is exactly why range headers don't

Hmm, this looks interesting.  A variant of this
proposal would be for the server to return the URL
at which it will serve the next set of messages
even if those messages don't yet exist... I'm not
sure how RESTful that would be either.

Not really.  An HTTP server's URI-space has nothing whatsoever to do
with its storage space, aside from that created by the handlers within
that space.  In other words, what you name the URIs and how the messages
are extracted from relevant storage is defined entirely by the handler
you write for the URIs.  See mod_mbox, for example.

You would only need to use the redirection if you do not have direct access
to the attachment location.  However, if you do, then imagine the following:

A message is posted with one attachment.  The URI created for that one
attachment is:

    http://www.sample.invalid/mail/attachments/1032

Now, conventional "static" servers would have the particular path mapped to
a folder such as:

c:\inetput\wwwroot\mail\attachments\1032

However, the above path could also just be treated as a key into a map/table
that pointed to the actual directory location:

key        path
1030      d:\extraspace\1030\
1031      d:\extraspace\1031\
1032      \\remoteserver\data\attachments\45\
1033      \\removeserver\data\attachments\72\

Now, when someone does a GET on the above URI, you see where the server has
mapped the path to (in this case "\\remoteserver\data\attachments\45\") and
return the file(s) from there.  No redirections needed.  As Roy mentioned in
his reply, there is nothing in HTTP or REST that requires URI paths to match
directory paths.  That's an implementation feature of most web servers, but
just because it's a convenience for handling static resources.  Nothing in
the books says this is required...

&gt; &gt; client were to POST the URI to this resource.  On a GET of this
resource,
&gt; &gt; the server would return all message URIs for which it had not been
notified
&gt; &gt; of by the POST(s).  This technique would also obviate the need for the
HTTP
&gt; &gt; range technique.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm, this looks interesting.  A variant of this
&gt; proposal would be for the server to return the URL
&gt; at which it will serve the next set of messages
&gt; even if those messages don't yet exist... I'm not
&gt; sure how RESTful that would be either.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I wasn't clear.  There may be a large
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of messages and, ideally, I only want the
&gt; &gt; &gt; client to retrieve new messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, my initial instinct here was that I could
&gt; &gt; &gt; use range-headers (because the mailbox only
&gt; &gt; &gt; grows), but, even if I just return metadata, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to give the server the option of moving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; actual messages to different URLs.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the new
&gt; &gt; &gt; URL will have the same length as the old.  So
&gt; &gt; &gt; changing all the URLs in the folder could
&gt; &gt; &gt; radically change its length, thereby precluding
&gt; &gt; &gt; use of range headers to get new messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this make sense now?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; -Alex-
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PS I really want the server to be able to choose
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a per-message basis whether to return the
&gt; &gt; &gt; whole message or simply a URL but URL changes
&gt; &gt; &gt; illustrate my pount sufficiently well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to figure out how to create a ReST
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interface to a mailfolder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Initially, I figured I could simply POST messages
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have them appended to the mailfolder and then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GET with range-headers to see if anyone has added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything new since the last time I checked the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; folder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you GET, is the response a list of current messages or the
actual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; content of the messages?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd go with a list of messages &amp; use
last-modified/if-modified-since,
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to check for new messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts on how to solve this without forcing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the client to GET the entire folder each time?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get a collection of references to messages, each with a little
metadata.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Retrieve content with later requests.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- ask for snapshot of inbox, providing username/password --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GET /pop/user-99/inbox/ HTTP/1.1
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Authentication: Basic WZYSHS=
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- snapshot of inbox --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Content-Type: text/xml
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;folder&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;item href='/pop/user-99/msgs/msg1024' from='joe@...' /&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/folder&gt;

&gt; see if anyone has added anything new since
&gt; the last time I checked the folder.
If 'checking' is both safe and idempotent, you will have to explicitly mark
messages as being viewed/processed/whatever.
You could do this many ways - send a 'mark all inbox items', send a list of
items to mark, assign URIs to each item &amp; mark each inbox item, etc..

&gt; Any thoughts on how to solve this without forcing
&gt; the client to GET the entire folder each time?
If you mark items as being processed, this can move them to a separate
collection - the 'viewed' list or the 'deleted' list or whatever.
Then when you check for new messages, the 'inbox' list will be empty when
there are no new messages.
You will always need to check periodically, but the response can be empty
which cuts down on data transfer.

I think this is similar to the 'model a message queue with HTTP' discussion
of a few months ago....

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I think I have figured out how to do this in a way
that allows the server to move attachments to URLs
on other servers on an ad-hoc basis and that does
not require servers to maintain current view-state
for every client.  Please tell me if this solution
is too HTTP abusive.

Initially, the client makes a simple GET request
to the URL of the mailfolder.  The server returns:

  200 OK
  Content-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="abc"
  Etag: my-etag

Now, if the client want to receive only what has
changed since my-etag, it sends:

  GET /folder/url HTTP/1.1
  If-None-Match: my-etag
  Accept: multipart/byteranges

The question is whether the server is now allowed
to send a multipart/byteranges response.  RFC2616
prohibits a 206 response if the client did not
explicitly make a range request, but I think the
semantics of content negotiation would certainly
allow the server to make a 200 response with
partial content if it so desired.

What I would really like to do is have the server
return a content-range header with a
multipart/digest response.  Is there a way I can
make that legal in response to a request with a
"accept-content-range" header?

Any thoughts?

I don't think it's abusive, but I think you are trying to do too much with
HTTP.


&gt; Now, if the client want to receive only what has

&gt;
&gt;   GET /folder/url HTTP/1.1

Why don't you just use a query term like 'received-since' to indicate what
set of inbox messages you are talking about?

I think you would do better to have an "inbox" URI, which only contains new
messages.  Once you have received a specific message (indicated via the
inbox), POST its URI to the URI of the mail resource you want it to be put
in:

POST /mail/trash

http://sample.invalid/mail/inbox/0013


This would remove the link from the inbox and place it in the "trash".  Of
course, you could always just DELETE the URI directly if you were done with
it.

At any rate, all you would ever have to do to check for mail would be to
"GET /mail/inbox".

Simple and clean... I think.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed since my-etag, it sends:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   GET /folder/url HTTP/1.1
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   If-None-Match: my-etag
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Accept: multipart/byteranges
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why don't you just use a query term like 'received-since' to
indicate
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set of inbox messages you are talking about?

<pre>Each client checks mail at different times so each
client has a different set of messages it has read
and messages it has not yet read.

If the client changes the state of the server to
differentiate between the two then the server
needs to maintain state for each client.

&gt; &gt; If you accepted receive-since, you could always
&gt; &gt; refer to a particular message-id.  I just think
&gt; &gt; either version violates the opacity of URLs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem with using POST or DELETE is that the
&gt; &gt; server now has to maintain read state for each
&gt; &gt; client and you now have an administrative process
&gt; &gt; each time you add a client.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This would remove the link from the inbox and place it in the "trash".
&gt; Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course, you could always just DELETE the URI directly if you were done

&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At any rate, all you would ever have to do to check for mail would be to

&gt; Isn't adding a query term "received-since" unRESTful?
I don't think so. But I am not bothered by constructing URIs on the client.

Also, I meant 'modified-since' - I mis-edited the paragraph before sending
it. It is intended to represent a resource that is a list of items that have
been modified since a certain time.

If I understand what you are trying to do, you have a single resource with a
list of messages. The content of the response may change somewhere in the
middle - e.g. the href attribute of the fifth item.
You would like to talk to this same resource, yet receive only those
portions (or items) that have changed since some previous response,
indicated by either eTag or last-modified or something.
The change to the resource isn't that a new message has arrived - you can
use the 'mark and move' approach to clean out the inbox for that - but that
the storage location of attachments has changed.

If you have multiple collections of messages, then each collection of
messages probably needs to support this 'list only changed items since xyz'
capability.

I can't help but think that using byte-range is fragile - deltas on dynamic
content seems problematic. I'd recommend a content format that is more
suited to having the client merge updates to a list of items.

&gt; Using something like "receive-since" (I am assuming a timestamp here)
means
&gt; that you have to keep track of the time differences between the client and
&gt; server, since you need to query the server according to its own time, not
&gt; the clients.
There a Last-Modified response header that should work.

&gt;
&gt; I think you would do better to have an "inbox" URI, which only contains
new
&gt; messages.  Once you have received a specific message (indicated via the
&gt; inbox), POST its URI to the URI of the mail resource you want it to be put
&gt; in:
I think this is a good approach for managing the messages, notifying that
they were processed, etc.
But I think the problem S. Alexander is trying to solve has to do with
metadata changing on a listing of items - and getting a list of just the
changed items.

Using a header like If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match doesn't change what
the resource represents - I don't think they can be used to filter out
unmodified items in a list. I think you need to have separate resources to
do the filtering

<pre>Isn't the whole point of REST that URIs should be
opaque when describing a web service?

Regarding what I am trying to do, I want to expose
a mailfolder via HTTP.  Three things may happen
to this mailfolder:

* The server may choose to move attachments to
   external URLs
* The server may change those external URLs
* New messages may be added to the folder
Note: Messages will not be deleted from the folder.

I want clients:
1. to be able to rertrieve the entire folder
2. to be able to retreive only messages that have
   been added to the folder without retrieving
   already received messages whose representations
   have changed

I would like to have a large number of anonymous
clients so I don't want to force the server to
maintain a state for each client (as required by
'mark and move' servers).

My proposed solution is to return
multipart/byteranges as a response to queries with
etags.  I suppose I could also return any diff
format, but I'm not aware of one that is
particularly better suited to this problem than
multipart/byteranges.

Is the consensus that this is HTTP-OK, and if so
what is the correct status code to return?

&gt; 2. to be able to retreive only messages that have
&gt;    been added to the folder without retrieving
&gt;    already received messages whose representations
&gt;    have changed
So for #2 you want 'all messages I haven't seen', regardless whether there
are messages that have been seen and modified (with updated URL to
attachments)? I thought you /did/ want to see messages that have changed,
even though they are old messages.


&gt; My proposed solution is to return
&gt; multipart/byteranges as a response to queries with
&gt; etags.
It seems like you are trying to use a single logical resource to do both
these tasks, and it may be much easier if you use two or more resources.

I don't know if it is 'correct' to use the same URI but different ETags to
achieve different representations. Perhaps it is, and this might be an
elegant way of doing it.

&gt; I suppose I could also return any diff
&gt; format, but I'm not aware of one that is
&gt; particularly better suited to this problem than
&gt; multipart/byteranges.
Like I said, binary deltas bother me - I'd go with record based deltas,
rather than byte index based.
You may run into problems with versioning between client and server. The
byte range for older version may not be compatible with newer versions,
whereas record based is easier to consume.

No, the point of REST is to model a Web service.  It wouldn't be 
complete
if it neglected to include query parameters.  However, it works best 
when
query parameters are only used read-only and result in a list of
metadata and specific resource identifiers.  You can then do more 
complex
operations on those identifiers.

So, you are talking netnews, not mail.  That means the client has to
keep a list of read messages, not the server, and the list should be
by ordered number (the easiest choice given what you describe and
how all news readers work).

&gt; My proposed solution is to return
&gt; multipart/byteranges as a response to queries with
&gt; etags.  I suppose I could also return any diff
&gt; format, but I'm not aware of one that is

&gt;
&gt; Is the consensus that this is HTTP-OK, and if so

No, it is not HTTP okay because you allow the server to change the
file.  Neither etag nor byteranges will work.  In any case, this design
would tie the client implementation to the server storage 
implementation,
which is just a bad idea in general.  You should separate the two and
think of each message as a resource within a collection (the mailbox).
The client will then have to remember what has been read if they
wish to selectively retrieve messages.

I've also written up a document that explains the examples.  There

AOLserver/PyWX (PyWX provides access to AOLserver's API) and about
how this is "a good thing".  It's pretty elementary stuff.  But, it
might be useful to someone new to Quixote and REST.

Subject:POST vs. PUT<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Ok so I have read through all the Wiki pages but still have a 
question on when to use POST vs. PUT.  I am going to post a few 
scenerios and what I think the correct behavior should be and would 
like some help on whether or not I am understanding things correctly.

Lets say I have an address book which contains contacts stored using 
a server defined ID.  Each contact contains a name, phone number and 
email address.

Adding a new contact (I belive this is correct):

POST new contact to /addressbook, server returns 201 along with the 
URI of the new contact.

Modify a contact (This is where I need help):

I want to modify only the name for the resource located 
at /addressbook/000001, do I POST the changes to the name or do I 
PUT them.  Also, do I need to PUT the entire record or just the 
changes?

Thanks for the help,

Josh

If you use PUT you need to send the complete data for the resource - which I
think is messed up in the protocol but I'm not a protocol guy (there are
reasons like caching,etc that may require this behavior).
So, use PUT to do a 'partial update' of a resource. You could also define a
more fine-grained resource and PUT to that...

-- option 1 : partial update via POST --
POST /addressbook/0001 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: nnnn

&lt;contact&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;bob&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;phone&gt;425-555-1212&lt;/phone&gt;
 &lt;email&gt;bob@...&lt;/email&gt;
&lt;/contact&gt;


-- option 2 : fine-grained update via PUT --
PUT /addressbook/0001;email HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: nnnn

&lt;email&gt;bob@...&lt;/email&gt;

<pre>Thanks Mike that helps, one question though.  You say, "So, use PUT to
do a 'partial update' of a resource".  Did you mean to say POST because
this contradicts your first sentence where you say you have to send the
complete data when using PUT.

Subject:Another "is this ReSTful" question<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi --

I'm building a simple order management web service which allows an
order app in the field to submit orders, allows factory-side apps
to access orders by order number, allows factory-side apps to access
the set of unseen orders directly, and allows a factory-side app
to mark an order as seen.

I envision having a top-level uri for the service which returns a
document containing the uris needed to use the service.  The uris would
be something like

    &lt;order-service-uris&gt;
	&lt;submit uri="/orders" /&gt;
	&lt;get-order-by-number uri="/order-numbers" /&gt;
	&lt;get-new-orders uri="/new-orders" /&gt;
    &lt;/order-service-uris&gt;

To submit an order, the client POSTs the order to /orders.

To find an order by order number, the client does a GET on
/order-numbers, which returns a page of metadata, like for instance:

    &lt;orders&gt;
	&lt;ranges&gt;
	    &lt;range begin="375" end="399" uri="/db/1201" /&gt;
	    &lt;range begin="400" end="424" uri="/db/14287" /&gt;
	&lt;/ranges&gt;
	&lt;singleton number="425" uri="/db/1798" /&gt;
	&lt;singleton number="426" uri="/db/1855" /&gt;
    &lt;/orders&gt;

I see the singletons as necessary because a partial range uri must be
kept forever in case someone cached it, yuck.  This way, when a range is
complete, it is allocated a permanent uri; until then it is returned as
a collection of singletons.

To get the list of unseen orders, the client does a GET on
/new-orders, which returns a page of metadata like the above except it's
all singletons.  The uris distributed through /order-numbers and
/new-orders are different for any given order, and:

To mark an order seen, the client does a DELETE on the uri acquired from
/new-orders.

Does this seem like a ReSTful interface?  All nitpicking is welcome, I'm
still trying to internalize Roy Fielding's dissertation and the comments
I've read here over the last month or so.

Gary Shea

I while ago there was some discussion about acknowledging messages or
marking a resource as being processed in some way - there was a comparison
between DELETE and POST with a body of 'status=seen'. I think the end result
was that if there are multiple status values (ready, locked, finished, etc.)
then you would POST the status (or PUT to a more detailed URI). If the
existence of the resource is all the indication needed, then DELETE probably
will work fine. Since you have two distinct URIs for 'new-orders' and
'acknowledged orders' - deleting the one resource merely removes the
relationship that the order is 'new' (or however you want to think of it)
rather than deleting the order itself.

&gt; I'm not clear on what the begin/end range means - could you explain?
&gt; Is an individual order addressable?

Sorry, I could have been more clear.

An individual order is addressable.  The idea was to find an individual
order by traversing an n-ary tree of uris.  Inner nodes of the tree map
a range of order numbers to a child node of the tree.  The desired
order's uri would be found in a leaf of the tree.

I took this (baroque?) approach because the uri /order/by-number/2275 is
so not opaque!  It felt more ReSTful to act like a browser and follow
a chain of links to get where I needed to go.  The performance cost is
not likely to be significant, given the predicted order load.  Plus,
if the process that traverses the tree has any kind of lifetime, it can
cache everything, as none of the links change.

Too weird?

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I see the singletons as necessary because a partial range uri must be
&gt; &gt; kept forever in case someone cached it, yuck.  This way, when a range is
&gt; &gt; complete, it is allocated a permanent uri; until then it is returned as

That makes sense.  One of the next steps will be associating a status
with each order so this is very relevant!  Using POST as you describe
sounds like the way to go for updating the order status.  If I think of
NOT_SEEN as the initial status, I could use the POST as you describe to
set the status to SEEN.  So if the order is located at /order/2345,
I could post to /order/2345/status, for instance.

&gt; I took this (baroque?) approach because the uri /order/by-number/2275 is
&gt; so not opaque!

Your choice to use one URI over another doesn't indicate whether the URI is
opaque or not.  It's a matter of whether the client attempts to treat it as
anything more than an identifier or not that determines whether it's opaque.
A RESTful client treats *all* URIs as opaque (though there has been some
blurring of that stance lately, it seems).

I think the common confusion about opacity is whether it's perceived as
"human understandable" or not.  The path you give could certainly be
interpreted by a human beyond "it's an identifier", even though it
shouldn't.  Suppose instead that you were to have used the path /19394BC3EA.
At first blush, one might say this URI is "more opaque".  However, it is no
more opaque than your example above if the client knows attempts to
interpret it (e.g. knows the encoding scheme you use) beyond "it's an
identifier".  It is certainly less "human understandable", but that doesn't
necessarily make it more opaque.

If security is an issue, then remember that using /19394BC3EA instead of
/order/by-number/2275 is only "security by obscurity", which not the way to
go.  So... why give up a particular format that makes development easier?
You don't gain anything by it, IMHO.

Not weird. Sounds very hypertextual. I'm not sold on that being the best
approach though.
My reasoning is that the client needs to know the document format and
meaning - particular element names and the fact that they are relative
references to more data that needs retrieval. Requiring that the client know
the URI format and meaning - particular path segments or query terms - seems
very similar to being coupled to document format.
The client and server both share knowledge of a value space - the actual
order number. This shared knowledge is required in both scenarios - you need
to know what order number to look for in the list of leaf nodes for example.
If knowledge of particular order numbers did not exist then finding a
particular order is not possible.
Describing that the server accepts order numbers in a portion of a URI as
opposed to describing that the server reports the order numbers in a portion
of XML content isn't much different to me.
Perhaps I'm just biased to using URI query terms to do lookup because it is
simple to code and easy to understand.


&gt; That makes sense.  One of the next steps will be associating a status
&gt; with each order so this is very relevant!  Using POST as you describe

&gt; I could post to /order/2345/status, for instance.
You could POST to /order/2345 directly - POST can be used for partial update
of a resource. If you have a resource which represents the status directly,
you could PUT to that instead (but I have problems with the defined behavior
of PUT).

There's two parts to this though: explaining the notion of visibility, and 
then explaining the benefits of it.

For the notion of visibility... maybe the closest thing I can think of is 
"facade" or "proxy" patterns, though that doesn't capture it very well.

As for the benefits... I think that's not so hard to explain. Personally, I'm 
not convinced visibility is always a good thing... it opens you up to 
spoofing etc.

You need to be drinking way less caffein, my friend.

Can you give a brief rundown of the approaches you've tried and

The "it" is what visibility is, and why it's good, though I think if
the former is recognized, the latter will be clear.

FWIW, and to answer Seairth, here's a quote from Roy's dissertation;

"[...]What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines that originate services.[...]"

I've tried explaining;

- why caching works
- how firewalls do their job
- the "exploding number of methods" problem
- the coordination language view
- syntax vs. semantics
- transport vs. transfer

I can't tell you why it's not getting through.  Part of it for a lot

that the person beside you believes the same thing.  There's also the

Okay, what I get out of this is that the benefit is that intermediaries can
do cool things if it knows the intent of the request - and that requires a)
finding the intent (the method/operation) of the message and 2) having a
manageable number of intentions do deal with.

I'd love to contribute, but even after reading [1], I'm not sure I 
understand the connection, although do I believe there is one (somewhere 
just beyond the reach of my brain).  In addition, I don't really 
understand what Miles is trying to get at in the included message below,

&gt;  
&gt;
I've never understood this kind of logic.  It seems to me that this kind 
of thinking leads exactly to what happens with filtering/blocking 
software - lots of false positives because the software can only grok 
syntax and hasn't a clue about semantics.  I don't know about anyone 
else, but I'd prefer that my firewall not suffer false positives when 
trying to determine whether traffic from a partner is allowed through.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I don't believe that application-level semantics are likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;to be accessible to anything, intermediary or otherwise, without it
&gt;&gt;&gt;having some sort of prior knowledge of those semantics (this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;just the good ol' end-to-end principle).
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Wouldn't the prior knowledge of HTTP application semantics by an HTTP
&gt;&gt;intermediary qualify?  I would agree that, for example, an SMTP
&gt;&gt;message isn't visible to an HTTP intermediary.  But there's shared
&gt;&gt;knowledge on application semantics in the HTTP/HTTP case.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If the _whole_ content of the application and it's semantics can be 
&gt;derived from RFC 2616, then yes. HTTP semantics are visible to HTTP 
&gt;intermediaries.
&gt;
&gt;But as acres of earlier mail should have made clear, I don't believe 
&gt;that the semantics of Web services can be fully captured at the level 
&gt;of HTTP.
&gt;
&gt;Let's face it, HTTP isn't even enough for plain hypertext ... the HTML 
&gt;REC isn't an appendix of RFC 2616 ;-)

I look at the list above and it occurs to me that an "aha" moment may not be
needed in the end.  As RPC-style infrastructures proliferate, the features
you mention (caching, firewalls, simple interface, etc) will begin to
crumble (e.g. ineffective caching, overloaded firewalls, administrating a
never-ending list of interfaces/methods, etc.) around them.  They will throw
more hardware and more complex software at the problem.  And when they
discover that this isn't solving the problem (and they *will* discover
that), they will start to look around for alternatives.  And they will see
REST.  They will see applications running in ways that their own can't.  And
they will finally begin to see the light...

What better way of showing how REST is better than RPC than to let them see
how bad RPC can get?

Then again, if people don't want to see, then they won't see.

I think you hit the nail on the head there - mental models are hard to 
change.  People are used to RPC for network-based applications, and SOAP 
provides exactly that.  That and the fact that you've taken something 
they're familiar with and sprinkled it with the magic pixie dust that is 
the web and XML; how can it not be the ultimate application platform? :-/

Seriously, though, I expect that a lot of people just don't see the 
relevance of your arguments because they have the wrong mental model.   
 When you're doing RPC, it isn't clear that caching RPC messages has 
much benefit.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have decided to implement a RESTful "mail" system.  The design I have come
up with is incredibly simple, flexible, and (i believe) even RESTful (no,

look around at what others are doing.  Anyone know of any RESTful (from the
ground up, preferably) "mail" systems out there already?


In the end, my objective is to get a simple, easily visible RESTful
application on the web and used by lots of people (the latter part is
possibly more important that the former part).  As I have been reading the
"visibility" thread, I got to thinking that (other than letting people
discover for themselves the pitfalls of RPC) people would be more receptive
to REST if they could actually see something RESTful.  I know the Web itself
is RESTful, but it's hard to convince someone of the legitimacy of a term
that came after the application that demonstrated it.  Coming up with
something *new* would, imho, be an easier thing to digest and understand to
the REST skeptics out there.


To that end, if anyone is interested in working with me on this, I will

I vote 'yes' to the visible project; 'not sure' to the mail system as the
subject of that project.  Meanwhile, Hao He is trying to get his company
(Thomson Legal &amp; Regulatory) to release on of the REST projects
he did there to open source, for the same purpose.

One way or the other, Mark, I think the 'visible project' thing is
key right now.

I was wondering how RESTful Microsoft HTTPMail spec is after
reading article at http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/.

Recently, I found there's a project trying to document/implement
this spec:

    http://httpmail.sourceforge.net/

Maybe you can use this as a basis for your implementation?
It doesn't provide everything you're looking for, but I believe
it could be added without breaking any compatibility.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm trying to convince a group of fellow employees that they should develop
an internal webapp RESTfully instead of using SOAP/XML-RPC and friends. The
client in this context isn't a web browser but instead a java application.
One argument in favor of SOAP is that the java toolkits, client and server,
are pretty good, while with RESTful HTTP, the server toolkits are pretty
good while clients aren't so much.

Do y'all buy this argument? Can anyone recommend a very good HTTP client
for RESTful application development in java?

I strongly agree that the clients need work to be more fully RESTful. I

well, availability/stability for one... :) seriously, you've got, what,
three basic choices?

1. java.net.URL and java.net.URLConnection, which barely qualifies as
usable

2. http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ which isn't actively
maintained

3. http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/ which is stuck in
perpetual alpha

I would think if you were looking to develop a REST client application,
you'd want a client toolkit that made some things easy on you - simple
things like setting a base URL for a series of requests, easy
authentication... maybe more complex things like associating expected
response codes / response message formats to requests with callback methods
for success or failure. I don't know, I'm in pure speculation mode here,
never having written a non-browser-based REST client, but I guess I don't
see anything in the Java side of things at least that compares favorably
with the RPC toolkits.

Certainly any and all of those could be built on top of the existing http
clients. I guess I'm asking if anyone's aware of anything good that _has_
been written already. If not, why not, and what would a good toolkit look
like?

From: "Chuck Hinson" &lt;cmhinson@...&gt;

&gt; I don't know if I buy this or not.  What is it about Java client tools
&gt; that is lacking from a REST perspective?

The kind of things I find missing are:
 - simplicity
 - message structure &amp; content awareness
 - efficiency

1 Simplicity
The built-in HTTPUrlConnection helps deal with the network connection
between client and server, rather than simplify access to remote resources.
It has methods like:
 connection.setRequestMethod(String)
 String connection.getResponseMessage()

I would rather see classes and methods that reflect resources and messages
something like:
class Server
{
 void setAuthInfo(AuthInfo info);
 void setHeaders(HashMap defaultHeaders);
 void setHost(String defaultHost);

 Response get(String uri);
 Response post(String uri,Content body);
 Response put(String uri,Content body);
 Response delete(String uri);
}

There are problems with this particular approach, but it illustrates that
the code talks about application concepts rather than network concepts.

2 Message &amp; Content awareness
The built-in URLConnection provides either stream or string views of
response messages. You can use ContentFactory support to inject your own
content parsing to spin up whatever object wrapping the response data, but I
don't see a good wrapper class.
I'd like to see classes like Response and Content

class Response
{
    String getHeader(String name);
    Content getContent();
}

class Content
{
    String getType();

    // used with multipart
    Vector getParts();

    String getBody();
    byte[] getBytes();
    InputStream getStream();
}

3 Efficiency
Mainly this is support of HTTP 1.1 and keepalive. I'm not sure the default
client supports keepalive - it probably does but I'm not sure.

On Thu, 9 Jan 2003, at 13:57 [-0500], Seairth Jacobs (seairth@...)...:

&gt; one clarification below...
&gt;
&gt; ----- Original Message -----
&gt; From: "Gary Shea" &lt;shea@...&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I took this (baroque?) approach because the uri /order/by-number/2275 is
&gt; &gt; so not opaque!
&gt;
&gt; Your choice to use one URI over another doesn't indicate whether the URI is
&gt; opaque or not.  It's a matter of whether the client attempts to treat it as
&gt; anything more than an identifier or not that determines whether it's opaque.
&gt; A RESTful client treats *all* URIs as opaque (though there has been some
&gt; blurring of that stance lately, it seems).
&gt;
&gt; I think the common confusion about opacity is whether it's perceived as
&gt; "human understandable" or not.  The path you give could certainly be
&gt; interpreted by a human beyond "it's an identifier", even though it
&gt; shouldn't.  Suppose instead that you were to have used the path /19394BC3EA.
&gt; At first blush, one might say this URI is "more opaque".  However, it is no
&gt; more opaque than your example above if the client knows attempts to
&gt; interpret it (e.g. knows the encoding scheme you use) beyond "it's an
&gt; identifier".  It is certainly less "human understandable", but that doesn't
&gt; necessarily make it more opaque.

I completely agree with your points about opacity of URIs.  I don't
think they are relevant to this case though.

The question is, how do I get access to a specific order document, given
the order number.

My original proposal was to do a tree search in a heirarchy of index
pages, where the order number guides the search.  In some index leaf
page a pointer to the actual URI would be found.  There would be no way
to interpret the URI structure, because it doesn't have any: the
mapping from order numbers to URIs is basically random.  Completely
opaque.

The alternative approach suggested by S. Mike Dierken was to put
the order number in the uri.  Easy to interpret, totally not opaque.
The client must know the significance of the final URI component in
order to use the service.

So, which method is more ReSTful?  To me the first one is ReSTful, the
second one isn't, but Mike obviously has been thinking about ReST longer
than I have... so I accept that I'm probably missing something.

My sense is that if the goal is: "Given a set of parameters, find the
corresponding URI", there is only one ReSTful alternative, namely the
inefficient search method described above.  A solution that involves
putting search information in a document and getting back a URI is
RPC like (the intention is not described by the choice of
PUT/POST/blah), and a solution that puts the search criteria in the URL
requires that the structure of the URL be well-defined and so violates
opaqueness.  Eeek!

Regards,

	Gary

Not actually completely opaque. The client needs to know the format and
structure of two documents. Either that's hardcoded - and hard things are
brittle - or the server describes the format (which gets you into a
recursive definition of how you describe information and find what you want
from that description).
If you go with the server description approach, then the server can just as
easily describe the format of the URI. If the server changes the structure,
the defintion changes - clients automatically adopt the new format.

&gt; The alternative approach suggested by S. Mike Dierken was to put
&gt; the order number in the uri.  Easy to interpret, totally not opaque.
Add in a server description of how to construct the URI and you reduce the
coupling. I do realize that constructing URIs can be avoided in many
situations, but I think it adds implementation complexity for not a lot of
benefit. Just my opinion though.

&gt; My sense is that if the goal is: "Given a set of parameters, find the
&gt; corresponding URI", there is only one ReSTful alternative, namely the
&gt; inefficient search method described above.
Well stated goal. And very good question - is there only one RESTful
approach?
I see two non-URI based approaches
 a) successive GETs and matching against response content
 b) POSTing some content with the parameter (the purchase order number) and
receiving the actual location

The URI-based approach might be simpler to implement, and a server-provided
description of the structure of the URI reduces coupling, but defining a URI
structure probably is going to limit the server to hosting the resources in
a simple container (like a database) otherwise the description gets too
complicated (although a re-direct would let you put things anywhere else
too). Using the non-URI based approaches lets you put the resources anywhere
on the Web.

So... for me, I'd do something simple when the job is simple and do
something large when the problem is large. Small steps toward automation are
better than no steps at all.

<pre>I just read Paul's article.
I like the basic idea.  I would just like so
suggest using RFC2017 for notifications.

RFC2017 defines:
Content-Type: Message/External-Body; access-type=URL; URL="http://foo.com/path"

Using that in combination with the
content-description header described in RFC2045
basically achieves what you need in the way of
notification documents.

You can use these mimetype as part of a transition
to HTTP mail.  If you send email using this
format, an increasing number of clients will
recognize it.

The only remaining problem is replacing POP/IMAP.
It would be nice if mailclients could expose HTTP,
but often that is not possible.  My suggestion for
retrieving new mail is again to use this header in
combination with multipart-byteranges.

You treat an INBOX (or newsgroup) as a
multipart/digest document.  Each message in the
digest should have an external-body.

If you want to see what has arrived since the
last time you checked, make a request with an
if-modified-since: etag

The server then returns a multipart/byteranges
document of all messages that have arrived since
that etag was generated.  The nice thing here is
that multipart/byteranges have the same syntax as
multipart/digest, so a client can just process the
returned data using any multipart handler.

Joe,

Interesting stuff. Have you thought about generalizing it a bit? I mean, I
prefer RSS 1.0 to RSS 2.0, and I think RESTlog would be more useful if you
didn't specify so much about how messages are stored on the server side;
both physically and w/r/t to format...

It might be nice to make a capability discovery URI, like:

http://foo.bar/message-types

which one could GET and which would return an XML doc (actually, RDF would
be ideal for this) describing which formats the RESTlog could understand and
store, among other things.

In other words, RESTlog looks neat, but if I were going to use it for
projects, I'd want to store messages not in files on the filesystem but in,
say, ZODB (or MySQL), and I'd want to have more flexibility in the sorts of
message types a client could expect to POST.

I think it might have been spawned by Paul Prescod's "First Principles"

<pre>Why not just have the server return an

If clients have a preference between RSS1.0 and
RSS2.0 they should also use the accept header.

I think the relevenant mimetypes are
text/xml+rss1.0 and text/xml+rss2.0

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
There are different types of headers
PUT Accepts input
GET Accepts input
POST Accepts input
HEAD ???
TRACE ???
OPTIONS ???
DELETE ???

I know that PUT,GET,POST accept inputs. I tried to add
inputs to TRACE but it didn't work, I got 400 as my
response code. I was wondering whether TRACE doesn't
accept inputs. 

Where can I find more information regarding each of
these request types and their behaviour.

Thanx,

&gt; Why not just have the server return an

The immediate reason is that Accept: is a request header, not a response
header.
But since I don't know of a standard way for a resource to advertise its
various representations or to advertise its acceptable content, I think a
simple approach like you suggest sounds neat.

This should probably be posted to www-talk also

Note: there is an Allow response header listing the supported methods...

Subject:opaqueness of URI<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; So, which method is more ReSTful?  To me the first one is ReSTful, the
&gt; second one isn't, but Mike obviously has been thinking about ReST 
&gt; longer
&gt; than I have... so I accept that I'm probably missing something.

Maybe I am missing something, but since several people have said that
REST implies opaqueness in the URI, my guess is that a legend
has somehow begun and I need to put it to rest (no pun intended).

REST does not require that a URI be opaque.  The only place where
the word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I complain about the
opaqueness of cookies.  In fact, RESTful applications are, at all times,
encouraged to use human-meaningful, hierarchical identifiers in order
to maximize the serendipitous use of the information beyond what is
anticipated by the original application.

It is still necessary for the server to construct the URIs and for the
client to initially discover those URIs via hypertext responses, either
in the normal course of creating the resource or by some form of query
that results in a hypertext list.  However, once that list is provided,
people can and do anticipate the names of other/future resources in
that name space, just as I would often directly type URIs into the
location bar rather than go through some poorly designed interactive
multi-page interface for stock charts.

Sites that rely on interstitial advertising (like the annoying yahoo
groups interface) do not like it when user's avoid the indirect path,
but the social network-effect of the Web is enhanced by meaningful URI.
In general, sites that give meaningful URI are used more often.

It also helps prevent the "lost in hyperspace" syndrome, but that's
a separate issue.

&gt; See section 19.6.2.1 of RFC 2068,
RFC 2068 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
19.6.2.1 Alternates
   The Alternates response-header field has been proposed as a means for
   the origin server to inform the client about other available
   representations of the requested resource, along with their
   distinguishing attributes,

&gt; section 8.3 of RFC 2295 and
RFC 2295 - Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP
8.3 Alternates
   The Alternates response header is used to convey the list of variants
   bound to a negotiable resource.  This list can also include
   directives for any content negotiation process.  If a response from a
   transparently negotiable resource includes an Alternates header, this
   header MUST contain the complete variant list bound to the negotiable
   resource

&gt; section 19.6.3 (last paragraph) of RFC 2616.
RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
19.6.3 Changes from RFC 2068
The Alternates, Content-Version, Derived-From, Link, URI, Public and
   Content-Base header fields were defined in previous versions of this
   specification, but not commonly implemented. See RFC 2068.


&gt; There is no means I am aware of to
&gt; inform the client about acceptable media types for POST/PUT/...
&gt; requests, but a server will send status 415 if the request entity media
&gt; type is unsupported.

Thanks for the info! Good stuff.

If Alternates indicates the media type for a representation of a resource -
and PUT will store that representation, while not explicit, it may make
sense to try using Alternates as the acceptable format for a PUT. I'd rather
have a more explicit mechanism though, since Alternates seems connected with
GET.

Thanks. I have been slowly trying to seperate out the documentation into 
'specification'
and 'implementation'. Based on your feedback I added some more verbage to
make the distinction clearer. Let me know if it's sufficient:

http://wellformedweb.org/news/2

&gt;
&gt; It might be nice to make a capability discovery URI, like:
&gt;
&gt; http://foo.bar/message-types
&gt;
&gt; which one could GET and which would return an XML doc (actually, RDF 
&gt; would
&gt; be ideal for this) describing which formats the RESTlog could

&gt;
Heheh, RDF isn't really a match philisophicly. Have you read my essay
that stimulated the creation of the WellFormedWeb site?
http://wellformedweb.org/story/1

Discovery is a big area and I have seen a lot of proposals in this area, 
from
RDF, the OPTIONS HTTP verb, WSIL, RSD, etc. This was discussed in relation
to RESTLog on [ucapi-discuss]:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ucapi-discuss/message/3

&gt;
&gt; In other words, RESTlog looks neat, but if I were going to use it for
&gt; projects, I'd want to store messages not in files on the filesystem 
&gt; but in,
&gt; say, ZODB (or MySQL), and I'd want to have more flexibility in the 
&gt; sorts of
&gt; message types a client could expect to POST.
&gt;
There is a mention of RSS 2.0 in the 'implementation' sections in
which demonstrate how I link up the individual 'item's into 'index.rss'. 
Now that's implementation
so we can safely ignore it. I.e. it's not part of the spec.

The other part where RSS 2.0 raises it's head is in the creation and 
editing of posts.
Are you asking that the 'item' fragment be from RSS 1.0? As I understand 
it that would
require putting the 'item' element in a different namespace. Is there 
any benefit
from making that change? Let me know if I am missing something.

You may also want to look at James Snell's proposed extensions to RESTLog:

There was an accouncement of a new book "Programming Web Services with Perl"
to XML-RPC list. I haven't read it myself yet, but it has two interesting

  - The REST methodology
  - The future of web services

Could it be the first book covering REST?

<pre>Yah, I thought long and hard about this recently due to Jon Udell's
ISBN-in-the-URI javascript hack.  There's no denying the value in that.

I figure it's one of those things with an upside and a downside.  The
upside is the serendipity.  The downside is serendipity.  8-)  What I
mean is that as a consumer of a URI, it's awesome to be able to get
more info and use it in unexpected ways.  But on the other hand, for
the URI publisher, you can't know what information people or software
may be extracting from your URI, and that ties your hands somewhat with
respect to how your URI space can evolve.

I used to think the problems with the latter outweighed the benefits
of the former, but I think it's the other way around now after seeing
it in action.  At least the publisher has the option of obfuscating
their URIs if they don't want to have to worry about it.

BTW, the RESTwiki's down due to a machine swap.  I'll have to fix it
this weekend.

Interesting.

I think you're saying that it's legitimate from a REST POV for a client 
to infer a URI pattern or template, eg.

  http://example.invalid/foo?foo=$1

or,

  http://example.invalid/foo/$1

where the client can substitute into the $1 position to obtain a URI and 
have some reasonable expectation that the server manages a 
corresponding resource.

These URI templates aren't URIs, clearly. They represent a family of 
related URIs: an infinite family if arbitrary substitutions into the 
template positions are acceptable; a finite family if the substutions 
should be drawn from a restricted set as in an HTML &lt;select&gt;.

But they do seem like identifiers for all that, even if only virtual/ 
derived and parasitic on the "true" identifiers which support them. 
What would support a clients expectation that substutions into,

  http://example.invalid/foo?foo=$1

would be likely to generate dereferencable URIs other than an assumption 
that the URI template effectively identifies a _process_ (or something 
equivalent) which is able to perform the inverse operation on the URI 
and extract the substitued-in value as a parameter for a computation?

I wonder if something like the above would go some way towards tweaking 
RFC 2396 3.4 in a REST-consistent direction?

A hierarchical namespace typically assigns semantics to each name in

It is difficult to write good descriptions for URI components given

Well, yeah.

I meant "reasonable" in the sense of "not completely ridiculous". It's 
surely more reasonable for a client to expect that if it which receives 
an HTML form with a GET action of,

  http://example.invalid/foo

and a control name of "foo" that,

  http://example.invalid/foo?foo=wibble

will identify a resource with a representation than it would be for it 
to expect that,

  http://example.invalid/foo/3lk4j5l3jkd84oikl

will (where the last path element it a client genarated random string).

&gt; Er, don't think too hard about it.  All URIs are URIs -- some

Right, but a URI _template_ isn't a URI. It's a pattern a client might 
instantiate to create a URI in the hope that that URI identifies a 
resource with a representation.

&gt; &gt; But they do seem like identifiers for all that, even if only
&gt; &gt; virtual/ derived and parasitic on the "true" identifiers which

OK, I'd be happy to replace "process" with "hierarchical namespace". 
That'd give us something like: a URI template identifies (in a 
virtual/derivative/parasitic sense) a hierarchical namespace maintained 
by the server-side application.

I think that's better than saying it identifies a process, if only 
because it's more general.

Agreed.

But 3.4 is scheme neutral now, and it might be possible to replace it 
with something more REST-consistent without losing that neutrality. 
Perhaps instead of,

  The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by
  the resource.

we could have something like,

  The presence of a query component suggests the existence of a
  family of resources with representations whose URIs vary in a
  well-defined but scheme-specific and server-dependent way.
  Applications which are aware the constraints of the scheme and the
  capabilities of the server MAY vary the query component in the
  expectation that the resulting URIs identify a resource with a
  representation.

Thoughts?

&gt; Jon Udell [1] has come up with extracting ISBNs from amazon links
&gt; and using them in other sites' query strings. He's recieved near
&gt; universal acclaim for doing so. If you buy into TBL's strong claim
&gt; (URI opacity is an axiom), or Paul Prescod's weaker variant (peeking
&gt; into URIs is a bad idea), then what Jon's done is a nasty hack (a la
&gt; screenscraping), and not has popular opinion has it, a neat hack.
&gt; Either way, this hack seems to offer considerable, immediate, utility.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe this an issue that needs to be punted onto the TAG. It seems
&gt; the web has a constaint over and above any of REST's (is that a first?).

The problem here is not that Jon extracted information out of the URI.  The
problem is that Jon is relying on Amazon to not change it's URIs in a way
that will break his technique.  Had Amazon said "one can extract ISBNs from
our URIs thus", then no one would be saying that what Jon did was a hack.
This all goes back to the/my thought that as long as the server (or server's
authority) dictates how a given URI is composed, then it should be perfectly
fine to extract information out of the URI.

As to whether the URI (or class of URIs) is opaque, I still think that they
are.  As long as the client conforms to the composition rule(s) given by the
server (the simplest case being a URI whose only rule is "this is the URI"),
then I don't see how those constructed URIs would be any different than if
the server returned all possible combinations that matched the given
composition rule(s).  Either way, they would still be "opaque".  It's only
when the client attempts to go outside of the composition rules that we get
in trouble.

Back to Jon's example above, Amazon has implictly told us (as most sites
implicitly do) that the only rule for their URIs is "this is the URI"
(ignoring any generated via a form or javascript).  Jon went outside of the
rules that Amazon provided, thus he is violating the opacity that TimBL
talks about.

IMHO, of course.... :)

authority to indicate in a computer-readable format the composition rules of

something like (loosely based on regex):

isbn = {regex pattern for ISBNs}

This would have two uses:

1) Allows the client to infer structure and create "valid" URIs that were
not explicitly given to them by the server.
2) Be able to extract information out or URIs that are explicitly given to
them by the server (obviously with a bit of human help).

If Jon had been given something like the above, he could have just told his
program to find the part that matches "isbn".  If Amazon chose to change the
(preferably, add a new) URI pattern to something like:

https?::/example.invalid/somepath/(isbn)/(nuflag)
isbn = {regex pattern for ISBNs}
nuflag = "new" | "used"

Jon's program would keep working because it still new where to find the
appropriate information.  This would allow looser coupling and high
cohesion.  Just a thought....

Donald Ball wrote:

&gt; I'm trying to convince a group of fellow employees that they
&gt; should develop an internal webapp RESTfully instead of using
&gt; SOAP/XML-RPC and friends. The client in this context isn't a web
&gt; browser but instead a java application. One argument in favor of
&gt; SOAP is that the java toolkits, client and server, are pretty
&gt; good, while with RESTful HTTP, the server toolkits are pretty
&gt; good while clients aren't so much.
&gt; 
&gt; Do y'all buy this argument? Can anyone recommend a very good HTTP
&gt; client for RESTful application development in java?

Asking for a toolkit suggests that you need/want several individual
tools.  You might want to begin by specifying the need for each
tool.  Let me give it a start:

1. Negotiate with the host/server -- Specify the headers. Specify
  the verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Make the HTTP request.  Get
  the response, the response code, the content.

2. Parse and process the content delivered by the server (i.e. the
  REST application) -- If the content is XML, this means using an
  XML parser and possibly translating the XML content into
  instances of classes in the native programming language.

3. Generate the content to be uploaded to the server (e.g. the
  content for POST requests) -- For example, if the information to
  be uploaded is contained in instances of classes in the
  programming language, then translate (export) these instances to
  XML or "extract" XML from them.

4. In some cases the client application will need to communicate
  with warm fingers and eyeballs -- Create a GUI to show content to
  the user, to accept input from the user, etc. A GUI toolkit, a
  form designer, etc would be helpful here.

The up-side of SOAP is that it does #1, #2, and #3 above for you. 
The down-side is (1) a severe restriction in flexibility and (2) a
large amount of specification creep and complexity growth.
Although, given enough companies producing enough specs (and
complexity), they may fix the restrictions.

For me, working in Python, negotiating with the host (#1 above) is
pretty easy, since there is a standard module (httplib) to help me. 
I'm guessing that Java has equivalent classes.  (Actually, a
subsequent follow-up argued that Java's support in this area is
weak.  I can't believe that.)

Also, parsing the content and generating content (#2 and #3) are
relatively easy, because I have an XML toolkit (PyXML) and I also
have a tool that I've written myself that turns XML Schema document
definitions into classes that can parse and represent an XML
document.  If you think this is what you need, you might want to
read about it and what it does, even though it is Python specific. 
Information is at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/#generateDS
    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html
        
And, I'm still thinking about the GUI stuff.

What other needs does a client and a client developer have? I'm
hoping that others will add ideas to this list of needs and tools
for client-side REST.  After all, recognizing and specifying out
needs is the first step toward filling them.  Or, as a psychiatrist
would tell you, admitting that you are ill is the first step toward
recovery (and paying the psychiatrist, of course).

Personally, I think is an absolutely terrible idea and leads to 
interfaces just as brittle as an RPC system. The best way to 
implement this functionality, (at least the way I do it) is to use a 
redirecting query ie

GET /example.com/somepath/?isbn={isbn}&amp;nuflag={nuflag}

This should return a 302 Redirect who's location header is then the 
real URL, http://example.com/somepath/{isbn}/{nuflag}.

Using redirecting queries is a lot more flexible then 'parameterized' 
URLs since it keeps the full URL-resoultion strategy on the server 
where it belongs. Also, queries are logical constructs which do not 
change while URLs  can change at any time (under heavy load, some 
webservices will migrate resources to another machine). This also 
allows people to throw together quick scripting hacks like Udell's. 

(I would hardly call John's lookup anything other than a hack. It'll 
break as soon as Amazon changes its URLs, something he has no control 
over).

Unfortunately, I really have to disagree Roy on this. There's 
absolutely nothing with human readable resources--in fact they should 
be encouraged--but URI opaqueness is fundamental and very important 
to building flexible systems. The only thing a client should be doing 
to a URL is applying the basic verbs (GET,PUT,POST,etc) to it. It's 
just a locator. Machines aren't as smart as humans.

&gt; Specifically, I am talking about the ability for a URI

Like this:

-- document from http://library.example.foo/lookupService/ --
&lt;form method='GET' action='books'&gt;
&lt;input name='isbn'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

This results in the URI pattern of:
 http://library.example.foo/lookupService/books/?isbn=$value$


 The problem is that nobody knows what 'isbn' means. If we add an attribute
like 'class' or 'type', then Google will be able to tell us all the URI
patterns that support injecting values of a certain type - like ISBN
numbers. Or automobile VINs. Or UPC codes. Or telephone numbers. Or email
addresses. etc.

For example:
&lt;form method='GET' action='books'&gt;
&lt;input name='isbn' class='industry-acceptable-identifier-for-ISBN-concept'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

Of course, I'd like to have a more rich language that specifies not just a
URI, but a full HTTP request - the method, request-uri, headers, content,
etc. Maybe if we added another attribute on &lt;input&gt; as to what the target
is - where to inject the value - then a client could programmatically
generate the appropriate request.

&gt; Yah, I thought long and hard about this recently due to Jon Udell's
&gt; ISBN-in-the-URI javascript hack.  There's no denying the value in that.

There are two aspects to what Jon Udell did that make it work - parsing a
URI and having two services share a common value space.
The sharing a common value space part hasn't been discussed much, but I
think it is an important piece of building network based applications across
organizational boundaries.

In my experience, developers tend to expose internal keys of whatever
database they are using for their application. This is because it makes
sense for the local application and is fast. If you have a URI of
http://localhost/viewstory.jsp?storyId=777 then parsing integers and using
integers for primary keys is fast and keeps the db tables small.
But if you have another 'key' that could possibly be used - like SSN, ISBN,
zip code, etc. - this would help integrate with other systems that also use
or understand those types of values. Storing long textual values as a
primary key might be a practice avoided by db designers, but when looking at
the larger scope of the system (outside a single server or department) it
might bring more benefits. There also might be implementation tricks that
minimize the performance and storage problems of large primary keys.

These are just some rough thoughts I've had for a while &amp; the Library Lookup
bookmarklet makes a great discussion point.

I've recently read about URI and URN in particular. In this homework, I
also stumbled over a few notes entitled "Why HTTP URIs are better than
URNs" on REST Wiki. Right now I can't reach this page (hmm...), and I don't
remember the arguments.

Does it really mean that one should use URL for names as well as addresses?
 Wouldn't it be very confusing if URL gets the meaning of "a web resource,
or possibly a name, who knows?". I like the separation of URL for addresses
and URN for names. The use of meaningless URLs in XML namespaces has shown
to be confusing. From your point of view, is URN a bad/useless technology?

I think you have to be clear about the context before talking about
opaqueness. Are you 'constructing' a URI or 'deconstructing' a URI?
If you are deconstructing a URI, like Jon is doing in his ISBN app
then it is fragile and I agree that the URI should be handled
opaquely.

On the other hand if you are constructing a URI I believe it is
fine to do so. For example search engines do this all the time
when they look for your 'robots.txt' file. Your browser also does it
when it looks for 'favicon.ico'.

I think this depends on whether idempotency is supposed to apply to the 
effect on the resource (ie. a resource state change will occur at most 
once) or the effect on the client (ie. the client sees the same 
response each time). One-time or time-limited URIs seem to be 
consistent with the former, but not the latter.

REST also seems to favour the former interpretation, but, despite some 
heroic attempts by Walden Mathews to shed some light on the issue a few 
months back on this list, it's still unclear what RFC 2616 says about 
it, or even whether RFC 2616 is consistent (IMO, it equivocates between 
the two interpretations).

&gt; 
&gt; Is the idempotency broken with such a concept, if you want to GET such a

From the way you've phrased this, I assume you're concerned about
the "idempotency" property of the GET, above.  GET is "idempotent"
in a trivial way, because it is also "safe" (no side effects).

&gt; 
&gt; This is similar to the earlier question (last year) about Google's 1000 
&gt; hit daily restriction, but I was wondering if anyone could offer their

So, is your concern that the GET on a one-retrieval-only resource is
not safe because it causes a state change?  I think the answer to that
depends on whether the client uses GET intending to unmap the
resource.  If it's purely a server-side effect, then the semantics of GET
are left intact.  That'd be my interpretation, given the info you
presented.

  Should the URI be static or can it be Dynamic too. 
For example if I want to get a object from the

sending in the message.

I'll give my 2c on that indirectly.  It means that all URI are just
identifiers, and can be used as names or locators in different
contexts.

There are two important reasons why I believe this is the case.

1.  A URI that cannot be dereferenced is pretty much useless.
That doesn't mean "answers GET", it means that if you can't interact
with what it identifies, then you don't know, authoritatively, what it
identifies.

2.  Any dereferencable URI will include a string for which an
algorithm exists which will map the string to an IP/port tuple.  That
doesn't mean that the string has anything to do with location.  For
example, the URI http://www.markbaker.ca/ is commonly called a URL
because of the mapping between "http", "www.markbaker.ca", and port 80
on 207.236.3.141.  Yet, if that mapping had been tweaked such that the
URI was foo:markbaker-ca, would people still call that a URL because it
doesn't look like a DNS name, even though the algorithm uses DNS after
some inconsequential syntactical morph?  How is that different than
urn:ietf:...?  I suggest that it isn't.

&gt;  Wouldn't it be very confusing if URL gets the meaning of "a web resource,
&gt; or possibly a name, who knows?". I like the separation of URL for addresses
&gt; and URN for names.

I just like identifiers.

&gt; The use of meaningless URLs in XML namespaces has shown
&gt; to be confusing.

True, but I haven't yet seen that it's caused any interoperability
problems.

&gt; From your point of view, is URN a bad/useless technology?

Pretty much.

From: "John" &lt;buddy1908@...&gt;

The Java HTTP client method of setRequestProperty() is used to set headers -
like Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, User-Agent, etc.
The Java Servlet method of getParameter() is used to get URL query terms for
GET methods and body content for POST methods (where the Content-Type is
'application/x-www-form-urlencoded').
So, you do not use setRequestProperty() in order to have values read by
request.getParameter().

Also, you shouldn't be sending username and password outside of the
Authorization request header - that's what the header is for (unless the
username is not the identifier of the client but some sort of resource
identifier).

You probably also do not want to set doOutput(true) for GET requests.

Your problem is actually getting them.  For headers 
you need to use:

	request.getHeader("attributeName");

Subject:Linking...<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello all,

What are the xml stuffs to link documents? More precisely, how to indicate
in a ressource related ressources, for other actions (where to post, etc.)
for metadata, etc. Here is what i know, but I think there are other
solutions:
    o Link element: in xhtml, rss... one issue is that (as far as I know)
there is no standard values for the rel attribute.
    o xhtml anchors (same problem as link)
    o rdf, with rdf:about
    o xlink: again, the relation type is not clear
    o rddl: work only with xhtml
    o wsdl, wrdl, etc. : links are centralized in a external ressource
    o user define xml element : not standardized
So what kind of link do you use?
One of my problem is to add linking possibility to a xml vocabulary which
don't include it, and that I can't modify.
More precisely, XBEL (bookmarks)  is a hierarchical representation, and i
wan to turn it into a succession of "one-level" ressources, with links to
subressources.

I think PaulP may be able to help - he's a linking guru.

&gt; One of my problem is to add linking possibility to a xml vocabulary which
&gt; don't include it, and that I can't modify.
Can your consumers handle new elements and attributes that are not specified
by the vocabulary?

&gt; More precisely, XBEL (bookmarks)  is a hierarchical representation, and i
&gt; wan to turn it into a succession of "one-level" ressources, with links to
&gt; subressources.
Do you want to maintain the knowledge that some nodes are linked to external
resources, or do you want to accumulate the data into a single
representation?
I suggest maintaining the linking information, so if you modify the
retrieved data, you can serialize it back out to update the corresponding
resource.

Subject:URI fragment identifiers and Topic Map PSIs<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

in the Topic Maps community it is an established praxis to use URIs
that contain fragment identifiers for identifying concepts [1].

Now that I am slowly discovering the principles behind the Web I
realize and understand that this is actually a bad idea [2].

As long is I am absolutely not contrained in the way I create the
URIs I intend to use as names for concepts I see no problem in
using

                 http://www.pets.org/dog

rather than

                 http://www.pets.org/pets.html#dog

to identify the concept 'dog'.


But it will often be the case that one wants to use a parts of a single
document that has been published online to identify concepts. Consider the
concepts 'the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution' and 'the 2nd Amendment
of the US Constitution': it is likely that URIs like

          
          http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am2

will be used as identifiers for them.

I am wondering how to make use of the structure of the document
currently living at http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html and
to adhere to the Web principles at the same time.

Suppose I am the authority that owns http://www.usconstitution.net and
I want to publish names (URIs) for the (concepts of the) amendments of
the US constitution to enable users or semantc web technologies to
make statements about these concepts. Do you think it would be a good
solution to publish URIs such as

          
          http://www.usconstitution.net/constitution/amendments/1
          http://www.usconstitution.net/constitution/amendments/2

and to set up a system on the server that would use const.html and
maybe XSLT transformations to resolve these URIs to representations
that contain the corresponding sections extracted from the large HTML
document?

What about the idea to include links to /const.html#Am1 and /const.html#Am2
in these representations to let humans view the amendment 'in context'?



Within the Topic Maps community the whole issue of fragment identifiers
and URIs that are indended as names isn't yet recognized and we (the community)
are actually promoting this as some sort of 'best practice' or 'this is
how you do it'. (see for example [1]).

I'd really like to come up with a technical solution that enables URI publishing
authorities to use URIs without fragment identifiers but at the same time to
use the internal structure of their documents to return representations that
let humans understand what the published URIs are names for.

Any thoughts about this are very welcome.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Mike,

I'm having problems trying to active the service.  I'm getting a 404 at
http://www.searchalert.net/searchalert/users/activate.jsp. I'm looking
forward to seeing what you have here.

But I actually had a couple of comments and questions:

Comments:

1. Have you considered allowing people to register blog accounts?  The idea
is that you get a story of interest based on a user's subscriptions, dress
the story up in RSS syntax, then POST it to the users registered URL via
RESTLog.

A person's weblog could be getting automatically updated:  InstaBlog.

2. Is there anyway to have the pure XML returned by from Google on your
return mailed to the registered account?

3. If 2 is possible, it would be nice to have a registered XSLT stylesheet
processing instruction glued on the top.

4. Is it possible to register for digest (i.e., newspaper :)) format? Given
enough stories, that match the subscription and a little HTML window 
dressing, each morning there could be a newspaper waiting for you on 
you doorstop (email account.)

Question:

How are you handling Google on your end?  Do you use the SOAP API? How do
you deal with the 1000 hits/day issue?


Thanks,

Jeff

&gt; forward to seeing what you have here.
The server went bonkers the other day (the router is having fits) but it
should be resolved now.
I'll find out what's up with that 404...

&gt;
&gt; But I actually had a couple of comments and questions:
&gt;
&gt; Comments:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Have you considered allowing people to register blog accounts?
Yes. I want to incorporate multiple source types (google web, google news,
blogdex, amazon products, ebay listings, etc.) and multiple destination
types (html mail, xml mail, pager, http POST, etc.).

&gt; The idea is that you get a story of interest based on a user's
subscriptions, dress
&gt; the story up in RSS syntax, then POST it to the users registered URL via
&gt; RESTLog.
&gt;
&gt; A person's weblog could be getting automatically updated:  InstaBlog.
Yeah - I'll take a look at the various blogging apis. I'd probably use
Google news as the source, or actually just provide a checkbox list of
sources and let the user decide. Power to the people, and all that.

&gt;
&gt; 2. Is there anyway to have the pure XML returned by from Google on your
&gt; return mailed to the registered account?
I'm actually doing scraping with regular expressions. The XML from Google
requires a developer ID (which I have) but is limited to 1000 per day.
If you register as an affiliate, I currently provide a template for the mail
notification body - you can make it whatever XML you want. The mail
content-type header still says 'text/html' but I can add a choice for that.

&gt;
&gt; 3. If 2 is possible, it would be nice to have a registered XSLT stylesheet
&gt; processing instruction glued on the top.
You can edit the template to add that if you like.

&gt;
&gt; 4. Is it possible to register for digest (i.e., newspaper :)) format?
&gt; Given enough stories, that match the subscription and a little HTML window
dressing,
&gt; each morning there could be a newspaper waiting for you on you doorstop
(email account.)
Someday... that adds more processing and state &amp; I haven't gone there yet.
Hmm... maybe it's not that hard... add a column for each delivery mode and
set the value based on whether it's been delivered... code another agent...
hmm... time for a new pot of coffee...

I'm in the mode of finding users/customers &amp; then I'll prioritize features.
I'd like the system to get rich and flexible enough to build this newspaper
type system without my code knowing too much about the use it will be put
to.

&gt;
&gt; Question:
&gt;
&gt; How are you handling Google on your end?
&gt; Do you use the SOAP API? How do you deal with the 1000 hits/day issue?
No, I just do an HTTP GET and use regular expressions. Until I want more
metadata I'll keep it at that. When I move to the richer API, I'll have to
talk to Google &amp; do something. I"m hoping to get some users first...

&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
Thank you! Keep the ideas coming.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've been working on a project to create a REST API for working
with the XBEL schema. The XBEL schema is nominally for use with
bookmarks but it has a fairly generic hierarchical representation
that could be used with for other applications, such as weblog
organization and tranformation to RSS. It's at the point where
it can be looked at and commented on. I would welcome any
feedback that people have.

I've tried to follow my understanding of REST as closely as
possible, so any comments with regards to the interface itself
would be greatly appreciated.

I'm giving it the name "Rebel" for, a RE(ST API for X)BEL, not
because there's anything particularly rebellious about it, but
because I couldn't think of anything else that sounded better.
It's currently implemented in Java as a Servlet.

I think there are interesting things that can be done with the
information when it is stored in this way, beyond simply storing
and managing bookmarks.

The details are here: http://www.xefer.com/rebel

quite the same, but the server part is yet very simple (just a dump of a

As i build a full hierarchical tree in a left panel  (explorer-like) i've

try to keep service root URI and the kind of parameters parameters
(bookmarks?folder=123 or bookmarks/folders/123 or bookmarks/123; as my

(human) has to do the job. I'd like to create a serverside configfile (rddl,

&gt; I've been working on a project to create a REST API for working
&gt; with the XBEL schema. The XBEL schema is nominally for use with
&gt; bookmarks but it has a fairly generic hierarchical representation
&gt; that could be used with for other applications, such as weblog
&gt; organization and tranformation to RSS. It's at the point where
&gt; it can be looked at and commented on. I would welcome any
&gt; feedback that people have.
&gt;
&gt; I've tried to follow my understanding of REST as closely as
&gt; possible, so any comments with regards to the interface itself
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; I'm giving it the name "Rebel" for, a RE(ST API for X)BEL, not
&gt; because there's anything particularly rebellious about it, but
&gt; because I couldn't think of anything else that sounded better.
&gt; It's currently implemented in Java as a Servlet.
&gt;
&gt; I think there are interesting things that can be done with the
&gt; information when it is stored in this way, beyond simply storing
&gt; and managing bookmarks.
&gt;
&gt; The details are here: http://www.xefer.com/rebel

&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts about this are very welcome.

I find it useful to think of documents like this as compound documents
where a representation of it is comprised of a representation of other
resources.  In that context, it's pretty obvious that you just need a
means of providing a URI that identifies the resource that some
particular document sub-tree happens to represent, ala;

&lt;a id="Am2" resource="http://www.usconstitution.net/amendment/2"&gt;

I think that "rdf:about" should work in place of "resource", but I don't
know enough about the whole HTML/RDF integration issue to know if there's
any gotchas there (parsetype, etc..).

Often time, the user uses POST to create a new resource. This resource
creation often requires authentication. HTTP authentication, which is
challenge-response, conflicts with this; if the user POSTs a
relatively large resource entity and the server challenges, the entity
is lost. What to do in this scenario? How are others solving this problem?

Lost? Only if the client discards it before reposting with 
authentication.

If it's a problem keeping a large POST entity around during the 
challenge-response you could investigate 100 Continue (see RFC 2616 
8.2.3). The client can add an Accept: 100-continue request header and 
pause before generating and sending the request entity. If the POST is 
authenticated (or no auth is required) the server will respond with a 
100 Continue response and the client can proceed with the request 
entity. OTOH if auth is required the server will respond with a 401 
Unauthorized and client can terminate the request without ever 
generating or sending the request entity.

I believe that server support for 100 Continue is fairly good. 
Unfortunately client support is pretty patchy (I'm pretty sure it's not 
supported by the standard Java HTTP client) but clients with support do 
exist. Not sure what the situation is with proxies tho'.

Cheers,


Miles

First, the only reason you would lose the entity is if the client did not
resend the POST request with the entity in response to the 401.  A few
thoughts come to mind on how to get around the large entity problem (note
that I don't have a feel for the RESTfulness of these ideas):

1) If the URI requires authentication regardless of the verb used, start
with a GET or HEAD to force authentication, returning a 204 (or something
appropriate).  Afterwards, use POST.

2) Variation on #1: have the GET return a unique URI that could be used for
a PUT such that the end result would be the same as a POST that returns the
same URI.

3) Start by POSTing a small placeholder entity.  Once the new URI is
returned, use a PUT to set the resource as you actually want it to be.

I had hope--100 Continue seemed like an elegant solution--but I don't
think it can be used here. Really, the only valid responses of
'Expect: 100-continue' is '417 Expectation Failed' and '100 Continue'.
It can't be used for preauthentication.

Yes it can, that's one of the the things is was designed for.

From 8.2.3,

  The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see section 10.1.1) is to
  allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
  to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
  (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
  body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
  inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
  the message without looking at the body.

Ie. in the absence of an (or an incorrect) Authentication: header it 
would be inappropriate and inefficient for the client to send a 
redundant request entity.

Then later in the same section,

  Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:

      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, an origin server MUST
        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read
        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending
        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue
        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.

Where "final status code" means _any_ response status other than 100 
Continue.

(As you spotted, the request header is Expect: 100-continue, not Allow: 
as I said originally).

Cheers,


Miles

Subject:REST Resource Discovery<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've seen it said on this list and elsewhere that
REST means that a URL is all one needs to know to
interact with a resource.  This sounds appealing,
but I have not seen a document specifying the
conventions necessary to achieve this.

Questions that I think need to be answered:
1. How do you know what MIME-types one may POST or
PUT to a given resource?

My proposal is that servers return accept-POST and
accept-PUT headers in response to GET requests,
however these headers are not actually defined
in any standard so perhaps there is another
approach.  An issue with this approach is that it
implies that it is incorrect to have a resource
to which one is permitted to POST but not GET.
so...

2. Is it permitted to have a resource that exposes
POST but not GET?

3. What is the correct RESTful response to a POST
or PUT?

My feeling is that if one returns a 200 OK, one
should return the result of a GET to that
resource.  Otherwise return 204, or 201 or 303
with the relevant URLs.  Is that correct?

4. How does one achieve transactional semantics
with REST?

Perhaps this is entirely application level.
Create a transaction URL and POST commit to it
when complete.

I would like a solution to this problem also, I think it would help promote
REST oriented applications.
There has been some discussion on this list in the past, here is a summary
of the approaches I've heard:

1 Metadata within response content.
This works for HTML, but isn't suitable for unforgiving content like JPG,
GIF, PDF, MS-Word, schema-bound XML, etc.
For a custom app with your own content types, you could use a &lt;meta&gt; or
&lt;head&gt; element to provide the needed info.
Ideally, the metadata would be available via a HEAD method as well, and this
approach doesn't work with that.

2 Metadata within response headers
This is your proposal, to have something like Accept-POST and Accept-PUT
response headers for GET and HEAD.

3 Metadata in a separate resource known to original resource
3.1 Identified by response content
The content can provide the location of the metadata, rather than the
metadata itself. Same problems as #1 (doesn't work for all content types,
etc.)

3.2 Identified by response header
This would be a header something like Meta-Location and would be availble
via GET or HEAD.
Putting metadata in a separate resource allows for content negotiation to
happen on the description of the resource, so we don't get stuck with not
enough metadata in the headers.

4 Metadata in a separate resource but unknown to original resource
This inverts the problem - you have the URL to a resource definition, but
you don't know what the resources are that it applies to. However, you could
explicitly list those resources, or provide a pattern that matches the URI
of the resources the defintion applies to. If you gather enough descriptions
you probably could do the lookup...

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3 Metadata in a separate resource known to original resource
&gt; &gt; 3.1 Identified by response content
&gt; &gt; The content can provide the location of the metadata, rather than the
&gt; &gt; metadata itself. Same problems as #1 (doesn't work for all content types,
&gt; &gt; etc.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3.2 Identified by response header
&gt; &gt; This would be a header something like Meta-Location and would be availble
&gt; &gt; via GET or HEAD.
&gt; &gt; Putting metadata in a separate resource allows for content negotiation to
&gt; &gt; happen on the description of the resource, so we don't get stuck with not
&gt; &gt; enough metadata in the headers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4 Metadata in a separate resource but unknown to original resource
&gt; &gt; This inverts the problem - you have the URL to a resource definition, but
&gt; &gt; you don't know what the resources are that it applies to. However, you could
&gt; &gt; explicitly list those resources, or provide a pattern that matches the URI
&gt; &gt; of the resources the defintion applies to. If you gather enough descriptions
&gt; &gt; you probably could do the lookup...

FWIW, i have held the same view for some time and concur wholeheartedly.

to take a weblog example, i view the front page of a weblog as a

&gt; In that context, it's pretty obvious that you just need a

&gt; &lt;a id="Am2" resource="http://www.usconstitution.net/amendment/2"&gt;

the place i think this would be most useful (right now at least) is 
referrers (like trackback etc.) on  weblogs.  referrer mechanisms would 
benefit from having a uri such as:

http://blah/weblog/entries/1

rather than

http://blah/weblog

to track back to, regardless of whether the link was followed from the 
weblog front page or the individual entry page.  that way when somebody 
follows the trackback months later and the '5 most recent' front page 
is totally different, only the uri is of the actual entry is relevant 
and hence used.

wouldn't this require user agent support, making it a bitch to 
implement?  or is it just a bad idea.

&gt; I'm curious about the need for these extension headers you propose.  Isn't
that
&gt; what the OPTIONS method is for?  Shouldn't you be able to do an OPTIONS
request
&gt; on the resource itself and have whatever meta information returned?  That
way
&gt; there's no need for two resources with links back to each other.
&gt;
Huh. I thought I looked at OPTIONS and it wasn't appropriate... don't know
what I was thinking. Maybe I was looking only at what methods were
allowed...
This seems like the best approach so far.


Here's the text from the RFC. The only downside is responses are not
cacheable.
====
OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the
communication options available on the request/response chain identified by
the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options
and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a
server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource
retrieval.

Responses to this method are not cacheable.

If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the presence
of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type MUST be
indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification does not
define any use for such a body, future extensions to HTTP might use the
OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the server. A server that does
not support such an extension MAY discard the request body.

If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is intended to
apply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource. Since a
server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the "*"
request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does
nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server.
For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or
lack thereof).

If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies only to
the options that are available when communicating with that resource.

A 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate optional
features implemented by the server and applicable to that resource (e.g.,
Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by this specification. The
response body, if any, SHOULD also include information about the
communication options. The format for such a

body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by future
extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation MAY be used to select the
appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the response
MUST include a Content-Length field with a field-value of "0".

The Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a specific proxy
in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS request on an
absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted, the proxy MUST check
for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards field-value is zero ("0"), the
proxy MUST NOT forward the message; instead, the proxy SHOULD respond with
its own communication options. If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer
greater than zero, the proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards
the request. If no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the
forwarded request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.

Interesting idea.  RFC2616 is incredibly vague
about exactly how you use OPTIONS.  It is so vague
so as to be unusable as is.

That being said, I like the idea of putting the
meta-data in OPTIONS.

Perhaps we can define a convention here about the
headers and body of an OPTIONS response so as to
make interoperability easy.

Here is the information it would be nice for the
server to be able to send:
* Allow: methods
* Content-Types: available via content-negotiation
* Accept-POST: content types
* Accept-PUT: content types
* Accept-PUT-Charset:
* Accept-POST-Charset:
* Accept-PUT-Encoding:
* Accept-POST-Encoding:
* Accept-PUT-Language:
* Accept-POST-Language:
* WWW-GET-Authenticate:
* WWW-POST-Authenticate:
* WWW-PUT-Authenticate:

My strawman proposal is that the server sends a
200 OK with these headers in response to an
OPTIONS request.  Content-Types would have the
same format as Accept.

An alternative for all the method specific headers
would be to use the non method specific versions
of each of these headers with a method=METHOD
parameter.

Thoughts?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST Resource Discovery<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Jeff,

I am not clear on what you are expecting the HTTP OPTIONS method to
return. For example suppose that this is the URL to a Web service
resource that returns a list of parts:

    http://www.parts.com/parts

Now suppose that you do an HTTP OPTIONS to that URL:

    OPTIONS http://www.parts.com/parts

and somehow you specify in the OPTIONS method "give me the service
description".  What do you expect to receive back?  Are you expecting to
receive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS
response?  Let's assume that you do get the service description back as
the payload.  Fine.

But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,
e.g., 

    http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata

How would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?

Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide
metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink
to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your
company wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF
description of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go
off and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here's
your URL:

     http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata

Now you need some way to link your service description back to the parts
service.  That's the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.

To recap, 
- we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate
from the resource it is describing.
- we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,
i.e., distributed resource description
- we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its
(primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is
describing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About
HTTP headers, respectively.
- we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata
resources using standard HTTP GET.

I hope that helps.  /Roger

OPTIONS can report the allowed methods by responding with the correct

Could you not return the link to the service in a "Location" header
on the response?

rfc2616 says:

   The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient
   to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the
   request or identification of a new resource.

It doesn't specifically mention this use of the Location header but
I don't see why it couldn't be overloaded like that. That would
require understanding of course.


Possibly a more RESTy solution is to just provide a link in the
entity returned from the metadata request.



&gt; Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide
&gt; metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink
&gt; to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your

Again, that could use "Location" or a link in the returned

Hmm... When the RFC says the response is not cachable, I am wondering if
they have proxies, etc. in mind.  For the client, it seems that caching
would have to be necessary unless the server could guarantee the metadata in
the OPTIONS response won't change for a certain period of time (which is
effectively caching).  Otherwise, the verb is potentially useless...

WRT this thread, you would do an OPTIONS to a URI and get a response back
indicating the POST/PUTable content-types.  Since there is no guarantee that
the allowable types are going to ba allowable a moment later when you do
your actual POST/PUT, then it follows that it making a decision on the
returned metadata a day later would be little different than making a
decision on it a second later.  At worst case, if the resource's metadata
changed between the time the OPTIONS response came back and the client
submitted a request based on the returned metadata, the server would/should
return the appropriate error.  In turn, this would prompt the client to
request the OPTIONS again and see what has changed...

I guess that's the point of OPTIONS, I don't know exactly what I'd get
back.  If it's a WSDL, there are tools that can parse it directly; if
it's a text description, there's more work to do.  But in any case,
one could ask exactly the same questions about the metadata even if
it were a separate resource.

Granted, OPTIONS is sort of a dark corner of the web right now, but
as metadata becomes more important with the advent of web services,
perhaps it won't be always be.

&gt; But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,
&gt; e.g.,

&gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata

&gt; your URL:
&gt;
&gt;      http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata

Instead of having some third party host the metadata - which will inevitably
get out of synch with the resource who's metadata it is (the
OPTIONS method is explicitly non-cacheable for probably just that reason) -
why not just have a link to the resource itself:

  &lt;a href="http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts"&gt;Car Parts Web Service&lt;/a&gt;

Google would scoop that up even easier.  When you do a search for "Car Parts
Web Service", if enough people have linked to it, it will probably bubble
up to the top anyway.  In either case, you'll be lead to the service itself,
then you request the OPTIONS and away you go.

&gt; Now you need some way to link your service description back to the parts
&gt; service.  That's the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.
&gt;
&gt; To recap,
&gt; - we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate
&gt; from the resource it is describing.

Frankly, I prefer the metadata to be tightly bound to the resource it
is describing.

&gt; - we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,
&gt; i.e., distributed resource description

I think this an interesting point, but I'm not sure that it really matters
so long as you are able to ultimately locate the resource.  Again, it's
fine for others to host the metadata, but they are going to have to be
responsible for keeping it in synch and it might be skipped over by a
normal search engine that's more interested in the text (or the
links in Google's case.)

&gt; - we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its
&gt; (primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is
&gt; describing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About
&gt; HTTP headers, respectively.

Only if you separate them, which granted, is the case today in most
cases.

&gt; - we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata
&gt; resources using standard HTTP GET.

I'm not sure any search engines out there would even parse
and attempt to understand what the metadata even is.  I think my
example above is much more likely to find the service and lead you
to the metadata.

This to me is one of the more insightful statements I've read in
a while:

"On the other hand, I must say that for me in daily life, Google allows
all sorts of useful queries that 5 years ago I thought  would
require the widespread adoption of XML and XML-based format standards
(e.g., for resumes).  Certainly many of the claims/proposals of metadata
advocates 5 years ago look a bit shopworn in hindsight now that we
see how well Google does by ignoring all (most?) metadata other than the
linking patterns." [1]

&gt; I hope that helps.  /Roger

It does.  I think your right on the money with having web service discovery
be a distributed, search-engine based activity as opposed to the UDDI
approach. I just think that current technologies already support this
without
the need to employ extension headers.

According to the spec, yes:

Content negotiation MAY be used to select the appropriate response

I don't have a lot of time, but I'll make a few, quick comments.

1. Consider a movie.  Is it worth seeing?  If Gene Siskel gives it a
"two thumbs up", will you go see it?  Personally, I would like to see a
number of reviews before making my decision.

- Movie review = metadata
- The movie review from Gene Siskel is your "primary movie review".
- Other reviews supplement the primary movie review. 
- To get a complete, more accurate picture, I want an "aggregator" to
show me a composite picture.
- Metadata certainty is an illusion ... The Illusion of Certainty ...

Now translate all these comments into Web services and metadata about
Web services.  See where I am going with this?

2.  Separation of concerns.  Keep metadata decoupled from the resource. 
This enables you to have many different forms of metadata, and also
enables the distributed metadata implied in 1.

Gotta run.  /Roger

&gt; &gt; receive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS
&gt; &gt; response?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's the point of OPTIONS, I don't know exactly what I'd get
&gt; back.  If it's a WSDL, there are tools that can parse it directly; if
&gt; it's a text description, there's more work to do.  But in any case,
&gt; one could ask exactly the same questions about the metadata even if
&gt; it were a separate resource.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, OPTIONS is sort of a dark corner of the web right now, but
&gt; as metadata becomes more important with the advent of web services,
&gt; perhaps it won't be always be.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,
&gt; &gt; e.g.,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide
&gt; &gt; metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink
&gt; &gt; to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your
&gt; &gt; company wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF
&gt; &gt; description of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go
&gt; &gt; off and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here's
&gt; &gt; your URL:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of having some third party host the metadata - which will inevitably
&gt; get out of synch with the resource who's metadata it is (the
&gt; OPTIONS method is explicitly non-cacheable for probably just that reason) -
&gt; why not just have a link to the resource itself:
&gt; 
&gt;   &lt;a href="http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts"&gt;Car Parts Web Service&lt;/a&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Google would scoop that up even easier.  When you do a search for "Car Parts
&gt; Web Service", if enough people have linked to it, it will probably bubble
&gt; up to the top anyway.  In either case, you'll be lead to the service itself,
&gt; then you request the OPTIONS and away you go.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now you need some way to link your service description back to the parts
&gt; &gt; service.  That's the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To recap,
&gt; &gt; - we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate
&gt; &gt; from the resource it is describing.
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly, I prefer the metadata to be tightly bound to the resource it
&gt; is describing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,
&gt; &gt; i.e., distributed resource description
&gt; 
&gt; I think this an interesting point, but I'm not sure that it really matters
&gt; so long as you are able to ultimately locate the resource.  Again, it's
&gt; fine for others to host the metadata, but they are going to have to be
&gt; responsible for keeping it in synch and it might be skipped over by a
&gt; normal search engine that's more interested in the text (or the
&gt; links in Google's case.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its
&gt; &gt; (primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is
&gt; &gt; describing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About
&gt; &gt; HTTP headers, respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Only if you separate them, which granted, is the case today in most
&gt; cases.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata
&gt; &gt; resources using standard HTTP GET.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure any search engines out there would even parse
&gt; and attempt to understand what the metadata even is.  I think my
&gt; example above is much more likely to find the service and lead you
&gt; to the metadata.
&gt; 
&gt; This to me is one of the more insightful statements I've read in
&gt; a while:
&gt; 
&gt; "On the other hand, I must say that for me in daily life, Google allows
&gt; all sorts of useful queries that 5 years ago I thought  would
&gt; require the widespread adoption of XML and XML-based format standards
&gt; (e.g., for resumes).  Certainly many of the claims/proposals of metadata
&gt; advocates 5 years ago look a bit shopworn in hindsight now that we
&gt; see how well Google does by ignoring all (most?) metadata other than the
&gt; linking patterns." [1]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope that helps.  /Roger
&gt; 
&gt; It does.  I think your right on the money with having web service discovery
&gt; be a distributed, search-engine based activity as opposed to the UDDI
&gt; approach. I just think that current technologies already support this
&gt; without
&gt; the need to employ extension headers.

I think we are mixing two very separate concepts
of metadata.

One type of metadata describes the what or why of
a resource.  This class of metadata is encompassed
by reviews and ratings and handled by search
engines, RDF, and many other systems that go way
beyond the scope of discussion on REST.  It is
entirely dissociable from the resource being
described.

The other type of metadata describes HOW to use
the resource.  For REST, this HOW information is
basically the content-types one may GET PUT or
POST. (Other protocols have more complex
documentation requirements).

I put a strawman proposal on the table for the
later a few days ago.  Is it satisfactory?  Is it
inadequate?  Does someone have a better idea?

Or do people here think these issues are really
inseparable and want to mix them?

Subject:OPTIONS response (was Re: [rest-discuss] REST Resource Discovery)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>From: "S. Alexander Jacobson" &lt;alex@...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps we can define a convention here about the
&gt; headers and body of an OPTIONS response so as to
&gt; make interoperability easy.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the information it would be nice for the
&gt; server to be able to send:
&gt; * Allow: methods
&gt; * Content-Types: available via content-negotiation
&gt; * Accept-POST: content types
&gt; * Accept-PUT: content types
&gt; * Accept-PUT-Charset:
&gt; * Accept-POST-Charset:
&gt; * Accept-PUT-Encoding:
&gt; * Accept-POST-Encoding:
&gt; * Accept-PUT-Language:
&gt; * Accept-POST-Language:
&gt; * WWW-GET-Authenticate:
&gt; * WWW-POST-Authenticate:
&gt; * WWW-PUT-Authenticate:

I suggest a slightly different format:

verb request-header:value

where:

verb: GET, PUT, POST, etc., and "*" which means any verb (for which the
following request-header is allowed)
request-header: these are headers that it recognizes (e.g. content-type,
user-agent, etc.)
value: indicates an allowable value (following the same rules for the actual
request-header).

Any combination that is not explicitly defined means that the resource
doesn't care about those headers.

So, suppose you encountered a response like:

PUT content-type:text/html
* content-type: application/xml+rss
GET user-agent:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)


In this case, this is saying that PUT only allows a content-type of
text/html or application/xml+rss, while all other verbs (in this case POST)
allow only application/xml+rss.  Also, the resource is only GETable by IE6
(or a client that says it's IE6).  Note that no other combination is defined
for user-agent, so it implies that any client can issue a POST, PUT, etc.

It might even do to extend this format slightly to allow the server to
explicitly indicate that it understands a given header name, thereby
allowing new clients to query a server to see if the server can handle the
added features of the client.  I'm not sure how this format would be.  Maybe
just leave the value out of the above string.  Are there any existing
headers where an empty string is a valid value?  If so, we could possibly
leave the colon off.  For instance, suppose there was a new request header
called "my-feature".  The server could return:

* my-feature:  (or without the colon)

to indicate that it knows about this field and handles it according to
whatever semantics it has.

For some forms of metadata, you want the authoritative source to be the
resource itself - like what the allowed programmatic interactions are. Other
metadata, like making claims 'about' the resource (asserting that it is a
member of some topic/subject/concept/etc.) benefits from being external and
having multiple sources to varying trust.

&gt; I think we are mixing two very separate concepts
&gt; of metadata.

I believe that you are missing my point.  Let me quote David Jacobs:

"Metadata about a web service goes beyond a WSDL file, XML Schemas and a
tmodel description.

A web service may have
* a WSDL file
* an HTML description
* XML schema's it returns and accepts
* a DAML-S description
* a reliability rating
* a usefulness rating
* how it can be integrated with other services

Furthermore, while a service provider will often produce a lot of 
service metadata to facilitate its use, they cannot be seen as
objective 
parties when contributing metadata to be used in matchmaking (i.e., is 
this the service I need).  Clearly there is a role for third parties to
add their own metadata about a service in the form of ratings and new 
metadata formats which might increase the service's usefulness for a 
population segment."

My point is that a HOW metadata document is just a small part of the
metadata that you will associate with web service.  Further, even of the
HOW metadata there will be many, many different formats - XHTML, WSDL,
RDF, DAML-S, OWL, etc.  To top it off, all of the many metadata
documents will be distributed across the Web [just like all of the Web
sites that link to your Web page are distributed across the Web].

Bottom line: for a Web service there will be many (many) metadata
documents, spread across the Web.  The key is to provide a "general
mechanism" for associating a metadata document with a web service. 
That's what Meta-Location buys you.  /Roger

<pre>Hi Mike,

&gt; For some forms of metadata, you want the authoritative source to be the
&gt; resource itself - like what the allowed programmatic interactions are.

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a Web service should
have an "authoritative service description".  I agree!  The
Meta-Location header provides the URL to the service's authoritative
service description.

&gt; Other
&gt; metadata, like making claims 'about' the resource (asserting that it is a
&gt; member of some topic/subject/concept/etc.) benefits from being external and
&gt; having multiple sources to varying trust.

It's more than that. Suppose that my shop is running RDF engines to
enable inductive reasoning, and suppose that the Web service that my
company wants to use just provides an XHTML description.  Thus, my
company creates an RDF description of the Web service - it tells the HOW
of how the use it, and it does it using RDF.  Thus, my company's RDF
description adds value to the Web service, and it does it in a
distributed fashion. /Roger

The only thing I'd like to see in it that is

Content-Types: &lt;same format as accept&gt;
Encodings: &lt;same format as accept-encodings&gt;

Regarding the options header on GET, I like that

I'd like to avoid a proliferation of file formats

&gt; &gt; In this case, this is saying that PUT only allows a content-type of
&gt; &gt; text/html or application/xml+rss, while all other verbs (in this case
&gt; POST)
&gt; &gt; allow only application/xml+rss.  Also, the resource is only GETable by IE6
&gt; &gt; (or a client that says it's IE6).  Note that no other combination is
&gt; defined
&gt; &gt; for user-agent, so it implies that any client can issue a POST, PUT, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It might even do to extend this format slightly to allow the server to
&gt; &gt; explicitly indicate that it understands a given header name, thereby
&gt; &gt; allowing new clients to query a server to see if the server can handle the
&gt; &gt; added features of the client.  I'm not sure how this format would be.
&gt; Maybe
&gt; &gt; just leave the value out of the above string.  Are there any existing
&gt; &gt; headers where an empty string is a valid value?  If so, we could possibly
&gt; &gt; leave the colon off.  For instance, suppose there was a new request header
&gt; &gt; called "my-feature".  The server could return:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * my-feature:  (or without the colon)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; to indicate that it knows about this field and handles it according to

<pre>Sorry, what I meant was that if there was some concern
that since OPTIONS can't be cached and it would be possible
that the metadata could be out of date by the time you
actually went to use the service, one possible way to deal
with that is to redirect the OPTIONS call using a a 303,
which changes the call into a GET which could be made cachable.
An Expires: timestamp would indicate how long that metadata is
gauranteed not to change.

	&gt; Huh. I thought I looked at OPTIONS and it wasn't
appropriate... don't know
	&gt; what I was thinking. Maybe I was looking only at what methods
were
	&gt; allowed...
	&gt; This seems like the best approach so far.
	&gt;
	&gt;
	&gt; Here's the text from the RFC. The only downside is responses
are not
	&gt; cacheable.
	&gt;
	&gt; [deleted]
	&gt;
	
	Hmm... When the RFC says the response is not cachable, I am
wondering if
	they have proxies, etc. in mind.  For the client, it seems that
caching
	would have to be necessary unless the server could guarantee the
metadata in
	the OPTIONS response won't change for a certain period of time
(which is
	effectively caching).  Otherwise, the verb is potentially
useless...
	
	WRT this thread, you would do an OPTIONS to a URI and get a
response back
	indicating the POST/PUTable content-types.  Since there is no
guarantee that
	the allowable types are going to ba allowable a moment later
when you do
	your actual POST/PUT, then it follows that it making a decision
on the
	returned metadata a day later would be little different than
making a
	decision on it a second later.  At worst case, if the resource's
metadata
	changed between the time the OPTIONS response came back and the
client
	submitted a request based on the returned metadata, the server
would/should
	return the appropriate error.  In turn, this would prompt the
client to
	request the OPTIONS again and see what has changed...

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt;&gt; For some forms of metadata, you want the authoritative source to be
the
&gt;&gt; resource itself - like what the allowed programmatic interactions
are.

&gt; If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a Web service
should
&gt; have an "authoritative service description".  I agree!  The
&gt; Meta-Location header provides the URL to the service's authoritative
&gt; service description.

Instead of introducing a new header for this, couldn't you just stick 
with the standard OPTIONS method? If you have one authoritative bit of 
metadata that you want to keep in a separate document, respond with 
a "303 See Other"; and if there are multiple documents, that could turn 
around an respond with either Content-Type specific documents, and/or
for
finer grained control, a "300 Multiple Choices."

Since any tool that would be looking for a custom header would need to
be written with that in mind, it would be just as easy for it to 
call the OPTIONS method and deal with the results appropriately.

&gt;&gt; Other
&gt;&gt; metadata, like making claims 'about' the resource (asserting that it
is a
&gt;&gt; member of some topic/subject/concept/etc.) benefits from being
external and
&gt;&gt; having multiple sources to varying trust.
&gt;
&gt; It's more than that. Suppose that my shop is running RDF engines to
&gt; enable inductive reasoning, and suppose that the Web service that my
&gt; company wants to use just provides an XHTML description.  Thus, my
&gt; company creates an RDF description of the Web service - it tells the
HOW
&gt; of how the use it, and it does it using RDF.  Thus, my company's RDF
&gt; description adds value to the Web service, and it does it in a
&gt; distributed fashion. /Roger

If a time comes when search engines are able to parse and understand
semantically marked up documents, wouldn't it be easier to just have
a link to the service right in the document itself instead of
introducing
a custom header?  Google is all about looking a links already.

Your already talking about introducing custom header formats, and 
OPTIONS methods can contain an entity body. Perhaps a better way 
of dealing with this is to include a message body in the OPTIONS
request that is just the method you're interested in:

	&lt;method&gt;PUT&lt;/method&gt;

(Make it XML just to be fancy :)).  The response could then be 
a standard set of headers and/or metadata about just that method.

A OPTIONS call without the &lt;method/&gt; entity could respond with 
the information that a &lt;method/&gt; element is require for OPTIONS
calls to that service.

I like your version of the format quite a lot.
The only thing I'd like to see in it that is
missing is some way of finding out what
content-types are available via
content-negotiation.

Content-Types: &lt;same format as accept&gt;
Encodings: &lt;same format as accept-encodings&gt;

Regarding the options header on GET, I like that
as a concept, but the practice makes me nervous.
I'd like to avoid a proliferation of file formats

I'm not sure that's necessary, though.  A client should submit to the server

What value would it be for a client to get back a list of content-types that

I don't understand your concern here.  As it is OPTIONS is woefully

nicely (at least for some uses).  Regardless of the suggested header, anyone
could return any response-entity of any content-type for OPTIONS right now.
There is no way we can avoid that.  What the header does is allow a resource
to indicate that metadata is available via OPTIONS in certain formats.  This
is more an ability to actively inform the client of OPTIONS abilities than
it is a method of proliferating multiple content-types when using OPTIONS.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I agree.  You could certainly just send the "Accept" header.  But this
requires you to have to initiate a call to OPTIONS just to see if there is a
content-type you can handle (i.e. get a valid response or an error).  The
advantage of the options header is that it allows a resource to actively
inform the client of those content-types that it can return.  This can avoid
additional roundtrips to the server.  Also, since OPTIONS does not seem to
be used all that much right now, this is a simple way to start telling
clients that OPTIONS *is* being used for a given resource.  The lack of the
header is not an indication that OPTIONS is available for the resource
(which is no different than things are now).  But an explicit statement of
OPTIONS can have advantages.  Wrt the Google example I gave earlier, they
would not have to make two requests to every resource when only a very small
percentage (e.g. &lt; .0000001%) would return a useful response to the OPTIONS
request.

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that's necessary, though.  A client should submit to the
server
&gt; &gt; the list of content-types that it understands (i.e. "Accept" header) and
the
&gt; &gt; server should choose from that list or return an appropriate error
response.
&gt; &gt; What value would it be for a client to get back a list of content-types
that
&gt; &gt; it didn't understand?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Further, I should point out that the format I suggest does allow a
server to
&gt; &gt; return something like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; GET accept: text/html, text/*, */*
&gt; &gt; GET accept-encoding: compress, gzip
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically, just about any request header could be specified.  The
example in
&gt; &gt; my original post were just a sampling for demonstration and not the
complete
&gt; &gt; list of possibilities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the options header on GET, I like that
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a concept, but the practice makes me nervous.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to avoid a proliferation of file formats
&gt; &gt; &gt; for this sort of thing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't understand your concern here.  As it is OPTIONS is woefully
&gt; &gt; underutilized.  It makes sense that in this emerging world of new
metadata
&gt; &gt; constructs, esp. wrt web services, the OPTIONS feature could fit the
bill
&gt; &gt; nicely (at least for some uses).  Regardless of the suggested header,
anyone
&gt; &gt; could return any response-entity of any content-type for OPTIONS right
now.
&gt; &gt; There is no way we can avoid that.  What the header does is allow a
resource
&gt; &gt; to indicate that metadata is available via OPTIONS in certain formats.
This
&gt; &gt; is more an ability to actively inform the client of OPTIONS abilities
than
&gt; &gt; it is a method of proliferating multiple content-types when using
OPTIONS.

It is only non-cacheable by default.  Use cache-control to change that.

The Web had a notion of external links, but nobody could agree on the
HTTP syntax so it didn't make the cut.  WebDAV added properties.

Adding a new header field to every GET response would increase latency
for no benefit to the common case and only marginal benefit to the
applications being discussed.  It is therefore more efficient to have
the client request that information only when it is desired.

<pre>Ahh!  That all makes sense.  However, I don't know that I would agree that
the added header would increase latency since it would be an optional
header.  The only time it would be given is if there is reason to give it,
which would also be when it's more likely to be needed.  It wouldn't make
sense using the header for the vast majority of resources out there.  But
for newer resources, it may be a helpful hint at a minimal cost...

On the other hand, it would be one less header to have to deal with...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a Web service
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; have an "authoritative service description".  I agree!  The
&gt; &gt; Meta-Location header provides the URL to the service's authoritative
&gt; &gt; service description.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of introducing a new header for this, couldn't you just stick
&gt; with the standard OPTIONS method? If you have one authoritative bit of
&gt; metadata that you want to keep in a separate document, respond with
&gt; a "303 See Other"; and if there are multiple documents, that could turn
&gt; around an respond with either Content-Type specific documents, and/or
&gt; for
&gt; finer grained control, a "300 Multiple Choices."

"standard OPTIONS method"?  There is no such thing.  Don't be under the
illusion that you are using something "that already exists".  You are
redefining/adding-to the semantics of the OPTIONS method, i.e., there is
no server in the world that understands OPTIONS &lt;url&gt; means it should
return the metadata document for a service.   

To recap:

* Yes, the OPTIONS verb is a viable alternative to the using the 
Meta-Location header.  There are pluses and minuses to each approach.
*  However, you still need the Meta-About header to solve the problem
of allowing third parties to add metadata about a resource (see below).
 
&gt; If a time comes when search engines are able to parse and understand
&gt; semantically marked up documents, wouldn't it be easier to just have
&gt; a link to the service right in the document itself instead of
&gt; introducing
&gt; a custom header?  

"link to the service right in the document itself" ... You mean mandate
that every metadata description document must contain  buried within it
a URL to the service it describes?  Consequently, tools must delve into
(and understand the semantics of) the metadata description document to
extract the URL, right?  For example, an aggregator tool which, say,
wants to collect together the URLs of all metadata descriptions which
refer to some vendor's service must parse through every metadata
description document to extract the URL.  Yikes!  Not very RESTful is
it?  This would be analogous to forcing caching tools to examine (and
understand) the contents of every message to decide whether it should
cache the message.  No, this Meta-About URL needs to be in the HTTP
header.  /Roger

P.S. RDF engines that do inductive/deductive reasoning are already here.

Roger,

&gt; "standard OPTIONS method"?  There is no such thing.  Don't be under
the
&gt; illusion that you are using something "that already exists".  You are
&gt; redefining/adding-to the semantics of the OPTIONS method, i.e., there
is
&gt; no server in the world that understands OPTIONS &lt;url&gt; means it should
&gt; return the metadata document for a service.    

I completely agree that very, very few, if any, are using OPTIONS in 
this way currently; but the same could be said of the headers you
are proposing that others support.  Returning an Allow header
along with a set of schemas, or even a link, or a redirect to 
a set of schemas is a perfectly valid and appropriate use of OPTIONS.

I wouldn't say that it is adding to the semantics of the OPTIONS 
method any more than adding an extension header is adding to a GET.
A client is requesting what their options are at that location
and the server is informing them.

What I am saying is that instead of proposing the inclusion of a 
new header with each GET, it might better to propose the
adoption of the convension of using the OPTIONS method.  I don't 
have a problem with a standalone document, but I would like to see 
the OPTIONS method be the mechanism for getting to it.  

&gt; To recap:
&gt;
&gt; * Yes, the OPTIONS verb is a viable alternative to the using the 
&gt; Meta-Location header.  There are pluses and minuses to each approach.
&gt; *  However, you still need the Meta-About header to solve the problem

&gt;&gt; a link to the service right in the document itself instead of
&gt;&gt; introducing
&gt;&gt; a custom header?  

&gt; "link to the service right in the document itself" ... You mean
mandate
&gt; that every metadata description document must contain  buried within
it
&gt; a URL to the service it describes?  Consequently, tools must delve
into
&gt; (and understand the semantics of) the metadata description document to
&gt; extract the URL, right?  

To be honest, I am much more ambivalent about how 3rd-party metadata 
documents refering back to the service.

Google has no idea of the meaning of the documents it is parsing, it
just
indexes the words and pulls URLs out of link tags. Granted, if
some metadata decides to put links into the document in some way that it
doesn't understand (like the soapAction attribute etc.) then it's either
going to miss them; have to start looking for a wider range of
standardize linking
mechanisms (xlink, etc.); or get a lot smarter about the way it parses
document.

&gt; For example, an aggregator tool which, say,
&gt; wants to collect together the URLs of all metadata descriptions which
&gt; refer to some vendor's service must parse through every metadata
&gt; description document to extract the URL.  Yikes!  Not very RESTful is
&gt; it?  

I'm not sure how this is RESTful or non-RESTful.  If a client requests 
a document, it's up to the client to do whatever it sees fit with it.

&gt; This would be analogous to forcing caching tools to examine (and
&gt; understand) the contents of every message to decide whether it should
&gt; cache the message.  No, this Meta-About URL needs to be in the HTTP
&gt; header.  /Roger

Unless the OPTIONS method of the metadata (the meta-metadata of the
service) service included a link to the service that's being 
described. :) If you're pouring over what you know to be metadata 
documents anyway, you could always hit that resource with an OPTIONS
request while your at it.

This has been an interesting discussion.

Roy,

I noticed in your WAKA ApacheCon presentation that you discuss the
ability to include metadata about the resource and representation along
with the response.  Could that assume the form of a link to another
document?  Either way would be the moral equivalent of what Roger is
proposing it seems to me.

Would there be any equivalent of the OPTIONS method?  Or is that sort of
functionality deprecated?

RFC2616 mentions that and further specification of OPTIONS is left for
future versions of HTTP. Is there any work currently underway to further
refine that method?

Thanks,

Yes, it includes external links with role attributes.  It also allows
metadata to be interleaved with the response data, thus removing the
issue regarding overhead latency.

&gt; Would there be any equivalent of the OPTIONS method?  Or is that sort 
&gt; of
&gt; functionality deprecated?

Yes.  At least one form of OPTIONS request was always intended to
contain the desired (later) request in the OPTIONS body (excluding the
body of the desired request itself), thus allowing the server to know
exactly what options should be described.  It couldn't be standardized
because I didn't have time to implement it, and without that nobody
else was willing to implement.

&gt; RFC2616 mentions that and further specification of OPTIONS is left for

Always.  No implementations yet, though.

Subject:Pseudo code and UML and REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
My believe is that if you follow the "Network is not a LAN" and the
"REST is incompatible with 'end-point' RPC" arguments, then you
will also agree that pseudo code and UML are inappropriate for
designing REST applications.

With respect to pseudo code, if you have control structures, then
you have state, most likely state that is carried on the server,
which is un-REST-ful.

With respect to UML, if your design talks about objects and the
methods exposed by objects and the attributes of objects and
objects as containers and so on, then you will end up with an RPC
style design and creating objects on the server and calling methods
on those objects etc, which is un-REST-ful.

Can anyone give me any additional bullets to use in this argument? 
I believe that these arguments could be used not just against
SOAP/XMLRPC development strategies, but also against the design
strategies and CASE tools that might be used with them.

Or, have you got any reasons why this thinking is wrong headed?

Comments?

<pre>Yes.  I was underscoring the tendency for discussion communities
to oversimplify models, leading to the assumption that if one is
talking about idempotence in methods, then one must be talking
about REST.  It's another example of lumping HTTP and REST
into a single lump.  As one learns these patterns, it takes continued
effort and review to keep the lumps from bleeding together.

yes.  i believe xforms will allow you to send put/delete, paul prescod 
mentioned this a while back.

with html forms, you can use both approaches.

with javascript on the client, you can use an XmlHttpRequest object (at 
least i think thats what its called; *weird* name, why not just 
'HttpRequest'?) to send a PUT or DELETE.

because i prefer to avoid client scripting, i prefer to use an 
intermediary on the server which 'pre-processes' the request body.  
approaches i have used include sending the put/delete flag in a hidden 
form field, or using the value of a submit form field.  (i didn't 
widely test browser behaviour with submit field values.)  this then 
forms the basis of an ifThenElse/switch structure which you can use to 
call either PUT or DELETE code.

HTML 4.01 defines (S17.3) "get" and "post" as the only valid values for
the method attribute of the form tag. The browsers don't recognise it
because there is no valid way to construct a PUT or DELETE form in HTML.

<pre>Dave,

I read it quickly.  While there's much value in viewing a web
application as a distributed state machine, I'm not sure how far
that model needs to be carried into the implementation.  For
instance, how much about the FSM is the client expected to
understand in order to use the service?  This is a sensitive area,
because if the full FSM model is required on the client side,
then you lose the "low cost of entry" attribute, and make it
harder for the server application to evolve.

If, on the other hand, the server has embodied within it the
notion of an FSM of valid client states, and the client is able
to explore that (changing) state space dynamically, then you
have something cool.

I agree with you here.  Sigh.  I guess, that means that there is
good bit of work to do.

In my examples, the current state is returned to the client (in the
XML document returned as content).  So, all the client needs to do
is return the content (or the current state from the XML content)
along with some additional input, which the FSM uses to select the
next transition/state.

However, while that's likely true for trivial examples like mine,
for real world, complex problems, I'm sure that clients cannot fly
blind, so to speak.  Client developers will have to understand the
FSM and the BP (business process) that is behind it.

So, I'm agreeing with you.  There are things that can be done to
help, for example, provide a description of the BP, provide an XML
specification of the BP, describe the mapping from the BP to the
FSM (or to an XML document that describes the FSM), provide
documentation on the FSM, provide an XML document that describes
the FSM (along with tools to inspect it), etc.

OK.  Talk's cheap.  I'd better get to work.

&gt; 
&gt; If, on the other hand, the server has embodied within it the
&gt; notion of an FSM of valid client states, and the client is able
&gt; to explore that (changing) state space dynamically, then you
&gt; have something cool.

This is a bit mysterious to me.  By "explore the state space", do
you mean that the client can find out what states (nodes) are in
the FSM and which are connected to which?  If so, I'd agree that
the client needs access to this information (a picture of the
entire FSM), one way or another.

However, the client developer should also be able to take a
"peep-hole" view.  For example, "I'm in state X, so all I have to
do is provide this input (e.g. a user ID)." Or, "If I'm in state X
and I provide a valid user ID, what happens?"

Think of it this way -- Suppose we have an FSM that analyzes a
stream of characters.  All the client should be required to do is
to continually feed the next character.  For more complex
processes, all that should be required of the client is to feed the
next piece of input (e.g. a user ID and password, a part number,
etc).  Granted that the developer of the client application would
have to understand the BP/FSM in order to know what information to
provide.  However, I can imagine a server implementation (the FSM)
that provides a description of the next required piece of input
with each response.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST and FSM and processes<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; In my examples, the current state is returned to the client (in the
&gt; XML document returned as content).  So, all the client needs to do
&gt; is return the content (or the current state from the XML content)
&gt; along with some additional input, which the FSM uses to select the
&gt; next transition/state.

I think the way it typically works is that the "current" state
is represented by the data returned from the last request, and
that the embedded links in that (arbitrarily many, according to the
transition set of your FSM) are invitations for the client to
transition to the next state.  Does that make sense?

&gt; 
&gt; However, while that's likely true for trivial examples like mine,
&gt; for real world, complex problems, I'm sure that clients cannot fly
&gt; blind, so to speak.  Client developers will have to understand the
&gt; FSM and the BP (business process) that is behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I'm agreeing with you.  There are things that can be done to
&gt; help, for example, provide a description of the BP, provide an XML
&gt; specification of the BP, describe the mapping from the BP to the
&gt; FSM (or to an XML document that describes the FSM), provide
&gt; documentation on the FSM, provide an XML document that describes
&gt; the FSM (along with tools to inspect it), etc.

Now you're talking about "choreography", which is not what
I meant at all.  I meant something like the opposite, that "clients
can fly blind" in the sense that you can accomplish something
(you and your code) without having a representation of the
application's FSM in front of you.

&gt; 
&gt; This is a bit mysterious to me.  By "explore the state space", do
&gt; you mean that the client can find out what states (nodes) are in
&gt; the FSM and which are connected to which?  If so, I'd agree that
&gt; the client needs access to this information (a picture of the
&gt; entire FSM), one way or another.

Yes to the first part; no to the second.  Why wouldn't the
client be able to "explore" state space, and having so done,
draw its own map of that space as an FSM or whatever?

&gt; 
&gt; However, the client developer should also be able to take a
&gt; "peep-hole" view.  For example, "I'm in state X, so all I have to
&gt; do is provide this input (e.g. a user ID)." Or, "If I'm in state X
&gt; and I provide a valid user ID, what happens?"

Are you missing the role that URIs embedded in representations
play in this?

&gt; 
&gt; Think of it this way -- Suppose we have an FSM that analyzes a
&gt; stream of characters.  All the client should be required to do is
&gt; to continually feed the next character.  For more complex
&gt; processes, all that should be required of the client is to feed the
&gt; next piece of input (e.g. a user ID and password, a part number,
&gt; etc).  Granted that the developer of the client application would
&gt; have to understand the BP/FSM in order to know what information to
&gt; provide.  However, I can imagine a server implementation (the FSM)
&gt; that provides a description of the next required piece of input
&gt; with each response.

That's how it should work.  "Hypertext as the engine of application
state" and all that.

&gt; I'd like to hear others thoughts on this.

Hmm... well, I am curious to see what will be in part 2 of the blog.  As for
this entry, I feel that some of the observations are either over-simplified
or plain wrong.  It's hard to agree with all of the blogger's conclusions
when it's based on somewhat flimsy arguments.

However, I do agree with the basic theme of the blog.  Using URIs and
documents to form a digital identity makes more sense than going the MS
Passport way.  At one level this is a description of the Web itself.  I have
a URI (http://www.seairth.com) which identifies documents which start to
give a rough idea of who I am.  This is true also for
http://www.microsoft.com and http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/.


Also, for those who are not aware of it, Thawte as the Web of Trust[1],
which is a a bottom-up certificate authority (CA) system.  Using SSL and the
WOT, a certain portion of this bottom-up REST-oriented digital identity
problem could be solved.  I'm not saying this is the solution to all of the
problems, just that there *are* others out there already attacking the
problem in a similar manner.

<pre>Hey - I just found out there was a note back in 1999 about using HTML forms
to do authentication.
I haven't read it fully, but this is one of my pet peeves with HTTP and the
'visual Web' - no visibility of security information in messages. (leading
to sessions, cookies, wacky urls, etc.)

===
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/NOTE-authentform-19990203

[...]
This proposal suggests extensions to HTML forms to overcome their present
security problems by integrating them with HTTP (or other security sublayer)
mechanisms. It calls for a new type of form; the AUTHFORM and new values for
the TYPE attribute of the INPUT element and SELECT block.

Subject:ANN: Generating REST-ful Quixote applications<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have continued to explore the possibility of supporting FSMs
(finite state machines) and workflows with REST-ful applications. 

In order to do so I've implemented several simple source code
generator which produces REST-ful Quixote applications that
implement an FSM or workflow.  These code generators read an XML
document that describes the FSM/workflow, its states, and its
transitions.  It generates the skeleton of a Quixote application.
And, I've written a document about it, with attached support code
and examples.

You can find this document at:

The attached example files contain code that is from Juan David
Ibez Palomar.  Thanks Juan David.

Subject:Re: REST Resource Discovery<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Why not access all of the various functionality of a service by 
specifying different ACCEPT values on the request?  So, if I want the 
service's response in XML for programmatic access, I would specify 
ACCEPT: text/xml.  Or, if I want the UI for user access, I would 
specify text/html.  To get the schema, I could specify 
application/xsd+xml.  To get the interface def, I could specify 
application/kinda-like-wsdl-for-rest+xml.  Sure, some necessary MIME 
types don't exist, but isn't that a fault of MIME and not HTTP?  
After all, if XML can get its own MIME type even though its really 
just text, why stop there?

Okay, so we'd end up with billions of MIME types for everyone's 
different schemas.  But since XSD is so core, it really should have 
its own MIME type.  Perhaps one more new MIME type is needed: 
application/metadata+xml, which when requested would return an index 
of all various metadata of the service, such as scaler values like 
author and version, and links (different URLs) to complex metadata, 
such as reviews of the service.  Of course, these different URLs 
could themselves be services, which can be accessed programatically 
(via ACCEPT: text/xml) or by a user (via ACCEPT: text/html).  The 
reviews could even have reviews.

&gt; 
&gt; I believe that you are missing my point.  Let me quote David Jacobs:
&gt; 
&gt; "Metadata about a web service goes beyond a WSDL file, XML Schemas 
and a
&gt; tmodel description.
&gt; 
&gt; A web service may have
&gt; * a WSDL file
&gt; * an HTML description
&gt; * XML schema's it returns and accepts
&gt; * a DAML-S description
&gt; * a reliability rating
&gt; * a usefulness rating
&gt; * how it can be integrated with other services
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, while a service provider will often produce a lot of 
&gt; service metadata to facilitate its use, they cannot be seen as
&gt; objective 
&gt; parties when contributing metadata to be used in matchmaking (i.e., 
is 
&gt; this the service I need).  Clearly there is a role for third 
parties to
&gt; add their own metadata about a service in the form of ratings and 
new 
&gt; metadata formats which might increase the service's usefulness for 
a 
&gt; population segment."
&gt; 
&gt; My point is that a HOW metadata document is just a small part of the
&gt; metadata that you will associate with web service.  Further, even 
of the
&gt; HOW metadata there will be many, many different formats - XHTML, 
WSDL,
&gt; RDF, DAML-S, OWL, etc.  To top it off, all of the many metadata
&gt; documents will be distributed across the Web [just like all of the 
Web
&gt; sites that link to your Web page are distributed across the Web].
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line: for a Web service there will be many (many) metadata
&gt; documents, spread across the Web.  The key is to provide a "general
&gt; mechanism" for associating a metadata document with a web service. 
&gt; That's what Meta-Location buys you.  /Roger

<pre>There must be a way to get to a service's metadata given only the service's URI.  To require modifying the URI to get the metadata could modify the service, or even select a different service.  So, given only the service's URL, you can either hit the service, and discard all the response except some header like MetaData-URI: /some-resource/metadata, which would seem an unnecessarily wasteful invocation of the service just to get that URI.  Or, you can pass some parameter in the request (as a header) specifying that you don't want to invoke the service, but only want to get its metadata (or, as you suggest, a reference to the metadata).

I can't think of any other way to get to the metadata given only the service's URI and without altering it.

In other words, OPTIONS seems to be for obtaining more communications-centric metadata, while HEAD seems to be for obtaining more content-centric metadata.

// see: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.4

How about evaluating these approaches against a specific, theoretical scenario?  Suppose we have a service that supplies weather reports given a specific location.  Clients can currently specify the location by zip code or city+state, although it will soon support latitude+longitude too.  The service can provide the response weather report as either text/html, application/xhtml+xml, text/vnd.wap.wml, text/xml, and even image/gif...the client need only specify which it wants via ACCEPT.  The service has a name, description, version, author, and links to reviews.  The reviews are in fact other services provided by Amazon, epinions, etc. that can be accessed both programmatically and interactively.  The service currently supports the USA and Canada, but will soon support much of Western Europe too.

Now I, a user, want to find out about this service.  How do I do it, given only a URL a friend sent me of http://host.domain.tld/services/free/?svc=weather&amp;zip=98005

Good question. :)

People have been considering mechanisms for binding
metadata to a resource.  HTTP Extensions for Resource 
Metadata (HERM) [1] looks to be a good solution.  It
calls for the use of a pair of headers, Meta-Location
and Meta-About.

We've been considering some potential refinements. I
felt that the OPTIONS method would be the natural place
to return the Meta-Location in the general case, which
is similar to the use of the Allow header.  It's unclear
though if this is stretching the semantics of OPTIONS 
too far.  I'd like to know if it is.

Roy Fielding had mentioned in a posting to 
this list that adding an extra header to each GET is not
optimal [2], but that might be the easiest road to 
adoption.

Other interesting ideas have been floated on the HERM 
associated discussion list [3].



This topic is essentially one aspect of the TAG issue 
"metadataInURI-31" [4] specifically with regards to 
this comment:

    "... and more importantly there should be a "clean", 
    uniform way to refer to (and thus access) the metadata 
    of web resources..."

Another potential issue brought up by Berners-Lee in 
a recent posting [5] to www-tag concerns a similar issue: how
can site level "metadata" such as /favicons, p3p statements
etc., be bound to a site in a standard way.  It would seem 
that the solution to the first issue could form the basis 
of the solution to the second issue.

Hello All,

I don't really want to bring the dreaded 'What do URIs identify?'
debate which consumes the tag-list every once and a while to this

RDF into a REST based system. I've written up my thoughts about the

<pre>I think you might consider adding a disclaimer, much like this mail, to
the front of the paer, saying that "these are your thoughts."

For example, Roy Fielding defines "resource" as follows:

&lt;quote&gt;
The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information
that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal
service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other
resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other
words, any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext
reference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a
conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds
to the mapping at any particular point in time
&lt;/quote&gt;

However, you write:

&lt;quote&gt;
Let's quickly go over some of the basics of REST.

A resource is an Object that exists on a network.
&lt;/quote&gt;

So apparently your views and Roy Fielding's are quite different.

Question:

By my understanding of REST, the whole purpose of URIs is to provide a means
of addressing a resource which is then available via the various HTTP verbs.
If so, then why *isn't* it just as easy to say "A resource is an Object that
exists on a network"?

While I will concede the "network" point, since URIs can point to local
resources, what good is a URI which points to nothing (ex: the various "urn"
schemes) since it is not available via the HTTP verbs, and therefore is an
island unto itself, creating exactly the problem REST opposes? I know this
behavior is expressed in the very concept of URIs and is used extensively in
RDF, but from what I gathered REST deals specifically with HTTP and
therefore it deals with, well, objects (resources) on a network.

A URI, even an HTTP URI, that cannot be dereferenced nonetheless

Yes, believe me I do get that point. :)

Maybe I can re-phrase this somehow...

REST is an architectural style for referencing resources across HTTP, right?
So then, what good does "urn:i-am-foo" do me when I can't (a) GET it, (b)
POST to it, (c) PUT it, or (d) DELETE it? How do these URIs fit into the

Or are we talking about two different things? I can see their use in RDF (as
mentioned in the original e-mail) as unique identifiers, but not as a
REST/HTTP resource itself.

Hmm... Maybe I'm missing something here?

I know the problem I'm trying to solve is this: given a set of of HTTP

&gt;
Well, many namespace names are URIs.  While there is some (much) debate, 
I think many don't expect to dereference a namespace name.

There seems to be a desire on some people's part to be able to say that 
if a URI uses a scheme that is dereferencable, the you must be able to 
dereference the URI.  Or conversely, if I have a name that I don't want 
to be dereferenced, then I shouldn't use a URI with a dereferencable 
scheme.  Personally, I don't understand the problem - a name is a name. 
 Some will dereference, other will not.

&gt;  
&gt;
This is another one I don't really understand (the general case, not 
your specific problem).  How do you determine what is metadata and what 
is data?  (One person's metadata is another's data).  Why isnt a chunk 
of metadata for a resource just another resource?  And does it really 
make sense to only allow the owner of a resource to provide metadata for 
that resource.  To me, the question of how do I find metadata for a 
resource sounds a lot like 'how do i find out what resources point to 
this resource?'

Subject:RE: [rest-discuss] Re: Integrating RDF and REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'll preface this by saying I'm a REST newbie, so please be gentle... :)

&gt;There seems to be a desire on some people's part to be able to say that 
&gt;if a URI uses a scheme that is dereferencable, the you must be able to 
&gt;dereference the URI.  Or conversely, if I have a name that I don't want 
&gt;to be dereferenced, then I shouldn't use a URI with a dereferencable 
&gt;scheme.  Personally, I don't understand the problem - a name is a name. 
&gt; Some will dereference, other will not.

And this goes to the heart of my problem with this approach: one of the
fundamental ideas behind REST is that a URL is transferrable from one medium
to the next, and no matter where you find it you know (a) it's a URL and (b)
you can use the HTTP verbs against it.

OK, maybe I should qualify that by saying "HTTP URLs" -- maybe that will
clear this up a bit, since URLs don't have to have just an HTTP scheme.

Now, having clarified it as HTTP URLs, let's ask the question again: Why
would I ever want a URL *which specifies an HTTP scheme* to never be
dereferenced? It seems to fly in the face of the philosophy that, given a
URL, I can at least GET it and probably use the other verbs as well. In
other words, it seems very REST-less.

I can see a use for non-dereferencable (is that a word?) URI/Ls (even those
specifying an HTTP scheme), i.e. as unique names in RDF and such, but why
would I ever need such constructs under REST?

&gt;Why isnt a chunk 
&gt;of metadata for a resource just another resource?

But if it's a resource, then mustn't it be available under REST? Maybe I'm
barking up the wrong tree here, if so please let me know so I can get it
right.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;There seems to be a desire on some people's part to be able to say that 
&gt;&gt;if a URI uses a scheme that is dereferencable, the you must be able to 
&gt;&gt;dereference the URI.  Or conversely, if I have a name that I don't want 
&gt;&gt;to be dereferenced, then I shouldn't use a URI with a dereferencable 
&gt;&gt;scheme.  Personally, I don't understand the problem - a name is a name. 
&gt;&gt;Some will dereference, other will not.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And this goes to the heart of my problem with this approach: one of the
&gt;fundamental ideas behind REST is that a URL is transferrable from one medium
&gt;to the next, and no matter where you find it you know (a) it's a URL and (b)
&gt;you can use the HTTP verbs against it.
&gt;  
&gt;
I think you have some terminology confused here.  REST as an 
architectural style has no concept of URI/URLs; it only talks about 
identifiers.   The 'fundamental idea' you talk of above is related to 
the Web, not REST.  

When we say that the web is an implementation of REST, dont make the 
mistake of thinking of the relationship between REST and the Web as one 
of superclass/subclass.  The Web is not a subclass of REST.  The Web can 
be classified as a RESTful (more or less) application - just like some 
other application might be classified as a client-server application.

&gt;OK, maybe I should qualify that by saying "HTTP URLs" -- maybe that will
&gt;clear this up a bit, since URLs don't have to have just an HTTP scheme.
&gt;
&gt;Now, having clarified it as HTTP URLs, let's ask the question again: Why
&gt;would I ever want a URL *which specifies an HTTP scheme* to never be
&gt;dereferenced? 
&gt;
You're not the only one to ask that question.  There's been a lot of 
debate on this in the W3C TAG and other places. See the thread that 
starts at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Oct/0118.html 
for just one instance of this discussion

Personally, I have no problem using URIs as simple identifiers 
(dereferencable or not).  A name is a name.  Names exist outside of the 
Web and outside of REST.  The URI spec provides a nice set of rules for 
the syntax to use when constructing names.  Since part of the name is 
the scheme, I'd just as soon use an existing scheme rather than invent 
yet another scheme.  And if I'm going to use an existing scheme, I'll 
stick with http.  

&gt;It seems to fly in the face of the philosophy that, given a
&gt;URL, I can at least GET it and probably use the other verbs as well. In
&gt;other words, it seems very REST-less.
&gt;
There's nothing stopping you from trying to GET any http URI you want 
to.  Note, however, the web makes no guarantee that the GET operation 
will actually succeed.  And don't forget, some resources may only 
respond to a POST. Or you may have a URI for a resource that doesnt 
exist anymore or that hasnt been created yet.  So even if you presume 
that http URIs are meant to be dereferenced, there's nothing in the 
architecture of the Web that guarantees that you'll get anything useful 
when you do so.

&gt;I can see a use for non-dereferencable (is that a word?) URI/Ls (even those
&gt;specifying an HTTP scheme), i.e. as unique names in RDF and such, but why
&gt;would I ever need such constructs under REST?
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Why isnt a chunk 
&gt;&gt;of metadata for a resource just another resource?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;But if it's a resource, then mustn't it be available under REST? Maybe I'm
&gt;barking up the wrong tree here, if so please let me know so I can get it
&gt;right.
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm not sure what you're asking here.  I was just pointing out that I 
don't see a need to try to create two different worlds - one for 
resources and one for metadata.  It seems to me that metadata about some 
resource is itself a resource, so why cant we just handle metadata the 
same way we handle any other resource.

Technically, HTTP supports requests against non 'http' URI.

== getting ldap entries ==
GET ldap:ou=org;dn=my.friend HTTP/1.0
Host: directory.anywhere.net
User-Agent: http-aware-phone/v1.0


== making a phone call ===
GET tel:425-555-1212 HTTP/1.0
Host: dial.anywhere.net
User-Agent: http-aware-phone/v1.0


But I might just be smoking high-grade crack here...

Chuck, 

You really cleared things up for me. I was running into this exact problem
in my argument, assuming that REST was tied to the web environment. So it
appears REST could be used in virtually any architecture that (a) supported
strong, unique names for resources, and (b) exposed a limited, common set of
functions on those resources? "Database" immediately springs to mind, and of
course that is an example I've seen given to show how REST works in the
abstract.

Anyway, thanks for opening my eyes -- it's definitely a learning curve, but
a fun one. :)

Thanks,
-dave

Subject:FYI- Web services authentication takes leap forward<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre> From InternetNews.com [1] :

"The OASIS standards consortium Tuesday took another leap forward toward
securing Web services with the ratification of Extensible Access Control
Markup Language 1.0 (XACML) [2] as an OASIS Open Standard.
XACML is a security standard which allows developers to write and enforce
information access policies, making it a key component in the development of
authorization infrastructures and a foundational step in the creation of
federated authentication environments....

Sun Microsystems followed up on XACML's approval Tuesday with the release of
its implementation of the standard under an open source license. [3]"

On first glance this looks promising for securing REST web services as well
as the other sort :-)

Ideally, I'd like to describe the allowed format of request entities, but

Subject:Generating client user interfaces for REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've been continuing my exploration of exposing complex processes
and business process across the Web in a REST style on top of
Quixote.

I'm now able to generate crude graphical user interfaces from an
FSM (finite state machine) that describes a complex process.

How it's done -- A two step process:

  1. From an FSM XML document, generate a .wxg file.  The FSM XML
    document contains specifications of the input items needed at
    each state to select the next transition.  A .wxg file is an
    XML document that contains the definition of a GUI (the
    graphical user interface) and is loadable by wxGlade. wxGlade
    is a GUI design tool for wxPython.

  2. Load the .wxg file into wxGlade, do a bit of editing and
    re-arranging, then select the File/Generate Code menu item to
    generate Python code.

Why you might care about this:

  1. Suppose that you have implemented a BP (business process) as a
    REST-ful FSM server application (using the tools described at
    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/workflow_howto.html or in some
    other way).  Now you want to implement client applications that
    talk to your server application.  And, further more, suppose
    that this client application needs to present a user interface
    to an end user so that the end user can enter information items
    needed by the FSM (e.g. in order to determine which transition
    to take).  Obviously, Python is your first choice for
    implementing these clients and wxPython is a good platform for
    the GUI.  This GUI generating capability is a good way to
    substantially reduce the amount of work needed to produce those
    user interfaces.

  2. Suppose you have implemented a Web service (a REST-ful one, of
    course). Now you want to encourage others out on the Net
    somewhere to implement clients for your service.  By giving
    them help in the implementation of a client user interface, at
    least that part of the user interface that enables human
    end-users to enter data, you have made their work easier.

You can find more information about this capability and how to use
it at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/workflow_howto.html

Look for the section "How to Generate a Client GUI".

The code that does the work is in fsmappgen.py which is in the
example code linked to by this document and can be found at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/workflow_examples.zip

Please let me know if you have corrections or suggestiongs for
improvements.

And, I'm looking for useful ways to apply this technology.  Let me
know if you have ideas about that.

  - Dave

Subject:apache configuration for REST and pseudo-URL's<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>okay, this has to be a FAQ, and i'm embarrassed to ask it, BUT :P

i'm new to REST but would like to give it a shot as a way of solving
some problems for multiple web servers having access to centralized
data in my university..

i'd like to configure our apache server for REST -- i.e., set up a
url-dispatcher to handle all urls on my site under a certain directory
(or pseudo-directory), so that i can dispatch the requests to a
handler..  and i can't seem to figure out how to do it without the
actual file *existing*.. i get Error 404 - Object not found! error
messages.

i've played with the SetHandler and Action apache directives, putting
them in a &lt;Location&gt; such as:

   &lt;Location /test &gt;
     Action url-dispatch /cgi-bin/handler.pl
     SetHandler url-dispatch
   &lt;/Location&gt;

what i want is for any URL request for, say, 

   http://my.server.com/test/departments
   http://my.server.com/test/departments/engineering
   http://my.server.com/test/faculty
   http://my.server.com/test/faculty/tbsmith
   http://my.server.com/test/departments/engineering/workingpapers/jan2003

   etc., etc.

the above urls to all go to the same handler.. which then parses it
and sends it to the correct sub-script, etc.. i don't want to have to
actually have the test directory (or subdirectories) exist.

i have been through the apache docs a ba-zillion times, and looked
through newsgroups, forums, etc etc etc.. looked here and on pauls
REST pages and the REST wiki.. spent time with altavista/google, even
scoured computer shelves at barnes &amp; noble.. but i can't seem to
figure out how to do this.. 

i don't want to have to go through the trouble of setting up re-write
rules (using mod-rewrite).. but is that what people generally do?

or is the SetHandler/Action way the easier way, but i'm just missing
something? .. what am i doing wrong?

alternatively, is there a tutorial / directions on this somewhere?

finally, what word/term/jargon does one even *use* to refer to this
phenomenon or technique? i've looked stuff up under "dispatcher", or
"URL", or "cgi" or "script", or even with specific apache terms like
"SetHandler".. but is there generally a name for this "technique" so
that i can even know how to refer to it or how to look for it?

i'm ashamed to ask such a basic question, but i would be very grateful
if anyone could point me in the right direction..

thanks.

That's what I do, for example on http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/ .
Perhaps there are other ways to do this that I'm not familiar with

Currently, I am using 404, following the argument that the entire URI, not

It would only make sense to do this if the other

For example, 'name=socrates' and 'name=socrates&amp;mortal=yes'
shold work, but 'name=socrates&amp;mortal=no' should
return 404.

There is something funny about FALSE being equal
to NotFound, but I'm not sure what it is.

&gt; to NotFound, but I'm not sure what it is.

It's still the authors choice how to handle this. Just like is procedural
languages where some use null to indicate things, as compared to holding a
boolean value.

Subject:Supporting DELETE/PUT via web browser<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello All,

I'm looking for information regarding support for DELETE/PUT via a
standard web browser. Browsing through the archive it seems you need a
kludge to do that.

1. If so, what technique is preferable? Hidden field? URL rewriting?
2. Do browsers support it after all??

Thanks for any pointer.

Mozilla supports is through the XMLHttpRequest object.

correct.

&gt; 1. If so, what technique is preferable? Hidden field? URL rewriting?

if you mean rewriting to include the method, as in ?method=foo then 
that is NOT preferable because it results in a GET with side-effects; 
GETs are supposed to be idempotent.

frequently, POST and PUT are not applicable to the same resource (at 
least in my experience), so you can overload POST to do what you want.  
i pre-process such POST requests on the server (this is arguably an 
intermediary in REST nomenclature) to call PUT code instead.

delete can be done with a hidden (or submit) form field.

&gt; 2. Do browsers support it after all??

only via XMLHttpRequest.

I've used 404 myself, but I could think of good reasons not to.

If there was some set of query params that identified the "primary

ignored such that GET returned the same representations as for the
URI with only the primary key params specified.  In theory, it may be
useful to return a 302 response back to this primary URI; in practice,
it's certainly not worth the extra round trip, so probably fine to
just return the same representations on a 200 until new parameters
are supported.

If you expect your primary key may change, then a 404 approach
probably makes good sense.

That's just my first thoughts on the subject.  It's a pretty
interesting question though; a real mental-model stress test.

Hmm... I suppose you could also just return a Content-Location: header with
the 200 response.  On the other hand, this effectively allows others to
extend the URL with your implicit permission.  For instance, suppose someone
chose to add their own query parameter which they used in their own system
for some reason or other.  Now, suppose at a later point in time, you decide
to add a new query parameter to your system which just happens to be the
same name as someone else's parameter name.  Potentially, you could cause
unexpected side effects for that link that's already out there.  Admittedly,
it's unlikely that this scenario would happen, but there's a lot about the
web today that I would have said the same thing about yesterday.

&gt; If you expect your primary key may change, then a 404 approach
&gt; probably makes good sense.

In this case, I do not have the pk in the query string.  I have just
finished writing a new blog system (didn't like any of the ones I found),
trying to use the REST architecture as much as possible.  I still have a
long way to go, but the first version is up and running(?) at
http://www.seairth.com/blog. In this case, the query string is only used to
fetch html-based forms for adding/editing folders and entries.  For
instance, suppose I have an folder whose URL is:

http://www.seairth.com/blog/blogg

(yes, it actually exists)  If you do a GET on that URL, you will get back an
appropriate representation of the resource.  Now, if I wanted to create a
new subfolder or entry, I would POST the appropriate message to that URL.
This could be done by writing a gui application similar to what Joe Gregorio
has done with his blog system.  However, since I don't have ony yet, I opted
to use html-based forms.  In order to fetch the appropriate form, I would
use a URL like:

http://www.seairth.com/blog/blogg?form=addentry

(yes, it exists, but is protected)  This would return to me an html form,
which would in turn just POST to the URL (without the query string).  At the
end of the day, it all works really, really well.  So far, anyhow.  :)

&gt; Hey - I just found out there was a note back in 1999 about using HTML forms

&gt; I haven't read it fully, but this is one of my pet peeves with HTTP and the

&gt; This proposal suggests extensions to HTML forms to overcome their present

&gt; the TYPE attribute of the INPUT element and SELECT block.
&gt; [...]

I've been thinking about this as well. I'm due to give an
evangelizing talk about REST for a client and I know that this is
going to come up.

My experience of HTTP authentication is that the fixed user interface 
makes it unpopular with users (or at least website designers) and that
has a knock on effect on the architecture of web services components
built as part of the same application.


It seems the ideas put forward in the link above were not
popular. Adding stuff to HTML doesn't seem like the right thing to do
anyway.

I've always wondered why an authentication response couldn't have an
entity associated with it, either in the response body or referenced
via some content-location like header.

If it were possible to associate an entity with the authentication
then browsers could render it when they find it and use the standard
dialog box when they don't.

Would that sort of scheme violate REST principles in anyway?

I think the biggest problem with HTTP Authentication is that no web
browser has a 'logout' function and the worst thing about this is
that if you type the wrong password you then have to close your
browser before trying again.

It's a long time since I dealt with basic auth... but I thought it was
possible to send the UNAUTHORIZED response to log the user out and
then have the user log in again with another username and password.

The problem with that is again the crappy UI. If the browser always
displayed the entity "facilitating" the authentication (ie: the entity
in the UNAUTHORIZED response) then the user could have a clear logout
that worked as they expect it to.


Does that make sense?

In my experience it doesn't work like that :-(

Personally I do things like adding a . to the domain name to fool
the browser into letting me have another go but this is not an
answer.

It certainly can work like that, provided you build the part needed
on the server.  But it's a logout followed immediately by another
login, which I'm not sure is the requirement here.

That's right. If you've ever shown a user an app that works like that
you'll not have quickly forgotten the look of disgust you get  /8-&gt;


My point about the entity body was that if the UA aways preferred the
display of the entity over popping up it's own dialog then it woiuld
be easy to present a nice UI with basic auth.

The trouble is I guess, that javascript would be needed to send the
basic auth request because there's no syntax in HTML to do it (which
is what kicked this thread off).

Actually, 401 can have an entity in the response[1].  Unfortunately, it's

In truth, the dialog box bothers me less and less.  I think the browser
makers could dress it up a bit, making it look more like a feature of the
browser instead of a out-of-place dumpy dialog box.

As for the 'logout' bit, I think this gets back to some of the theories
behind REST itself.  My understanding is that 401 allows you to
*authenticate*, not *log in*.  "Logging in" implies maintaining some form of
server-side session state, which is a big REST no-no (at least as I
understand it).  In this view, it makes sense that there would not be a
corresponding "logout" ability.  I think that treating 401 as "login"
instead of "authentication" has been one of it's biggest barriers to it
being more widely accepted.  I have to admit that I had the same
issues/problems early on.  However, now that I have the correct mindset, I
find it to be the correct way to go.

It seems to me that if you have a RESTful application that you are
demonstrating (i.e. no server-side session state), when someone asked "how
do you log on?", you could say something like "You don't need to log on or
log off.  That's the old way of doing things.  Now, you only have to
authenticate yourself. That's it."  Sure, you might get a few people asking
"what's the difference?", but this would give you the opportunity to
enlighten them.  :)

I think, if I understand this discussion, what's wanted is a protocol
between user and UA, in which login session does exist, such that
the UA knows when to stop sending the credentials to the server.
That would constitute a logout.  There's certainly nothing wrong with
maintaining a session between user and UI, is there?  Otherwise,
the user has to type credentials over and over, which is no good.

Oops, sorry :-(

I still don't understand how after sending a 401 you can get a web
browser to re-prompt the user for the username and password? I've
never managed to achieve this.

I don't think that's true, the exact means by which users authenticate
will always need to be under application control because clients like
it that way. I don't know many websites that use basic auth now, but
ones that offer "login" forms abound, and not just for non-techies.

Even from a webservices perspective my suggested change to the 401
behaviour looks useful: a server might want to supply to a client a
page describing the authentication system to be used. Maybe a user
token can be obtained from an ldap server somewhere, or something
like that.


&gt; As for the 'logout' bit, I think this gets back to some of the theories
&gt; behind REST itself.  My understanding is that 401 allows you to
&gt; *authenticate*, not *log in*.  "Logging in" implies maintaining some form of
&gt; server-side session state, which is a big REST no-no (at least as I
&gt; understand it).  In this view, it makes sense that there would not be a
&gt; corresponding "logout" ability.

It depends what you mean by "login" doesn't it  /8-&gt;

Does REST really require that there be no server maintained state at
all? I thought the problem was how the association between server and
client is done: if it's done RESTfully (one way would be by
authentication) then it's ok isn't it?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>From: "Walden Mathews" &lt;waldenm@...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think, if I understand this discussion, what's wanted is a protocol
&gt; between user and UA, in which login session does exist, such that
&gt; the UA knows when to stop sending the credentials to the server.
&gt; That would constitute a logout.  There's certainly nothing wrong with
&gt; maintaining a session between user and UI, is there?  Otherwise,
&gt; the user has to type credentials over and over, which is no good.

But the user *does* have to type credentials over and over.  Fortunately,
the browser is doing the work for him.  Why would a RESTful application care
whether the user was "logged in" or "logged out"?  All the server should
care about is that the user is authorized.

Now, I do understand the security risk(s) here.  Until the browser is closed
or the server sends another 401 for the same realm, that browser (or
whatever agent) basically has the security clearance of the user.  Since
there is no guarantee that the same user will be using that instance of the
browser, there is the possibility for someone else to get into the system
with the wrong credentials.  However, I do not believe this is a problem for
the server to solve.  Instead, I think it's important to improve the client.

Here are some suggestions:

1) When a browser is sending authentication with each request, prominantly
provide a button on the screen labeled "clear authentication" (or some
such).  A user can click on this at any time to force the browser to dump
the authentication.

2) When the user leaves the authenticated page/realm, have the browser
prompt the user as to whether the authentication information should be
cleared or not.  This way, a user does not have to depend on #1 above or on
closing the browser in order to go to another website.

3) Just as you would expect for gaining access to other everyday items,
require the user to authenticate himself to the browser via biometrics, an
access card, etc.  In other words, the user-to-browser credentials should
leave with the user and cause the browser-to-server credentials to be
cleared immediately.

Again, I think the "logout"/security problem is not with the server.  We
should not be solving it at the server.  The weakness is with the
browser/user-agent and that's where it should be fixed. imho, of course.

<pre>I'm not sure there was consesus on this.  As I recall, this issue came down
to whether the end state of a DELETE is what's important or the state change
itself.  If the state change is important, then returning a 404 would
indicate that there was no state change (since the resource did not exist).
On the other hand, if the end state was important, then returning a 200 (or
204) would always be used whether the resource existed at the time of the
request or not, since the end state would be the same either way.
Personally, I'd say it depends on the requirements of the application...

I'm sorry if I'm being really think but I still don't understand,
'logout' and 'login' are _both_ 401's? 

How is a 'logout' 401 different from a 'login' 401?

Appearently, IE6 (SP1) has added the ability to dump the cache.  Here is a
bit of javascript I wrote to do it:

&lt;a href="javascript:void
document.execCommand('ClearAuthenticationCache',false, null)"&gt;Clear
Authentication&lt;/a&gt;

Even more interesting is that I added this link to my Favorites/Links (which
I show as a toolbar) and now have a way to clear my authentication cache any
time I want to.  It would be nice for MS to have made this available in
general, but it's neat to have found it anyway.

For those of you who want a logout (at least when IE6 SP1 is used), you
could extend this to clear the cache, then GET a "thanks for using us" page,
or whatever...

Subject:Containers and nested representations<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've been working through a few issues related to how a container 
resource behaves, and I'm not sure if I'm bumping into some limitations 
of REST or HTTP.

Imagine I have two kinds of resource, boxes and widgets. All wigets are 
contained in boxes. So, to examine a given box I can

GET /box/100 HTTP/1.1

and the response is

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
   &lt;box-id&gt;100&lt;/box-id&gt;
   &lt;colour&gt;Blue&lt;/colour&gt;
   &lt;widget x:href="/widget/33"&gt;
     &lt;widget_id&gt;33&lt;widget_id&gt;
     &lt;colour&gt;Green&lt;/colour&gt;
     &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
   &lt;/widget&gt;
   &lt;widget x:href="/widget/34"&gt;
     &lt;widget_id&gt;34&lt;widget_id&gt;
     &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
     &lt;size&gt;10&lt;/size&gt;
   &lt;/widget&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;

The idea here is that the contained resources are serialised in the 
representation. I'm assuming that this is OK from a REST perspective.

Now I want to modify a box. I'm going to use PUT to replace the whole 
box. In doing this I'll naturally be replacing the contained widgets as 
well.

PUT /box/100 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;box&gt;
   &lt;box-id&gt;100&lt;/box-id&gt;
   &lt;colour&gt;Green&lt;/colour&gt;
   &lt;widget&gt;
     &lt;widget_id&gt;33&lt;widget_id&gt;
     &lt;colour&gt;Blue&lt;/colour&gt;
     &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
   &lt;/widget&gt;
   &lt;widget&gt;
     &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
     &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
     &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
   &lt;/widget&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;

The response is

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

Now, I've changed the colour of this box, and I've both changed the 
colour of widget 33, and added a new widget 35 to the container. Also I 
have deleted widget 34, since it now had no container, and this is not 
allowed (in this particular application).

My question is, have I done too much at once here? I'd like to be able 
to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, but 
the response I must return relates to the container, not its contents. 
Also I'm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be 
happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request, but 
this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside 
the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.

No... 401 is authentication challenge. Whenever the UA recieves an
authentication challenge it should respond with whatever auth details
it has got.

That may be the subject of your confusion. Some caching somewhere?
I'm a hippy so I never use IE and may not have experienced some cache
induced problem with authentication.

My confusion is how people set things up on the server side so that
after a client has, by mistake, typed the wrong passwd, and
submitted it they can be re-prompted for a username and passwd
again.

In my experience the only way to get a new prompt for a username and
passwd is to shut the browser and start again.

Perhaps, I generally run everything through squid.

&gt; I'm a hippy so I never use IE and may not have experienced some

I only know mozilla on Linux well and I usually have it set to use a
1k cache and to refresh everything every time...

It's very curious this. I've _never_ had this problem, not even with
commercial software. I'm using moz on linux as well, before that I
used mainly navigator 4.x

When my basic auth apps want to log someone out they send a 401 even
when the user is already passing in a WWW-Authenticate header.

The behaviour I see, and what I think is correct, is the browser
popping up the window again.


When I find time I'll construct and easily replicatable test for this
and send it to you. It might be interesting to get to the bottom of
the problem.

Thanks for sharing this; I've been a bit complacent in posting my 
experiences with containers to this list.

&gt; [snip example]

&gt; The idea here is that the contained resources are serialised in the

Maybe this could be a 200 with the updated box/100?  The 204 just seems 
kind of 'useless' to me.

&gt; Now, I've changed the colour of this box, and I've both changed the
&gt; colour of widget 33, and added a new widget 35 to the container. Also I
&gt; have deleted widget 34, since it now had no container, and this is not
&gt; allowed (in this particular application).

Hmm.. I'm not sure that having widget 34 automatically 'fall off a 
cliff' is a good thing.

It may be helpful to consider the fact that 'widgets can not have no 
container' a constraint specific to your application, and try and find 
a strategy that is RESTful to enforce it.

Idea:
Perhaps you should explore the concept of a 'reaper' process (a client 
UA or something on the server) which periodically searches and destroys 
orphaned widgets (it could use explicit DELETE requests to do this on 
the results of a GET /widgets?parent=null or whatever).

But see below.

&gt; My question is, have I done too much at once here? I'd like to be able
&gt; to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, 
&gt; but
&gt; the response I must return relates to the container, not its contents.
&gt; Also I'm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be
&gt; happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request, but
&gt; this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside
&gt; the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.

I have asked the same question (aloud, not on the list).  I think its 
something of a grey area.

Rather than a big fat PUT to the container, you could split your 
request up in to a number of constituent requests to constituent 
resources.  for example:

1. PUT to widget/33 changing the colour.  this would (or should?) 
update box/100 automatically because it has a dependency on widget/33.
2. POST widget/35's URI to box/100 (possible after POSTing 35 to 
widgets).
3. DELETE 34.
    or
    PUT box/100 minus the mention of widget/34.

the trouble with the delete of 34 is that the semantics are overloaded. 
  the PUT to the box that excludes the 34 really only removes it from 
the container, rather than deleting it outright.  these are two 
seperate semantic actions.

i would be interested to hear what you (and others) think of this.

D.J. Adams has written about this same idea at
http://www.pipetree.com/space/RtRest (warning this is cutnpaste from 
the HTML):

--CUT
Having something like /ticket/42/basics/status returning a 
representation of ticket 42's status in text/plain, say "new", is a 
very attractive feature, I think.

GET /ticket/42/basics/status HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: Close
Content-Type: text/plain

open

Preferable to composing a method call, serialising it into XML, sending 
  it to an end point, and then parsing the result out of the XML that 
comes back, all to retrieve such a simple piece of data. It's 
intriguing.
--CUT

anyway, thanks again for the thought-provoking post, and the coherent 
example (works wonders when trying to ask a question!).

-vincent

&gt;&gt; My question is, have I done too much at once here? 

It depends entirely on the nature of the application.  There is
nothing wrong with resources containing other resources and updating
them all at once, as this is probably more efficient in many
circumstances.

But you're right, this may result in the silent creation of resources
that you haven't explicity given URIs.

This is the same mechanism I am using in an application that I've 
described here:

  http://www.xefer.com/rebel/rebel.html

I'm using &lt;folder&gt; and &lt;bookmark&gt; but the idea is the same.

&gt;&gt; I'd like to be able
&gt;&gt; to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, 
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; the response I must return relates to the container, not its
contents.
&gt;&gt; Also I'm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be
&gt;&gt; happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request,
but
&gt;&gt; this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside
&gt;&gt; the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.

&gt;&gt; Rather than a big fat PUT to the container, you could split your 
&gt;&gt; request up in to a number of constituent requests to constituent 
&gt;&gt; resources.  for example:

&gt; 1. PUT to widget/33 changing the colour.  this would (or should?) 
&gt; update box/100 automatically because it has a dependency on widget/33.
&gt; 2. POST widget/35's URI to box/100 (possible after POSTing 35 to 
&gt; widgets).
&gt; 3. DELETE 34.
&gt;    or
&gt;    PUT box/100 minus the mention of widget/34.

I chose to support both the cource-grained PUT and the finer-grained
methods
on each of the "contained" resources in the exact manner you've
described
here.

&gt; the trouble with the delete of 34 is that the semantics are
overloaded. 
&gt;  the PUT to the box that excludes the 34 really only removes it from 
&gt; the container, rather than deleting it outright.  these are two 
&gt; seperate semantic actions. 

This would depend on the underlying datamodel of course and is entirely
up to the application.  If a &lt;widget&gt; can exist as a standalone entity
then you would probably be forced to implement the operation as a
"remove"
and force a "delete" to be done with a DELETE on the widget resource
itself.

That would be great :-)

Here is my test, using a site I have been working on, that anyone
can signup for an account on (on the http interface):

  https://www.helpisathand.gov.uk/

  Username: foo 
  Password: bar

You then get an 401 and after you have this I have never been able
to get a new prompt for a uesername passords pair.

You can always generate single-use or secret URLs

What are the actual use-cases for HTTP-auth?

&gt; &gt; Hey - I just found out there was a note back in 1999 about using HTML forms
&gt; &gt; to do authentication.
&gt; &gt; I haven't read it fully, but this is one of my pet peeves with HTTP and the
&gt; &gt; 'visual Web' - no visibility of security information in messages. (leading
&gt; &gt; to sessions, cookies, wacky urls, etc.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ===
&gt; &gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/NOTE-authentform-19990203
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; This proposal suggests extensions to HTML forms to overcome their present
&gt; &gt; security problems by integrating them with HTTP (or other security sublayer)
&gt; &gt; mechanisms. It calls for a new type of form; the AUTHFORM and new values for
&gt; &gt; the TYPE attribute of the INPUT element and SELECT block.
&gt; &gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about this as well. I'm due to give an
&gt; evangelizing talk about REST for a client and I know that this is
&gt; going to come up.
&gt;
&gt; My experience of HTTP authentication is that the fixed user interface
&gt; makes it unpopular with users (or at least website designers) and that
&gt; has a knock on effect on the architecture of web services components
&gt; built as part of the same application.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It seems the ideas put forward in the link above were not
&gt; popular. Adding stuff to HTML doesn't seem like the right thing to do
&gt; anyway.
&gt;
&gt; I've always wondered why an authentication response couldn't have an
&gt; entity associated with it, either in the response body or referenced
&gt; via some content-location like header.
&gt;
&gt; If it were possible to associate an entity with the authentication
&gt; then browsers could render it when they find it and use the standard
&gt; dialog box when they don't.
&gt;
&gt; Would that sort of scheme violate REST principles in anyway?

&gt; But the user *does* have to type credentials over and over.  Fortunately,
&gt; the browser is doing the work for him.  Why would a RESTful application
care
&gt; whether the user was "logged in" or "logged out"?  All the server should
&gt; care about is that the user is authorized.
&gt;

If the browser is doing the work, then the use isn't typing username and
password for each page accessed in the realm.  That's like a "session"
between user (person) and UI (browser), which is different from a session
between UI and server, which is frowned upon in REST, for scaleability
reasons.

Above, I think you're talking about UI-server stuff; I'm not.

&gt;
&gt; I've always wondered why an authentication response couldn't have an

&gt; via some content-location like header.
Fundamentally, the user-agent (browser, spider, utility, etc.) is
responsible for placing the correct bits in the authentication header(s).
Displaying the entity associated with an authentication challenge is nice,
but without indicating that user input is meant as protocol-level
authentication, then the user-agent will not be able to manage that. That is
why adding stuff to HTML is necessary.

The alternative approach is that the server controls the lifetime of
authentication information - essentially cookie based.
Adding things to the protocol to support control over authentication
lifetime might be an approach that gives application authors control, but
provides visibility to user-agents (and intermediaries). The kinds of things
I'm thinking about are responses indicating 'forget auth for this realm' and
'remember this auth-token for this realm'. Cookies are a generalized form of
this, but you lose the visibility that there is security information in
there.

&gt; 1) When a browser is sending authentication with each request, prominantly
&gt; provide a button on the screen labeled "clear authentication" (or some
&gt; such).  A user can click on this at any time to force the browser to dump
&gt; the authentication.

This is the way DAVExplorer (a webDAV browser in Java,  la explorer) manage
authentication.
There is a menu function "clear auth buffer"

Subject:RESTfully distinguishing requests without content negotiation<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I want to provide a syndicated feed of my new blog system.  For starters, I
intend to support the following specs:

RSS 0.92
RSS 2.0

However, how would I RESTfully determine which version to return to a given
request?  Getting a request Accept: header value of "text/xml" or
"application/rss+xml" wouldn't necessarily do any good (would it?).  As a
result, I have implemented a query parameter called "rss" which can have the
values of "0.92" or "2.0".  However, I have seen some other blog systems
(most notably Sam Ruby's [1]) that use pseudo-extensions (".rss", ".rss2")
to acheive the same goal.

So, either way you look at it, a given resource could have three URIs.  Each
URI returns a slightly different representation of the resource (e.g.
additional data in RSS 2.0 that's not in RSS 0.92, etc.).  To some extent, I
think this is okay, RESTfully speaking.  However, this brings into question
the need for content negotiation.

When should one technique be used above another?  When conneg is not an
option, what is the best technique to use, and is that technique nothing but
a kludge?

Not AFAIK.  I'm surprised I haven't run into this yet, but in all the
work I've done with containers, PUT never made sense.  That doesn't
mean it can't though.

I always figured that when I did need to support PUT, I would end up
using WebDAV's 207 (Multi-Status) response.  AFAICT though, there's no
provision for communicating Location header values within the response.
I wonder if you could shove that in the response, as some XML encoded
RDF (and not break DAV clients)?

&gt; I'd like to be able 
&gt; to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, but 
&gt; the response I must return relates to the container, not its contents. 
&gt; Also I'm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be 
&gt; happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request, but 
&gt; this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside 
&gt; the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.

There's no problem with that from a REST POV, AFAIK.  Shit happens, so
to speak. 8-)

If I can rephrase this slightly, I have a similar question: is the
querystring (after the ? Character) part of the resource "noun" under REST?

In other words, given the following URL:

	http://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&amp;b=2

Is the "noun" resource http://www.my-server.com/foo with parameters attached
to the query, or is it http://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&amp;b=2 ?

If it's the latter, then I assume this is considered a completely different
"noun"?

	http://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&amp;b=2&amp;c=3

By my (admittedly limited) understanding of REST, the URL is simply an
address to a resource, and the server returns a representation of a
resource. So which is the resource in the first URL above?

Thanks,

Depends on your application.  In many application
domains, it is completely reasonable to generate a
different URL in each announcment email.

Alternatively:

&gt; &gt;You POST credentials to a login resource and
&gt; &gt;receive a redirect to the restricted URL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; But how do I relate that login resource to the resources that are protected?

You have a login resource per protected resource
or resources.

One REST pattern is that applications should
expose a single root URL from which you navigate
to the others.  So the redirect should probably be
to this root.

In HTTP, the resource is the full URI including the query terms. This means

&gt;
&gt; If each user gets his/her own URL then this is
&gt; equivalent to passing a name/password with each
&gt; request.
Except that the name is not visible to intermediaries as being a username,
and that users have no incentive to not share this URL with others.
However, if the name/password pair is also bound to the specific resource,
then you could disable that particular password when you like, without
affecting other resources - similar to 'capabilities'.

My favorite example for this is Google.  Consider the following URIs:

http://www.google.com/search?q=rest+patterns
http://www.google.com/search?q=soap+rpc

While they differ only by their querystrings, they identify two distinct 
resources.  One is a list of all known pages containing the words 'rest' 
and 'pattern', while the other is a list of all known pages containing 
the words 'soap' and 'rpc'.

&gt;&gt;So if I have a really large user population and I want 250000 of them to

&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Depends on your application.  In many application
&gt;domains, it is completely reasonable to generate a
&gt;different URL in each announcment email.
&gt;  
&gt;
While I'm sure there are possibilities that I've not thought of, I'm 
having difficulty imagining a scenario where that is a reasonable 
solution.  

The way I see it, having a URL per user has several disdvantages:
1. exponential explosion of URIs - one URL per resource per user - makes 
content management much harder than it needs to be
2. can't share URIs between authorized users since everyone has their 
own personal URI for a resource
3. kills caching since every unique user will use a different name for 
the same resource
4. provides no real security since all you need is a URI in order to 
access a supposedly protected resource

I'm sure others can add to this list.  

And for all that, I really can't think of any advantages.

&gt;Alternatively:
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;You POST credentials to a login resource and
&gt;&gt;&gt;receive a redirect to the restricted URL.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But how do I relate that login resource to the resources that are protected?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You have a login resource per protected resource
&gt;or resources.
&gt;
&gt;One REST pattern is that applications should
&gt;expose a single root URL from which you navigate
&gt;to the others.  So the redirect should probably be
&gt;to this root.
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm not sure I understand the connection between navigation from a root 
URL and REST.  I wasn't aware that REST said anything about how to 
organize your resources.

Actually, I'm not really sure I understand what you're proposing.  You 
seem to be suggesting that any time I want to access an arbitraty 
resource, I must navigate my way there from the root of something.  This 
seems to break so many of the principles of REST that I'm sure I 
misunderstand what you're suggesting.  Can you give an example of how 
this might work?

&gt;&gt; I've been working through a few issues related to how a container
&gt;&gt; resource behaves, and I'm not sure if I'm bumping into some limitations
&gt;&gt; of REST or HTTP.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for sharing this; I've been a bit complacent in posting my 
&gt; experiences with containers to this list.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; [snip example]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The idea here is that the contained resources are serialised in the
&gt;&gt; representation. I'm assuming that this is OK from a REST perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I see nothing wrong with it; it doesn't say anywhere 'one resource can't 
&gt; contain another', AFAIK.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now I want to modify a box. I'm going to use PUT to replace the whole
&gt;&gt; box. In doing this I'll naturally be replacing the contained widgets as
&gt;&gt; well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [snip example]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The response is
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this could be a 200 with the updated box/100?  The 204 just seems 
&gt; kind of 'useless' to me.

I've never been sure what to return in the message-body after a PUT. I 
figured that if the client needs to check the state of the resource (in 
case the server adds some information to the PUT representation), it 
could perform a GET request.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now, I've changed the colour of this box, and I've both changed the
&gt;&gt; colour of widget 33, and added a new widget 35 to the container. Also I
&gt;&gt; have deleted widget 34, since it now had no container, and this is not
&gt;&gt; allowed (in this particular application).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm.. I'm not sure that having widget 34 automatically 'fall off a 
&gt; cliff' is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; It may be helpful to consider the fact that 'widgets can not have no 
&gt; container' a constraint specific to your application, and try and find a 
&gt; strategy that is RESTful to enforce it.
&gt; 
&gt; Idea:
&gt; Perhaps you should explore the concept of a 'reaper' process (a client 
&gt; UA or something on the server) which periodically searches and destroys 
&gt; orphaned widgets (it could use explicit DELETE requests to do this on 
&gt; the results of a GET /widgets?parent=null or whatever).
&gt; 
&gt; But see below.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My question is, have I done too much at once here? I'd like to be able
&gt;&gt; to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, but
&gt;&gt; the response I must return relates to the container, not its contents.
&gt;&gt; Also I'm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be
&gt;&gt; happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request, but
&gt;&gt; this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside
&gt;&gt; the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.
&gt; 

My reading of RFC 2616 seems to indicate this is OK. I've just started 
reading RFC 2518 (WEBDAV), and theres a whole load of stuff in there 
about containers and nesting.

&gt; 
&gt; I have asked the same question (aloud, not on the list).  I think its 
&gt; something of a grey area.
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than a big fat PUT to the container, you could split your request 
&gt; up in to a number of constituent requests to constituent resources.  for 
&gt; example:

My application semantics require that the update is atomic. This fits 
nicely with the idea of supplying a 'complete' representation of a 
container resource (with all its contained resources).

&gt; 
&gt; 1. PUT to widget/33 changing the colour.  this would (or should?) update 
&gt; box/100 automatically because it has a dependency on widget/33.

Agreed

&gt; 2. POST widget/35's URI to box/100 (possible after POSTing 35 to widgets).

Again there are choices here. I can either POST the URI for the 
contained resource (widget 35) into the container :

POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
    &lt;widget x:href="/widget/35"&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;

Provided widget 35 already exists I'd assume the server response would be

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

Or I could post the respresentation of the contained resource to the 
container:

POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
    &lt;widget&gt;
      &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
      &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
      &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;/widget&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;

Now I'm not sure what the response is - 201 Created seems absolutlely 
the right thing here, but it simply breaks if I POST the respresntation 
of two new resources at the same time

POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
    &lt;widget&gt;
      &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
      &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
      &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;/widget&gt;
    &lt;widget&gt;
      &lt;widget_id&gt;40&lt;widget_id&gt;
      &lt;colour&gt;White&lt;/colour&gt;
      &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;/widget&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;

Now the only response possible seems to be 204 (or 200) - I can't 
respond with two lots of 201 Created. And this can only get more complex 
if we consider the case then a POST to that box could create one widget 
and modify another.

&gt; 3. DELETE 34.
&gt;    or
&gt;    PUT box/100 minus the mention of widget/34.
&gt; 
&gt; the trouble with the delete of 34 is that the semantics are overloaded. 
&gt;  the PUT to the box that excludes the 34 really only removes it from the 
&gt; container, rather than deleting it outright.  these are two seperate 
&gt; semantic actions.

I think the semantics I need require that deleteing a container will 
also delete all of the resouces it contains - atomic requirement again. 
I could see that case that this would not be a requirement in all 
applications.

&gt; 
&gt; i would be interested to hear what you (and others) think of this.
&gt; 
&gt; D.J. Adams has written about this same idea at
&gt; http://www.pipetree.com/space/RtRest (warning this is cutnpaste from the 
&gt; HTML):
&gt; 
&gt; --CUT
&gt; Having something like /ticket/42/basics/status returning a 
&gt; representation of ticket 42's status in text/plain, say "new", is a very 
&gt; attractive feature, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; GET /ticket/42/basics/status HTTP/1.1
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&gt; Connection: Close
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain
&gt; 
&gt; open
&gt; 
&gt; Preferable to composing a method call, serialising it into XML, sending 
&gt;  it to an end point, and then parsing the result out of the XML that 
&gt; comes back, all to retrieve such a simple piece of data. It's intriguing.
&gt; --CUT
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, thanks again for the thought-provoking post, and the coherent 
&gt; example (works wonders when trying to ask a question!).

I like the idea that you have both a flat and a fully nested 
respresentation to play with. I wondered about too in the past.

As far as exports are concered I'd imagine that you could deal with the 
issue of XBEL fragments vs conformant XBEL documents by using content 
negotiation, rather than a separate URI space. Sending the appropriate 
Accept: header would indicate whether a fragment or a standalone XBEL 
document was required. Or would this be an abuse of Accept:? This 
approach could also be used to specify 'flat' for neseted resource 
expansions.

if the client isn't interested it can check for 200 or whatever and 
throw away the body.

i am thinking of a scenario where an abbreviation or shortcut string 
(like "/.") is PUT and its expansion ("slashdot") is used as the 
representation.  maybe this isn't useful enough to warrant returning an 
entity body, but perhaps there are application use cases where it is.

&gt;&gt; Rather than a big fat PUT to the container, you could split your 
&gt;&gt; request up in to a number of constituent requests to constituent 
&gt;&gt; resources.  for example:
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
&gt;     &lt;widget x:href="/widget/35"&gt;
&gt; &lt;/box&gt;

why the outer &lt;box&gt; element in the body?  haven't you addressed that in 
the request URI?  i don't want to appear to be pedantic but this looks 
like an instance of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) anti-pattern.

what are the semantics if the request URI and the (xpath) /box/x:href 
attribute is another (different) URI?

&gt; Provided widget 35 already exists I'd assume the server response would 
&gt; be
&gt;
&gt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
&gt;
&gt; Or I could post the respresentation of the contained resource to the
&gt; container:

&gt;       &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/widget&gt;
&gt; &lt;/box&gt;

i think whether you use the URI or the inline representation depends on 
whether the widget is being implicitly created.  if it already exists i 
would definitely say that the URI should be used.  if there is no URI, 
then the server application can go ahead and implicitly create it.  i 
think all combinations of uri/representation are acceptable so long as 
their semantics are clearly defined, e.g.:

uri | representation | action
----+----------------+--------------------------------------
   1 |              0 | use uri
   1 |              1 | use uri (ignore representation)
   0 |              1 | create (using supplied represenation)
   0 |              0 | invalid

&gt; Now I'm not sure what the response is - 201 Created seems absolutlely

&gt;     &lt;widget&gt;
&gt;       &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
&gt;       &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
&gt;       &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/widget&gt;
&gt;     &lt;widget&gt;
&gt;       &lt;widget_id&gt;40&lt;widget_id&gt;
&gt;       &lt;colour&gt;White&lt;/colour&gt;

agreed.  however i question how important this use case is.  can't you 
always just POST one widget at a time?  then you can reject input with 
more than one URIless widget element.

also i think this scenario breaks down if you accept my previous point 
about the redundancy of the outer &lt;box&gt; element.  you couldn't have a 
second &lt;widget&gt; element in this case because you can only have one root 
element in an XML document.

another possibility to throw in the soup is that box resources could 
have subordinate 'widgets' container resources to which you POST e.g. 
/boxes/100/widgets but i won't go in to that here.

<pre>Frankly, I think this is an excellent idea.  In a similar vein, this was my
suggested solution to a Meta-Query header conversation over in the
distributed-registry list.  My only fear would be that using URIs in fields
like Accept and Content-Type would break many existing applications.  One
way we could maintain backwards compatibility would be to add another MIME
type like "alt/uri".  When this type was present, it would tell the
application to look for another header or headers.  The name of the
header(s) would be specific to the protocol.  For instance, in HTTP, the
MIME type might indicate the presence of a header called "Content-Type-URI:"
or some such.

While I could see someone getting carried away with the idea, I don't think
that it would be a good idea to compare XML Namespace URIs and Media Type
URI.  In my head, they are not the same thing.  URI Media Types are just a
way to make media type registration distributed, while XML Namespace URIs
are used to mix multiple document parts within a single package.  Very
different usage to me.

Besides... just think what this could do for XML Namespaces.  :)  Instead of
using the namespacing mechanism, one could define a media type URI to
indicate the usage of a specific set of XML vocabularies.  As a result, as
long as this media type was encountered, element names, etc. would be
uniform across *all* documents.  Then you would be able to have your
regex-able xml.  :)

if using x- and x. is discouraged, and registration is encouraged, this 
still seems to leaves a single point of failure (the IANA).

the IANA is also as vulnerable as any other single authority to being

correct me if i'm wrong, but i think the problems of URIs being used to 
identify namespaces are to do with a lack of understanding of what URIs 
are, rather than problems arising simply because of the use of URIs per 
se.

IMO the problems can be associated with the same type of people who 
believe fallacies like 'the web is a filesystem' and 'a URI is a 
filesystem path, so where's the file'?

thanks for your points anyway.

I agree they're not the same thing, but they are both using an HTTP URI as a unique identifier.
Using an HTTP URI as a unique identifier for anything but a web resource
is fraught with problems:

1. Users will take those URIs and plug them into a browser. What should they get back?
   (The "what does a namespace uri dereference to is an [xml-dev] permathread.)
2. How do you compare two URIs? Are they case sensitive? Because some parts of an HTTP
   URI are not case sensitive while some other parts may be case sensitive. 
   What about escaped characters, 
   i.e. does %42 in the URI get decoded or left as is? (How to compare two URIs 
   is another issue on the tags plate: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#URIEquivalence-15 )

I don't want to throw cold water on the idea, just pointing out that you're wandering
into some pretty murky waters :)

just 
&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt; &gt;&gt; kind of 'useless' to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've never been sure what to return in the message-body after a
PUT. I
&gt; &gt; figured that if the client needs to check the state of the
resource (in
&gt; &gt; case the server adds some information to the PUT representation),
it
&gt; &gt; could perform a GET request.
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, but why make the client perform an extra request?
&gt; 
&gt; if the client isn't interested it can check for 200 or whatever and 
&gt; throw away the body.
&gt; 
&gt; i am thinking of a scenario where an abbreviation or shortcut
string 
&gt; (like "/.") is PUT and its expansion ("slashdot") is used as the 
&gt; representation.  maybe this isn't useful enough to warrant
returning an 
&gt; entity body, but perhaps there are application use cases where it
is.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Rather than a big fat PUT to the container, you could split your 
&gt; &gt;&gt; request up in to a number of constituent requests to constituent 
&gt; &gt;&gt; resources.  for example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My application semantics require that the update is atomic. This
fits
&gt; &gt; nicely with the idea of supplying a 'complete' representation of a
&gt; &gt; container resource (with all its contained resources).
&gt; 
&gt; agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. POST widget/35's URI to box/100 (possible after POSTing 35 to 
&gt; &gt;&gt; widgets).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again there are choices here. I can either POST the URI for the
&gt; &gt; contained resource (widget 35) into the container :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
&gt; &gt; Content-Type: text/xml
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;widget x:href="/widget/35"&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/box&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; why the outer &lt;box&gt; element in the body?  haven't you addressed
that in 
&gt; the request URI?  i don't want to appear to be pedantic but this
looks 
&gt; like an instance of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) anti-pattern.

I'm glad you mentioned that, I'll try to explain. The box resource is
both a container (for widgets) and a resource as well (it has &lt;colour&gt;
in my original example). If I POST to a box I have to have a way of
updating its colour, as well as updating the widgets it contains.
Therefore I need a container element. But I think I may just have
placed the wrong container around it in my example. So the example
should probably be (namespace attrs removed for brevity)

POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;app:resource&gt;
  &lt;colour&gt;Moonlight beige&lt;/colour&gt;
  &lt;widget x:href="/widget/35"&gt;
&lt;/app:resource&gt;

I've used the app:resource as generic resource representation to hold
the updated colour information and updated information saying that
widget 35 is now contained by this box.

&gt; 
&gt; what are the semantics if the request URI and the (xpath)
/box/x:href 
&gt; attribute is another (different) URI?

Quite, it does seem somehow wrong to duplicate this information which
shold be completely clear from the request URI.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Provided widget 35 already exists I'd assume the server response
would 
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or I could post the respresentation of the contained resource to
the
&gt; &gt; container:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
&gt; &gt; Content-Type: text/xml
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;widget&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;/widget&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/box&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; i think whether you use the URI or the inline representation
depends on 
&gt; whether the widget is being implicitly created.  if it already
exists i 
&gt; would definitely say that the URI should be used.  if there is no
URI, 
&gt; then the server application can go ahead and implicitly create it. 
i 
&gt; think all combinations of uri/representation are acceptable so long
as 
&gt; their semantics are clearly defined, e.g.:
&gt; 
&gt; uri | representation | action
&gt; ----+----------------+--------------------------------------
&gt;    1 |              0 | use uri
&gt;    1 |              1 | use uri (ignore representation)
&gt;    0 |              1 | create (using supplied represenation)
&gt;    0 |              0 | invalid
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now I'm not sure what the response is - 201 Created seems
absolutlely
&gt; &gt; the right thing here, but it simply breaks if I POST the
respresntation
&gt; &gt; of two new resources at the same time
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; POST /box/100 HTTP/1.1
&gt; &gt; Content-Type: text/xml
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;box x:href="/box/100"&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;widget&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;widget_id&gt;35&lt;widget_id&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;colour&gt;Black&lt;/colour&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;/widget&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;widget&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;widget_id&gt;40&lt;widget_id&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;colour&gt;White&lt;/colour&gt;
&gt; &gt;       &lt;size&gt;9&lt;/size&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;/widget&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/box&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now the only response possible seems to be 204 (or 200) - I can't
&gt; &gt; respond with two lots of 201 Created. And this can only get more 
&gt; &gt; complex
&gt; &gt; if we consider the case then a POST to that box could create one
widget
&gt; &gt; and modify another.
&gt; 
&gt; agreed.  however i question how important this use case is.  can't
you 
&gt; always just POST one widget at a time?  then you can reject input
with 
&gt; more than one URIless widget element.

I dont think so. It seems wrong to prevent me updating more than one
property of the box resource at one time. If the box has width and
height, as well as containing widgets, I should be able to POST to
update the width and height at the same time surely? Why should this
methodology not apply also to the widgets that are in the box?

&gt; 
&gt; also i think this scenario breaks down if you accept my previous
point 
&gt; about the redundancy of the outer &lt;box&gt; element.  you couldn't have
a 
&gt; second &lt;widget&gt; element in this case because you can only have one
root 
&gt; element in an XML document.

I think this is covered by the modification involving the
&lt;app:resource&gt; as an outer container. It is needed because the box
itsself has properties that must be modifiable via POST.

&gt; 
&gt; another possibility to throw in the soup is that box resources
could 
&gt; have subordinate 'widgets' container resources to which you POST
e.g. 
&gt; /boxes/100/widgets but i won't go in to that here.

Yes thats true. Logically the URI for a widget could be a subcomponent
of the URI for a box. This might have some advantages, in that there
would be no need to specify the box that a widget was contained in as
part of the representation of a widget. But I guess thats something
that you'd actually _want_ to specify, because doing a GET on
/widget/40 should return a representation that contains the URI to its
container, so that I can follow this URI for more information.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. DELETE 34.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    or
&gt; &gt;&gt;    PUT box/100 minus the mention of widget/34.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; the trouble with the delete of 34 is that the semantics are 
&gt; &gt;&gt; overloaded.
&gt; &gt;&gt;  the PUT to the box that excludes the 34 really only removes it
from 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; container, rather than deleting it outright.  these are two
seperate
&gt; &gt;&gt; semantic actions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think the semantics I need require that deleteing a container
will
&gt; &gt; also delete all of the resouces it contains - atomic requirement
again.
&gt; &gt; I could see that case that this would not be a requirement in all
&gt; &gt; applications.
&gt; 
&gt; absolutely not; this mirrors the functionality of cascading 
&gt; updates/deletes in a relational database, and is therefore specific
to 
&gt; applications.

&gt; &gt; This approach could also be used to specify 'flat' for neseted resource

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One can use the "Depth:" dav header to specify the "flatness" of a

That is an interesting idea, but I had poked around at the WebDAV 
spec and my reading of it was that Depth: was only supported on 
LOCK, COPY, MOVE and PROPFIND.

All in all, it seemed conceptually simpler to accomplish
what I wanted without introducing all the semantics of any of
the WebDAV stuff.

&gt; As far as exports are concered I'd imagine that you could deal with the
&gt; issue of XBEL fragments vs conformant XBEL documents by using content
&gt; negotiation, rather than a separate URI space. Sending the appropriate
&gt; Accept: header would indicate whether a fragment or a standalone XBEL
&gt; document was required. Or would this be an abuse of Accept:? This
&gt; approach could also be used to specify 'flat' for neseted resource
&gt; expansions.

I'm not sure that there is any hard-and-fast rule about how to employ
the Accept: header, but I think the general use case is one in which 
the various resource respresentations are otherwise addressable on
their own.  For example, you PUT to

    /image/test.jpg
    /image/test.bmp
    /image/test.gif

but GET from

    /image/test 

with an appropriate Accept header.

Most of the examples I've seen of pushing the Accept: header much
beyond this start to subtly introduce what amounts to a hidden 
address space.

&gt;Quite a number actually. The basic mechanism that Alex proposed,
&gt;inserting an unguessable random number into a URL, can be used to
&gt;implement distributed capability security. The capability security
&gt;model has been used to secure a wide range of software, from
&gt;operating systems to end-user applications.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm
&gt;&gt;having difficulty imagining a scenario where that is a reasonable
&gt;&gt;solution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The way I see it, having a URL per user has several disdvantages:
&gt;&gt;1. exponential explosion of URIs - one URL per resource per user - makes
&gt;&gt;content management much harder than it needs to be
&gt;&gt;2. can't share URIs between authorized users since everyone has their
&gt;&gt;own personal URI for a resource
&gt;&gt;3. kills caching since every unique user will use a different name for
&gt;&gt;the same resource
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It appears that you're only thinking about protecting read-access
&gt;to a read-only resource. I base this on your assumption that many
&gt;users have access to a shared (and cacheable!) resource.
&gt;
&gt;This really isn't a very good example to use when trying to
&gt;understand the benefits of capability-based security. For
&gt;starters, the example isn't one in which there are any actually
&gt;enforceable security properties. You can't prevent users from
&gt;sharing access to the resource with "unauthorized" users. There is
&gt;also very little sense is revoking read-access to a cacheable
&gt;resource: why get it from the site at all when you've still got it
&gt;in your cache.
&gt;
&gt;For a better overview of capability-based security, I suggest the
&gt;paper at:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html
&gt;
&gt;The paper explains capability-based security using tradeable

I have to confess that the above paper is way too dense for my humber

&gt;For an explanation of how capability-based security could be

&gt;The paper also uses tradeable electronic credit as an example, but
&gt;with a different design. The paper describes a RESTful interface
&gt;for tradeable electronic credit.
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm at a disadvantage here since I really don't understand the 
capability model that's being described.  However, reading the paper, I 
got the sense that security is provided as a result of traversing a 
graph.  This doesnt seem terribly useful - why should I have to traverse 
a graph to get to a resource every time I want to access the resource? 
 Why can't I just directly access it.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;4. provides no real security since all you need is a URI in order to
&gt;&gt;access a supposedly protected resource
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A lot of people get hung up on this, since they are so used to
&gt;username/password. Consider that a randomly-generated 128 bit
&gt;number contains more entropy than any password you could possibly
&gt;remember. If it were possible to guess a random 128 bit number, it
&gt;would also be possible to break any symmetric-key encryption
&gt;algorithm. A symmetric encryption key is typically also 128 bits.
&gt;

I really dont get this.  Perhaps I'm dense, but it just doesn't seem

Quite a number actually. The basic mechanism that Alex proposed,
inserting an unguessable random number into a URL, can be used to
implement distributed capability security. The capability security
model has been used to secure a wide range of software, from
operating systems to end-user applications.

&gt; I'm
&gt; having difficulty imagining a scenario where that is a reasonable
&gt; solution.
&gt;
&gt; The way I see it, having a URL per user has several disdvantages:
&gt; 1. exponential explosion of URIs - one URL per resource per user - makes
&gt; content management much harder than it needs to be
&gt; 2. can't share URIs between authorized users since everyone has their
&gt; own personal URI for a resource
&gt; 3. kills caching since every unique user will use a different name for
&gt; the same resource

It appears that you're only thinking about protecting read-access
to a read-only resource. I base this on your assumption that many
users have access to a shared (and cacheable!) resource.

This really isn't a very good example to use when trying to
understand the benefits of capability-based security. For
starters, the example isn't one in which there are any actually
enforceable security properties. You can't prevent users from
sharing access to the resource with "unauthorized" users. There is
also very little sense is revoking read-access to a cacheable
resource: why get it from the site at all when you've still got it
in your cache.

For a better overview of capability-based security, I suggest the
paper at:

http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html

The paper explains capability-based security using tradeable
electronic credit as an example. This is a better example to use
when explaining capability-based security.

For an explanation of how capability-based security could be
applied using REST design principles, I suggest my own paper at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/

The paper also uses tradeable electronic credit as an example, but
with a different design. The paper describes a RESTful interface

A lot of people get hung up on this, since they are so used to

&gt; I'm at a disadvantage here since I really don't understand the
&gt; capability model that's being described.

The basics of the model are fairly simple. Based on your next
sentence, it looks like you've already groked the main point.

&gt; However, reading the paper, I got the sense that security is
&gt; provided as a result of traversing a graph.

That's correct. The graph basically says: "If a user has access to
this resource, they are also authorized to use these other
resources." You can tell which resources the user is not
authorized to use by noticing that there is no way to get to those
resources by traversing the graph. Having a simple and
well-defined model like this makes it a lot easier to study your
application security and make sure you got it right.

&gt; This doesnt seem terribly useful - why should I have to traverse
&gt; a graph to get to a resource every time I want to access the resource?
&gt;  Why can't I just directly access it.

You can directly access it. Any resource in the graph can have a
URI associated with it. You can use this URI to directly access
the resource. The graph defines how you get additional URIs, given
the ones you've already got.

&gt; I really dont get this.  Perhaps I'm dense, but it just doesn't seem
&gt; useful to have a world where everybody gets their own URI to a single
&gt; resource.  What happens to sharing and linking?

You're not dense, just a little hard of hearing. ;) As I said in
the last message, you're right, you wouldn't use this model to
give everyone their own URI to a single, shared, read-only
resource. You use this model to protect and share access to
private resources.  Think more about your online banking interface
than your Wall Street Journal subscription.

For example, you might have a capability URL for your bank
account. From this resource, you can navigate to resources that
let you pay bills and view your withdrawal/deposit history. The
account history might be composed of a different resource for each
of the calendar months. At tax time, you might give your
accountant the URIs for your January to December account history
resources. Your accountant can then do up your tax forms, but
cannot pay bills from your account.

&gt; As far as exports are concered I'd imagine that you could deal with the

&gt; document was required. Or would this be an abuse of Accept:? This
&gt; approach could also be used to specify 'flat' for neseted resource
&gt; expansions.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure that there is any hard-and-fast rule about how to employ
&gt; the Accept: header, but I think the general use case is one in which 
&gt; the various resource respresentations are otherwise addressable on
&gt; their own.  For example, you PUT to
&gt; 
&gt;     /image/test.jpg
&gt;     /image/test.bmp
&gt;     /image/test.gif
&gt; 
&gt; but GET from
&gt; 
&gt;     /image/test 
&gt; 
&gt; with an appropriate Accept header.

This still would fit with the fragment vs complete doc issue - just take 
a couple of file extension, one for fragment (e.g. .frag), one for 
standalone compliant doc (.e.g. .xml). Then

GET /xbel/hello-world.frag

will return just the fragment, and

GET /xbel/hello-world.xml

will return the standalone compliant doc. Whats more this maps 
completely to the approach of using the accept header, one just needs a 
couple of mime type (mabe there is a standard for the XBEL one already?)

GET /xbel/hello-world
Accept: application/x-xbel-fragment

would give one representation, the other would be

GET /xbel/hello-world
Accept: application/x-xbel-standalone

&gt; 
&gt; Most of the examples I've seen of pushing the Accept: header much
&gt; beyond this start to subtly introduce what amounts to a hidden 
&gt; address space.

Yes and no. I see nothing wrong with using Accept: to choose the 
representation you want - its much cleaner than using a filename, 
because it allows multiple representations to have the same URI. By 
choosing a different URI (xbel-export) yu've effectively gone down the 
filename-like route, the only difference being folder name instead of 
file-extension (neither of which should matter to a client as the URI is 
opaque).

I'm playing with this with a current application.  I've got a mess of 
little resources, all of which have various representations.  This goes 
beyond mere MIME type to functional types;  for example, a given piece 
of content might also have an "editor" representation which 
encapsulates the content in a Web-based interface for editing and 
saving said content.  Hence, I've got URIs like:

/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=editor-xhtml
/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=printable-xhtml
/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rss2.0
/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=xml-raw
/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rdf-factset

This allows all of these things to be directly accessed by simply

&gt;
&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=editor-xhtml

i just thought i would chime in and mention that i am using a similar 
technique for web editing interfaces.  i have found that it doesn't 
make sense to have only a form-oriented HTML representation because 
e.g. drop-downs are problematic (read: impossible) to use hyperlinks 
with, and a pure HTML representation (with no form HTML) doesn't let 
you do any editing unless you're running some fringe client agent like 
amaya.

so i have a HTML representation, and put the form-HTML representation 
in a seperate resource.  i look at the form as a subordinate resource 
rather than just another representation.

i would be interested in hearing what others think of this, pros/cons 
etc.  my original thought process was that HTML forms don't have their 
own mime-type, (e.g. text/html+forms) so conneg was not an option.  
&lt;shrug&gt;

so i would have something like:
/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33/form

a GET on this gets you a HTML page with a form rather than 'normal' 
HTML; this form's target attribute is set to

/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33

the form does a POST but i pre-process this on the server to actually 
mean PUT.

&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rdf-factset
&gt;
&gt; This allows all of these things to be directly accessed by simply
&gt; GETting them, rather than having to dip into conneg.  AND it works well
&gt; for alternate representations that have some associated functionality,
&gt; beyond just this or that static format.

i was going to suggest that perhaps "Content-type" or something would 
be a better name than "repr" but deja-vu tells me this has come up on 
this list before.

off-topic tangent: try
http://www.google.com/search?q=rest-discuss+Content-type+Vincent
google doesn't seem to have crawled any archives of rest-discuss; 
bummer.  sometimes i hate yahoo groups.  i wonder whether the archives 
are hidden from crawlers behind their ads.

i do think its important that people use standard attribute name/values 
for this though.  otherwise interoperability will suffer big time, IMHO.

I use a similar technique with a new blog system I wrote.  In the case of

/blog?form=addentry
/blog?form=addfolder
/blog?form=editfolder

For "entry" resources, I have:

/blog/12?form=editentry
/blog/12?form=trackback

In each of these cases, a form related to an aspect of the resource is
returned.  This would be equivalent to your "?repr=editor-xhtml", I think.

Independently, I also allow the folders to be returned as RSS.  In case the
client is not using the Accept: header (my blog system supports conneg), you
can append the following query to the folder:

/blog?rss=0.91
/blog?rss=0.92
/blog?rss=0.93
/blog?rss=2.0

(depending on which version you want).  I think this would be similar to
your "?repr=rss2.0".  I just use two different query parameters, but is
otherwise the same.  However, I still treat all of these representations as
the same resource.  I do not consider them sub-resources or anything like
that.  I agree that a form to add a subfolder looks a lot different from an
rss feed, but who says that a given representation of a resource must convey
all of that resource?

Now, I do also have conneg support in the places that it can be used.  For
instance, submitting a request to a folder with an "Accept: text/xml", you
will get back the RSS2.0 feed.  Now, if I needed to return another xml
representation which also used "text/xml" as the mime-type, I would probably
have to fall back to the query string method.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>This topic has been in some of the threads lately, as well as in other
similar topics (see distributed-registry thread about Meta-Query).  How do
you go about, in a RESTful manner, returning different representations of
the same resource when those representations have the same content-type?
Admittedly, this is not a common case these days, but I think such a
scenario will become more frequent.

As mentioned in a couple posts, a common technique is to use a query string
to distinquish.  Another technique is to treat the variants as a sort of
sub-resource.  Both of these techniques have their advantages and
disadvantages.  However, the one disadvantage they both have is that they
are in no way standardized across implementations.  For instance, Jeff Bone,
Joe Gregorio, and I use different query strings for serving up RSS.

One of the nice things about MIME types is that they are "standardized",
hence the Accept header.  But that is course-grained.  For instance, there
is no way using Accept: to indicate whether the client wants to receive RSS
0.91 or RSS 2.0.  Sure, we could register more and more content-types, but
that seems like a nightmare (though I gather some work is being done to
address such a problem).

So what is a RESTful app to do?

&gt; &gt; &gt;For an explanation of how capability-based security could be

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The paper also uses tradeable electronic credit as an example, but
&gt; &gt; &gt;with a different design. The paper describes a RESTful interface
&gt; &gt; &gt;for tradeable electronic credit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm at a disadvantage here since I really don't understand the
&gt; &gt; capability model that's being described.
&gt;
&gt; The basics of the model are fairly simple. Based on your next
&gt; sentence, it looks like you've already groked the main point.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; However, reading the paper, I got the sense that security is
&gt; &gt; provided as a result of traversing a graph.
&gt;
&gt; That's correct. The graph basically says: "If a user has access to
&gt; this resource, they are also authorized to use these other
&gt; resources." You can tell which resources the user is not
&gt; authorized to use by noticing that there is no way to get to those
&gt; resources by traversing the graph. Having a simple and
&gt; well-defined model like this makes it a lot easier to study your
&gt; application security and make sure you got it right.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This doesnt seem terribly useful - why should I have to traverse
&gt; &gt; a graph to get to a resource every time I want to access the resource?
&gt; &gt;  Why can't I just directly access it.
&gt;
&gt; You can directly access it. Any resource in the graph can have a
&gt; URI associated with it. You can use this URI to directly access
&gt; the resource. The graph defines how you get additional URIs, given
&gt; the ones you've already got.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I really dont get this.  Perhaps I'm dense, but it just doesn't seem
&gt; &gt; useful to have a world where everybody gets their own URI to a single
&gt; &gt; resource.  What happens to sharing and linking?
&gt;
&gt; You're not dense, just a little hard of hearing. ;) As I said in
&gt; the last message, you're right, you wouldn't use this model to
&gt; give everyone their own URI to a single, shared, read-only
&gt; resource. You use this model to protect and share access to
&gt; private resources.  Think more about your online banking interface
&gt; than your Wall Street Journal subscription.
&gt;
&gt; For example, you might have a capability URL for your bank
&gt; account. From this resource, you can navigate to resources that
&gt; let you pay bills and view your withdrawal/deposit history. The
&gt; account history might be composed of a different resource for each
&gt; of the calendar months. At tax time, you might give your
&gt; accountant the URIs for your January to December account history
&gt; resources. Your accountant can then do up your tax forms, but
&gt; cannot pay bills from your account.

Subject:RE: [rest-discuss] more than one representation with the same MIME type<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
&gt; We should be proliferating mimetypes.  Their purpose is to 
&gt; represent different document expectations.  We should use 
&gt; them that way!

A rich set of MIME types is a good thing, but my issue with relying
on them for extracting different types of content from a single
resource comes down to a couple of points:

1.  How would you even know what content types are available?  If
    an indeterminate set of representations were associated with
    a resource, how would you even know what MIME types to chuck at it?

2.  Different content types may have completely different
    interfaces.  In my own application I happen to split
    some types out into "resource-spaces" that support 
    different methods: 

       /blog/x/y/z  GET only (HTML document)
       /rss/x/y/x   GET only (RSS 2.0 document)
       /xbel/x/y/z  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (XBEL document)

    It wouldn't feel particularly intuitive to have the available
    methods change based on the Accept: header or even a query
    string.

    I could see using a Accept: header to distinguish different RSS 
    types from the resources in the /rss "resource-space" above because 
    they are at least clearly different representations of a similar 
    underlying type, but a unique URL (a la query string?) should be 
    available too. Perhaps the absence of either in the request could 
    result in a 300 Multiple Choices, etc.

&gt;
&gt; We should be proliferating mimetypes.
&gt; Their purpose is to represent different document
&gt; expectations.
&gt; We should use them that way!

That would be nice, but the practice seems somewhat different than theory
here.

For instance, there is no way for a server to know which version of HTML to
return based on the content-type.  Should the HTML be strictly 3.2 or should
it be 4.0?  Using "text/html" is not enough.  Using the user-agent (which is
probably the most common technique) it just plain wrong.  A server can't
possibly know every user-agent out there and shouldn't even care.  To avoid
this, sites are left to tactics like home pages that have a low-end home
page with links to the rest of the site in different version.  Hardly a good
solution.

The same could be said for distinguishing between RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, and
2.0 (along with any other generic xml) since all that's used is "text/xml".
Using "text/rss+xml" wouldn't be enough either.  In my blog system, if it
gets "Accept:text/xml", it return RSS 2.0.  In order to get any other
version, you have to resort to a kludge (in this case using a query string
indicating the specific version).  This is just plain wrong and should not
be how it has to be done...

Now, maybe if people got into the habit of using a "version" parameter in
mime types, this could be avoided(?).  For instance, it would be no problem
to determine what a request means by "Accept:text/rss+xml;version=0.92".  I
realize you could just register something like "text/rss092+xml", but the
parameter is somewhat extensible without the need to register each new
version.  As is done with the xhtml "profile" parameter, it may even make
sense to use a URI instead of a simple version number.  This obviously has
tradeoffs, of course.

You're a true contrarian. ;)

Capabilities are actually very easy to use "in real life" and much
easier to use than ACLs. ACLs are difficult to manage and open you
up to all sorts of subtle security vulnerabilities. If you've ever
written code that uses ACLs, chances are you've written code that
is vulnerable to a Confused Deputy attack.

&gt; If I am looking at a page with my January
&gt; bank account history, I would like some way to
&gt; navigate back to the main menu....

There are solutions to this, but first I'll point out that this
issue doesn't apply to software programs.  "Web services" address
program to program communication. Programs have a stack and a heap
to help them keep track of what they've got and what they're
doing. A program doesn't "navigate back", it just dereferences a
variable.

It's also easy to implement "navigate back" from within a web
browser interface to the application. The simplest answer is just:
"Use the 'back' button to navigate 'back'.". A step up from there
is using frames. You can keep your main menu in a small frame
along the left or top of the screen. The main menu is then always
accessible to the user. If you don't like frames, you can use XSLT
to build a composite page on the server. The XSLT code can suck in
XML from a variety of capability URLs and then display a composite
page that includes navigation tools.

Everything really is at your fingertips. Having the security model
integrated right into the programming model really simplifies
things. Imagine building an application that aggregates
information from a bunch of different applications. With a
capability-based security model, you just suck in the XML and do
your thing. In an ACL model, you've got the additional headache of
managing credentials and authentication protocols with each
different application.

&gt; If I am the WSJ, how do I restrict access while
&gt; at the same time allow users to refer to the same
&gt; document?

You were the one who suggested this design, not me. This is now
the third time that I have said that this is a bad idea. You would
not use the capability model to solve this problem.

There's a long explanation that I could go into on this, but I'll
just give you the punch line. The WSJ scenario is *not* an access
control problem, it is a DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)
problem. The capability model is used for solving access control
problems, not DRM problems.

I'm not sure I'd agree that "web services" is about program to program

only a program at one end and some things that look like documents or 
document processors at the other end.  "Program-to-program

&gt;It's also easy to implement "navigate back" from within a web

This is an example of poor usability.  If I'm in the middle of a 
hierarchy, you better not make me hit the back button 50 times to get 
back to the home page (or whatever the starting point is).  Further, 
what if I've got that page bookmarked?  I never came in through the 
front page, so no amount of hitting the back button is going to get me 
there.

The link between the two topics is that HTTP Authentication is

Switching to capabilities improves your GUI, your application
design and your security.

&gt; which you have already

That is not the impression I intended to convey. Capability-based
security is the best choice for implementing access control. Both
capabilities *and* ACLs fail to implement DRM, so you might as
well stick with ACLs for DRM hacks. (More on this at the end of

Well, that's kinda the whole point of access control isn't it? Do
you want your bank account to be part of the public web of
resources?  If so, please send me the first link. ;)

The point of access control is to create private webs of
resources, with finely controlled links between them. Capabilities
are an excellent tool for implementing this.

&gt; As a result, you've lost the ability for people to connect
&gt; those resources together in new ways to create new things on the web.

Exactly the opposite.  What you've done is empowered people to
securely connect those resource that they want connected. The ACL
model prevents this.

Just as an example, why don't you post to this list a link to a
withdrawal record from your online bank account. With the current
interface, this is not possible: you can't do it without also
posting the password for your entire account. If your bank account
was implemented with a capability-based security model, posting
the withdrawal record link would be no problem.  Capabilities
enable you to create links.  ACLs prevent you from creating links.

&gt; &gt;There are solutions to this, but first I'll point out that this

Is it your contention that program to program communication is RPC
and therefore not REST? If so, this has grave implications for any
thoughts of business integration with REST.

My only point from the quoted paragraph is that browser GUI issues
do not apply to software integration through REST.

&gt; &gt;It's also easy to implement "navigate back" from within a web
&gt; &gt;browser interface to the application. The simplest answer is just:
&gt; &gt;"Use the 'back' button to navigate 'back'.".
&gt;
&gt; This is an example of poor usability.

In which case the more sophisticated techniques I layed out next
are appropriate.

&gt; Further, what if I've got that page bookmarked?

Bookmark the page that you want to bookmark. If you want to
bookmark the top level page, bookmark the top level page.

&gt; So how do you establish an initial context (or whatever its called) in a
&gt; capability-based system without doing authentication?

Your initial context is whatever set of URIs you start with. If
your program is an XSLT stylesheet, your initial context is the
set of URIs in the input XML document.

&gt; &gt;&gt;If I am the WSJ, how do I restrict access while
&gt; &gt;&gt;at the same time allow users to refer to the same
&gt; &gt;&gt;document?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;control problem, it is a DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)

&gt;
&gt; Well, you may just have go into your long explanation, because if DRM
&gt; isn't about controlling access, then I'm pretty confused.

Access control is about controlling what authority you hand out.
DRM is about controlling how people use authority they have
already been given.

In the WSJ scenario, a subscribed user is given the authority to
read WSJ articles. The read authority implicitly carries with it
the authority to pass-on the article to others. If you can read
bits, you can copy bits. Neither capabilities nor ACLs can prevent
you from giving a WSJ article to someone who is not a WSJ
subscriber. The best you can do is make it less convenient to
share the article. That is all the WSJ ACL does. It is just a
feeble DRM measure.

Fortunately, business integration and trading is about access
control, not DRM. Capabilities are ideal for this.

&lt;quote&gt;... you're right, you wouldn't use this model to give everyone

As far as I am able to observe, an awful lot of the web consists of 
shared, read-only resources.  Are you saying that access control isn't 
necessary for shared, read-only resources?

&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;
https://www.accountlink.pncbank.com/index.html  :-)  

Unfortunately, its not a good example because the frame that actually 
shows my account info has a URL that simply has a session id encoded in 
it.  Besides, I'm really not interested in sharing my bank account info.

A more useful example would be something like

https://www.bank.com/myaccounts/savings/register

With http auth, I can give this URL to everyone who has an account at 
the bank, and that URI means the same thing to all of them - the page 
that shows the viewer the last 20 entries in their savings account register.

I can put that link in a set of help pages that are not protected by any 
access controls (and that don't need to be dynamically rendered).  I can 
bookmark that page and always go straight to it (modulo a login 
 prompt).  I can send that link to a friend who also has an account at 
the same bank (to tell him how to get to his saving account register). 
 I can distribute a tool that somehow processes the info from a savings 
account register at my bank without requiring each user configure the 
tool with their private URI.

Note that I'm not suggesting that this is a good solution for accessing 
bank accounts - it just illustrates the idea of a public, sharable URI. 
 My understanding of the capability model leads me to conclude that I 
can't do anything like the above because every user would have to have 
their own URI.

&gt;The point of access control is to create private webs of
&gt;resources, with finely controlled links between them. Capabilities
&gt;are an excellent tool for implementing this.
&gt;  
&gt;
I dont disagree.  But it appears to me that the private web that is 
created is only useful to one individual.  What about groups of people? 
 If the answer is that everyone in the group shares the same, private 
URI, then how do I revoke access to just one member of the group. (I 
suspect your answer to this is going show that I don't understand the 
capability model after all.)

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;As a result, you've lost the ability for people to connect
&gt;&gt;those resources together in new ways to create new things on the web.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Exactly the opposite.  What you've done is empowered people to
&gt;securely connect those resource that they want connected. The ACL
&gt;model prevents this.
&gt;
&gt;Just as an example, why don't you post to this list a link to a
&gt;withdrawal record from your online bank account. With the current
&gt;interface, this is not possible: you can't do it without also
&gt;posting the password for your entire account. If your bank account
&gt;was implemented with a capability-based security model, posting
&gt;the withdrawal record link would be no problem.  Capabilities
&gt;enable you to create links.  ACLs prevent you from creating links.
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm not sure why.  Assuming the withdrawal record has a URI, I dont see 
why I couldn't do that using a non-capability-based solution.  (I've 
also just realized that we're probably using the word _link_ differently.)

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;There are solutions to this, but first I'll point out that this
&gt;&gt;&gt;issue doesn't apply to software programs.  "Web services" address
&gt;&gt;&gt;program to program communication. Programs have a stack and a heap
&gt;&gt;&gt;to help them keep track of what they've got and what they're
&gt;&gt;&gt;doing. A program doesn't "navigate back", it just dereferences a
&gt;&gt;&gt;variable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm not sure I'd agree that "web services" is about program to program
&gt;&gt;communication.  I'm sure there are a lot of "web services" where there's
&gt;&gt;only a program at one end and some things that look like documents or
&gt;&gt;document processors at the other end.  "Program-to-program
&gt;&gt;communication" the way you  seem to be using it sounds a lot like an RPC
&gt;&gt;model to me, and in my mind REST and RPC don't mix.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Is it your contention that program to program communication is RPC
&gt;and therefore not REST? If so, this has grave implications for any
&gt;thoughts of business integration with REST.
&gt;  
&gt;
No, that is not my contention - but only because I don't know what form 
that program-to-program communications takes.  If it is RPC, then no, it 
is not REST.  And yes, that does have implications for business 
integration with REST, but I wouldn't call them grave.

&gt;My only point from the quoted paragraph is that browser GUI issues
&gt;do not apply to software integration through REST.
&gt;  
&gt;
I agree.

&gt;&gt;So how do you establish an initial context (or whatever its called) in a
&gt;&gt;capability-based system without doing authentication?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Your initial context is whatever set of URIs you start with. If
&gt;your program is an XSLT stylesheet, your initial context is the
&gt;set of URIs in the input XML document.
&gt;
But how do I (as a client) get that initial set of URIs without 
participating in some kind of authentication process?  What do I click 
on (or reference) to get started?

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I am the WSJ, how do I restrict access while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at the same time allow users to refer to the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;document?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;You were the one who suggested this design, not me. This is now
&gt;&gt;&gt;the third time that I have said that this is a bad idea. You would
&gt;&gt;&gt;not use the capability model to solve this problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm not disagreeing, but how about giving an example of something
&gt;&gt;(web-based) that you would use a capability model to solve.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I did. Your web-based bank account.
&gt;
Ok - I guess I meant an example of how you would solve it.  What does 
the URI namespace look like?  How do you navigate among the various 
resources?

&gt;&gt;&gt;There's a long explanation that I could go into on this, but I'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;just give you the punch line. The WSJ scenario is *not* an access
&gt;&gt;&gt;control problem, it is a DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem. The capability model is used for solving access control
&gt;&gt;&gt;problems, not DRM problems.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, you may just have go into your long explanation, because if DRM
&gt;&gt;isn't about controlling access, then I'm pretty confused.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Access control is about controlling what authority you hand out.
&gt;DRM is about controlling how people use authority they have
&gt;already been given.
&gt;  
&gt;
I wont contest your definition, but my impression is that most people 
dont use that definition (rightly or wrongly).  Controlling access to a 
Resource (the R in URI) is about determining whether or not you are 
allowed to perform an operation on that resource - are you allowed to 
perform a GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.  

Which brings me to another question.  I understand that you control who 
can access a URI by controlling to whom you give the URI, but how do you 
control how they access the named resource.  That is, how do you control 
whether or not they can POST vs GET?

&gt;In the WSJ scenario, a subscribed user is given the authority to
&gt;read WSJ articles. The read authority implicitly carries with it
&gt;the authority to pass-on the article to others. If you can read
&gt;bits, you can copy bits. Neither capabilities nor ACLs can prevent
&gt;you from giving a WSJ article to someone who is not a WSJ
&gt;subscriber. The best you can do is make it less convenient to
&gt;share the article. That is all the WSJ ACL does. It is just a
&gt;feeble DRM measure.
&gt;
I don't even think they're attempting DRM - its not necessary.  But 
that's a different discussion (one that I'm not interested in having 
either).

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] W3C Note - User Agent Authentication FORM elements<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>As the guy on the fence, here is my review of the
state of play so far:

1. There is an obvious conflict between UI and
capabilities.  It is obviously better to have
the option of having back links on a page rather
than being forced to play with frames.  But in
practice this conflict is not large because the
application designer can offer links to
"safe-to-share" URLs that don't link back and in
practice, you rarely want to share access-control
information (as distinct from DRM info).
Advantage: HTTP-Auth +.5

2. The practical advantage of capabilities is not
in sharing data, it is in manipulating it.  If I
simply want to share data in a HTTP auth world, I
can simply email it.  The only reason capabilities
offer an advantage over HTTP-Auth is if I need to
offer another POST/PUT/DELETE on the data and
don't want to go through some annoying ACL update
process to get there.
Note: if the data is large and complex then you
may want a viewer URL, in which case capabilities
are superior in this repect as well.
Advantage: Capabilities +.5

3. Access Control and DRM are different
applications.  Capabilities and HTTP-AUTH both
suck for DRM.  Capabilities are arguably better
for DRM because you can put a link on the page
that exposes the sender to harm if shared too
widely (but then you have to educate the user
about the risks of sharing)
Advantage Capabilities +.5

4. Getting to a user-specific starting
point requires some authentication process.
So either you use the standard HTTP-auth process
or something application specific.  Interop makes
HTTP-auth preferable, however there is no reason
that that presentation of an HTTP-auth credential
does not simply redirect you to a capability
graph.  Public login points are shared.  The
resulting URLs are not (like the bank session-id).
Advantage HTTP-auth +.5 Capabilities +.5

4. Many uses of HTTP-AUTH appeare unRESTful?
&gt; https://www.bank.com/myaccounts/savings/register
&gt;
&gt; With http auth, I can give this URL to everyone who has an account at
&gt; the bank, and that URI means the same thing to all of them - the page
&gt; that shows the viewer the last 20 entries in their savings account register.
&gt; I can put that link in a set of help pages that are not protected by any
&gt; access controls (and that don't need to be dynamically rendered).  I can
&gt; bookmark that page and always go straight to it (modulo a login
&gt;  prompt).  I can send that link to a friend who also has an account at
&gt; the same bank (to tell him how to get to his saving account register).

Shouldn't a URL uniquely identify a resource?
Having the content of the resource be completely
different depending on the login information
seems... wrong.

At minimum you POST authentication information to
a URL and should then get back a redirect to
unique URL for your savings register.

The URL you should share would be this POST url
not the URL of your actual data....

Advantage Capabilities +.5

So, in practice, it looks like the answer is both.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I should note first, that I'm a bit confused where this thread is going.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems to me that we started by bitching about how browsers aren't
&gt; &gt;&gt;terribly helpful with HTTP authentication.  Somehow, we've ending up
&gt; &gt;&gt;talking about capabilities-based security,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The link between the two topics is that HTTP Authentication is
&gt; &gt;also not terribly helpful for implementing access control.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Which isn't surprising since its HTTP _Authentication_.  But that's
&gt; neither here nor there.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Switching to capabilities improves your GUI, your application
&gt; &gt;design and your security.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'll take your word on the security bit.  I'm not convinced of the other
&gt; two.  I get the feeling that you'd just end up trading one set of
&gt; problems for another.  But again, that's neither here nor there.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;which you have already
&gt; &gt;&gt;indicated isn't really the best choice for the majority of what's on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;web today.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That is not the impression I intended to convey. Capability-based
&gt; &gt;security is the best choice for implementing access control. Both
&gt; &gt;capabilities *and* ACLs fail to implement DRM, so you might as
&gt; &gt;well stick with ACLs for DRM hacks. (More on this at the end of
&gt; &gt;the message.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; So then, I don't understand your comment from an earlier message:
&gt; &lt;quote&gt;... you're right, you wouldn't use this model to give everyone
&gt; their own URI to a single, shared, read-only resource. &lt;/quote&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As far as I am able to observe, an awful lot of the web consists of
&gt; shared, read-only resources.  Are you saying that access control isn't
&gt; necessary for shared, read-only resources?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I think part of the problem I have is that with a capability model, it
&gt; &gt;&gt;seems that you end up with everyone having their own private web of
&gt; &gt;&gt;resources rather than having a public web of resources that are sharable
&gt; &gt;&gt;with others.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, that's kinda the whole point of access control isn't it? Do
&gt; &gt;you want your bank account to be part of the public web of
&gt; &gt;resources?  If so, please send me the first link. ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; https://www.accountlink.pncbank.com/index.html  :-)
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, its not a good example because the frame that actually
&gt; shows my account info has a URL that simply has a session id encoded in
&gt; it.  Besides, I'm really not interested in sharing my bank account info.
&gt;
&gt; A more useful example would be something like
&gt;
&gt; https://www.bank.com/myaccounts/savings/register
&gt;
&gt; With http auth, I can give this URL to everyone who has an account at
&gt; the bank, and that URI means the same thing to all of them - the page
&gt; that shows the viewer the last 20 entries in their savings account register.

&gt;  prompt).  I can send that link to a friend who also has an account at
&gt; the same bank (to tell him how to get to his saving account register).
&gt;  I can distribute a tool that somehow processes the info from a savings
&gt; account register at my bank without requiring each user configure the
&gt; tool with their private URI.
&gt;
&gt; Note that I'm not suggesting that this is a good solution for accessing
&gt; bank accounts - it just illustrates the idea of a public, sharable URI.
&gt;  My understanding of the capability model leads me to conclude that I
&gt; can't do anything like the above because every user would have to have
&gt; their own URI.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The point of access control is to create private webs of

&gt; &gt; We should be proliferating mimetypes.  Their purpose is to

&gt;
&gt; A rich set of MIME types is a good thing, but my issue with relying
&gt; on them for extracting different types of content from a single
&gt; resource comes down to a couple of points:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  How would you even know what content types are available?  If
&gt;     an indeterminate set of representations were associated with
&gt;     a resource, how would you even know what MIME types to chuck at it?
&gt;
&gt; 2.  Different content types may have completely different
&gt;     interfaces.  In my own application I happen to split
&gt;     some types out into "resource-spaces" that support
&gt;     different methods:
&gt;
&gt;        /blog/x/y/z  GET only (HTML document)
&gt;        /rss/x/y/x   GET only (RSS 2.0 document)
&gt;        /xbel/x/y/z  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (XBEL document)
&gt;
&gt;     It wouldn't feel particularly intuitive to have the available
&gt;     methods change based on the Accept: header or even a query
&gt;     string.
&gt;
&gt;     I could see using a Accept: header to distinguish different RSS
&gt;     types from the resources in the /rss "resource-space" above because
&gt;     they are at least clearly different representations of a similar
&gt;     underlying type, but a unique URL (a la query string?) should be
&gt;     available too. Perhaps the absence of either in the request could
&gt;     result in a 300 Multiple Choices, etc.

My point is simply that MIME provides the OBVIOUS

Better to fix MIME implementations, than to create

&gt; &gt; We should be proliferating mimetypes.
&gt; &gt; Their purpose is to represent different document
&gt; &gt; expectations.
&gt; &gt; We should use them that way!
&gt;
&gt; That would be nice, but the practice seems somewhat different than theory
&gt; here.
&gt;
&gt; For instance, there is no way for a server to know which version of HTML to
&gt; return based on the content-type.  Should the HTML be strictly 3.2 or should
&gt; it be 4.0?  Using "text/html" is not enough.  Using the user-agent (which is
&gt; probably the most common technique) it just plain wrong.  A server can't
&gt; possibly know every user-agent out there and shouldn't even care.  To avoid
&gt; this, sites are left to tactics like home pages that have a low-end home
&gt; page with links to the rest of the site in different version.  Hardly a good
&gt; solution.
&gt;
&gt; The same could be said for distinguishing between RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, and
&gt; 2.0 (along with any other generic xml) since all that's used is "text/xml".
&gt; Using "text/rss+xml" wouldn't be enough either.  In my blog system, if it
&gt; gets "Accept:text/xml", it return RSS 2.0.  In order to get any other
&gt; version, you have to resort to a kludge (in this case using a query string
&gt; indicating the specific version).  This is just plain wrong and should not
&gt; be how it has to be done...
&gt;
&gt; Now, maybe if people got into the habit of using a "version" parameter in
&gt; mime types, this could be avoided(?).  For instance, it would be no problem
&gt; to determine what a request means by "Accept:text/rss+xml;version=0.92".  I
&gt; realize you could just register something like "text/rss092+xml", but the
&gt; parameter is somewhat extensible without the need to register each new
&gt; version.  As is done with the xhtml "profile" parameter, it may even make
&gt; sense to use a URI instead of a simple version number.  This obviously has
&gt; tradeoffs, of course.

&gt; I don't know enough about MIME politics to know
&gt; the correct answer to whether you proliferate MIME
&gt; types (per se) or simply add a version parameter.
&gt;
&gt; My point is simply that MIME provides the OBVIOUS
&gt; and traditional mechanism for solving this
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; Better to fix MIME implementations, than to create
&gt; an entirely new mechanism for content-type.

I agree.  To that end:

I propose the addition of a new MIME subtype to each of the 8 existing
media-types.  The name of the subtype will be "type-uri".  The type will
have a single required parameter "uri", whose value is a URI.  The complete
media type (including URI) will identify a specification.

The following limitations are placed on the URI (yes, Joe.  I know I'm
wading into those murky waters.  &lt;g&gt;) :

1) Creation rules of a new URI *must* be according to the scheme used.

2) The URI *must* be compared at the octet level.  As a result, creators of
new URIs should be very careful about the characters they use to ensure
maximum compatibility (e.g. do not use characters that may need escaping in
some instances).  This also means that URIs are case-sensitive.  I realize
that some schemes are case-insensitive, but require a case-sensitive version
of the URI to be used will not break those schemes.

3) If the scheme used has any form of dereferencing, then the URI *must* be
dereferencable and *should* dereference to details about the associated
specification.  Since it is not possible to guarantee that a URI will be
dereferencable at all times (e.g. network or server outages), recognition of
the MIME type *must* not rely on the ability to derefence the URI.  For this
purpose, the URI must be recognized as nothing more than an octet string.

4) It is strongly recommended that a dereferencable URI point to an entity
describing (or otherwise directing the user to) the associated
specification.


That's it really.  I'm sure there are all sorts of unanswered... umm...
questions.  So let's here them.  If you have a better suggestion for the
subtype name, let's here that too.  :)

&gt;&gt;With http auth, I can give this URL to everyone who has an account at

&gt;&gt;that shows the viewer the last 20 entries in their savings account register.
&gt;&gt;I can put that link in a set of help pages that are not protected by any
&gt;&gt;access controls (and that don't need to be dynamically rendered).  I can
&gt;&gt;bookmark that page and always go straight to it (modulo a login

&gt;&gt;the same bank (to tell him how to get to his saving account register).
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Shouldn't a URL uniquely identify a resource?
&gt;Having the content of the resource be completely

But it does identify a single resource.  The resource is NOT Chuck 
Hinson's bank account - the resource is 'my' bank account with 'my'

That is sophistry.  Most charitably, I would refer
you to all the people who want URL's for the
different variants produced in
content-negotiation.

But I think that authentication is very different
from content negotiation.  The notion that mailing
the URL of a WSJ article means something different
from mailing the URL of a bank savings register is
a little odd.

Using HTTP-auth for customization is abusive.
Now, I can define all sorts of resources
parametrized by username password.

Rather than adding a id=thingid to the query
string.  In the future, I can simply pass thingid
in the username...

True.  However, there are safeguards (which may or may not be resistant to
these issues):

1) Use PURLs.  Hmm... we could change "type-uri" to "purl" and just use the
PURL mechanism.  :)
2) Do not use a dereferencable URI scheme.  Heck, we could even come up with
one specifically for this purpose.  It would even be able to adress your
other comment about the "[ease of remembering] the names of MIME type you
actually use."
3) Just because a specification changes doesn't mean that it's bad.  As long
as the specification has its own versioning built in, it would be no
different than asking for an "image/gif" without knowing whether you will
get back an 87a or 89a version.
4) I want to point out that the dereferencability of a of a URI is a
convenience only in my proposal.  In order to determine whether a given
media-type is recognized, the URI must be interpreted as a string only.

I should point out that this technique should not replace the existing
registration process.  The regular registration process has much value in of
itself.  If anything, this technique is a cross between using the "x-" and
full registration.  For the very reasons you point out above, people should
not rely on them as much as you would for a registered media-type.  On the
other hand, the use of a URI allows for additional authority and guarantee
of uniqueness that "x-" does not.  For instance, RSS 1.0 is an RDF document
while RSS 2.0 is not.  It would not make sense to use "application/rss+xml"
for both of them (which doesn't even appear to be a registered media type).
On the other hand, if each had something like:

RSS 1.0 : application/type-uri;uri="http://example.invalid/rss10"
RSS 2.0 : application/type-uri;uri="http://sample.invalid/rss20"

There would be no mistaking which is which.

&gt; Anything wrong with the vnd- system?

This still requires you to register each new subtype.


I am not convinced myself that this is the right way to go about doing
things.  It's just that I have adde conneg to an application and suddenly
realized just how useless it can be, both in terms of support for it and in
terms of the available media-types out there.  This is just an attempt to
answer my own frustration at it all.  In truth, I would like a better
solution, but until one comes along would this one "work"?

<pre>I'm sorry.  I was waayy too strident (too little
sleep).

Anyway, the question remains: Is it RESTful for
resources to be parametrized by authentication
information?

From an API, it would be sort of annoying if a
resource can be completely different depending on
auth.

From a UI perspective, it strikes me as
frustrating not to be able to mail a URL to the
exact resource I am looking at if I want to.

OTOH it also strikes me that it would be nice to
be able to specify a URL for this TYPE of
resource.  My instinct is that application
providers should provide distinct login entry
points.

Anyone else have an opinion here?

&gt;
&gt; I'll take your word on the security bit.  I'm not convinced of the other
&gt; two.

So how important is application security to you and others on this
list? Are there people on this list that implement business
applications, or is it mostly open use applications?

I request that the list owner open a poll on this question: "I am
currently implementing a web-service that provides access to a
business process. yes/no".

&gt; So then, I don't understand your comment from an earlier message:
&gt; &lt;quote&gt;... you're right, you wouldn't use this model to give everyone
&gt; their own URI to a single, shared, read-only resource. &lt;/quote&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As far as I am able to observe, an awful lot of the web consists of
&gt; shared, read-only resources.  Are you saying that access control isn't
&gt; necessary for shared, read-only resources?

Often, access control does not make sense for a shared, read-only
resource. To answer the question, you have to study the situation
to determine the roles of the participants.

In order for shared access to be an access control problem, it
must be the case that *all* participants want to protect access to
the shared resource. If any participant does not care about
protecting access, the access-control mechanism is without
meaning.  This is the case in the WSJ example.

When only a subset of the participants wish to protect access to
the shared resource, the problem is a DRM problem.

Typically, access to a shared resource is only an access control
problem when the shared resource is modifiable. It is rare for a
modifiable resource to be shared between more than two
participants.

&gt; A more useful example would be something like
&gt;
&gt; https://www.bank.com/myaccounts/savings/register
&gt;
&gt; With http auth, I can give this URL to everyone who has an account at
&gt; the bank, and that URI means the same thing to all of them - the page
&gt; that shows the viewer the last 20 entries in their savings account
&gt; register.

Ah, but that's not the question I asked you. Can you post a
traversable link to an entry from *your* account history?

&gt; Note that I'm not suggesting that this is a good solution for accessing
&gt; bank accounts - it just illustrates the idea of a public, sharable URI.
&gt;  My understanding of the capability model leads me to conclude that I
&gt; can't do anything like the above because every user would have to have
&gt; their own URI.

Telling someone how to access their own resource is also easily
done in the capability model. Using the graph that defines the
structure of the web of resources, you can determine what path
they need to follow. So, in a capability solution, you would say:
"Starting from your main account page, follow the path:
'savings/register/'." Using my web-calculus solution, you would do
this by appending the query string "?path=savings/register/" to
the main account page URI.

&gt; &gt;The point of access control is to create private webs of
&gt; &gt;resources, with finely controlled links between them. Capabilities
&gt; &gt;are an excellent tool for implementing this.
&gt;
&gt; I dont disagree.  But it appears to me that the private web that is
&gt; created is only useful to one individual.  What about groups of people?
&gt;  If the answer is that everyone in the group shares the same, private
&gt; URI, then how do I revoke access to just one member of the group. (I
&gt; suspect your answer to this is going show that I don't understand the
&gt; capability model after all.)

I think you are still thinking about DRM scenarios. As I said
above, it is rare for a modifiable resource to be shared between
more than two participants.

When you want to have revokable access to a shared resource, you
do give each participant a unique URI for the shared resource. To
revoke access, you revoke just the corresponding URI. This is no
more complex than managing an ACL for the resource would be.

&gt; &gt;&gt;As a result, you've lost the ability for people to connect
&gt; &gt;&gt;those resources together in new ways to create new things on the web.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Exactly the opposite.  What you've done is empowered people to
&gt; &gt;securely connect those resource that they want connected. The ACL
&gt; &gt;model prevents this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just as an example, why don't you post to this list a link to a
&gt; &gt;withdrawal record from your online bank account. With the current
&gt; &gt;interface, this is not possible: you can't do it without also
&gt; &gt;posting the password for your entire account. If your bank account
&gt; &gt;was implemented with a capability-based security model, posting
&gt; &gt;the withdrawal record link would be no problem.  Capabilities
&gt; &gt;enable you to create links.  ACLs prevent you from creating links.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure why.  Assuming the withdrawal record has a URI, I dont see
&gt; why I couldn't do that using a non-capability-based solution.  (I've
&gt; also just realized that we're probably using the word _link_ differently.)

Does your bank account have a separate ACL for every addressable
resource? Are you allowed to modify those ACLs? Are you allowed to
introduce new principals into the ACL system? Are you allowed to
delegate all of this authority to others? Typically, the answer to
all these questions is 'no'. To support linking, all these
questions have to be answered 'yes'.  An ACL design becomes far
too complex when it tries to answer 'yes' to all these questions.
When the application becomes this complex, it becomes a playground
for crackers.  A capability security model supports fine-grained
linking with minimal complexity.

&gt; &gt;&gt;So how do you establish an initial context (or whatever its called) in a
&gt; &gt;&gt;capability-based system without doing authentication?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Your initial context is whatever set of URIs you start with. If
&gt; &gt;your program is an XSLT stylesheet, your initial context is the
&gt; &gt;set of URIs in the input XML document.
&gt;
&gt; But how do I (as a client) get that initial set of URIs without
&gt; participating in some kind of authentication process?  What do I click
&gt; on (or reference) to get started?

Are you asking how a new user gets added to an existing
application? If so, the first URI is given to the new user in much
the same way as a username/password is given to a new user.

&gt; Ok - I guess I meant an example of how you would solve it.  What does
&gt; the URI namespace look like?  How do you navigate among the various
&gt; resources?

If you want a fully worked out example, I suggest something
simpler, like the tradeable credit example in the web-calculus
specification:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/

The schemas for all the resources used in this example can be
found at:

http://waterken.com/iou/

&gt; &gt;Access control is about controlling what authority you hand out.
&gt; &gt;DRM is about controlling how people use authority they have
&gt; &gt;already been given.
&gt;
&gt; I wont contest your definition, but my impression is that most people
&gt; dont use that definition (rightly or wrongly).

I agree that most people don't know the first thing about
software security. I blame this mostly on the complexity of
existing software security solutions. I think the simpler
capability security model could change the status quo.

&gt; Controlling access to a
&gt; Resource (the R in URI) is about determining whether or not you are
&gt; allowed to perform an operation on that resource - are you allowed to
&gt; perform a GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.

Actually, that's just a product of access control. Access control
is about how you came to have the authority to perform a
GET/PUT/POST/DELETE, how you exercise that authority, and how you
delegate that authority to others. This is a subtle but very
important distinction. The difference has caused great confusion
and error for many people, even some very smart people.

&gt; Which brings me to another question.  I understand that you control who
&gt; can access a URI by controlling to whom you give the URI, but how do you
&gt; control how they access the named resource.  That is, how do you control
&gt; whether or not they can POST vs GET?

One of the main design principles in capability-based security is
that distinctions in authority be reified as different resources.
If POST and GET provide different kinds of authority, they should
be different resources, accessed through different URIs.

This means that GET on a POSTable resource should only provide
information about what to POST. GETing the results of POSTing
should be a different URI. This means you've got one URI that
provides read-access to the current state of the resource, and a
different URI that provides the authority to modify the state of
the resource. Most existing web-applications are already designed
this way.

&gt; This topic has been in some of the threads lately, as well as in other
&gt; similar topics (see distributed-registry thread about Meta-Query).  How do
&gt; you go about, in a RESTful manner, returning different representations of
&gt; the same resource when those representations have the same content-type?
&gt; Admittedly, this is not a common case these days, but I think such a
&gt; scenario will become more frequent.
&gt;
&gt; As mentioned in a couple posts, a common technique is to use a query string
&gt; to distinquish.  Another technique is to treat the variants as a sort of
&gt; sub-resource.  Both of these techniques have their advantages and
&gt; disadvantages.  However, the one disadvantage they both have is that they
&gt; are in no way standardized across implementations.  For instance, Jeff
&gt; Bone, Joe Gregorio, and I use different query strings for serving up RSS.
&gt;
&gt; One of the nice things about MIME types is that they are "standardized",
&gt; hence the Accept header.  But that is course-grained.  For instance, there
&gt; is no way using Accept: to indicate whether the client wants to receive RSS
&gt; 0.91 or RSS 2.0.  Sure, we could register more and more content-types, but
&gt; that seems like a nightmare (though I gather some work is being done to
&gt; address such a problem).

Actually this is possible, and standardized if rss would be a registered 
mime-type [1] with version as an optional attribute. It seems as if rss is 
not registered.

&gt;
&gt; So what is a RESTful app to do?

Actually i think most of the underpinnings for this already exist in the
HTTP specification [1] and mime-type standards. A content type may
contain optional attributes (version/level etc). If you look at the
mime-type [2] of xml-xhtml you can see they they have the optional
attribute 'profile'. Also you have the accept-quality 'q' parameter in an
accept clause and thus write:

Accept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7,  application/xhtml+xml;q=1.0

or even:

Accept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7,  application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9, 
application/xhtml+xml;profile="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd"
;q=0.9

The 'only' remaining problem is that few mime-types define optional parameters
and even fever user-agents send them. But if you use your own internal 
mime-types and/or other mime-types with optional attributes defined and 
control both client and server end then you can go right ahead and use
this syntax. Actually at some points in time html supported level
and version but they've been removed since nobody used them.

Just some quick notes regarding the caching reasoning in the bug:

A cache cannot assume an url derived from content-location can be used by
subsequent requests because content-location is not valid in the scope the
cache is interested in. Simple examples:

1) If get / -&gt; content-location=/secure/index.html and /secure/index.html lies 
within a protected security domain then the cache might fail delivering the 
correct page if it tried to retrieve it. 
2) Also if get /index.html -&gt; content-location=index_tuesday.html a cache 
would deliver wrong document if it tried fetching it from content-location on 
a wednesday.

This is the reasons a _formal_ cache can't use this information. But this 
doesn't mean it's not usable for web-centric applications but that it doesn't
provide information a cache can depend on. The requirements for the 
information a cache can depend on must be rather strict to avoid most of the
erratical behaviour caches can introduce.

Actually the scoping of content-location is rather narrow. It's only valid 
within the request ( for the page requested ). But this suffices to make
it very useful by removing the need for a lot of the redirects todays 
web-applications is built around since it defines the base uri of the
entity requested.

I think it'd be good if apache delivered it in as many cases as reasonable 
since a lot of people tend to look at apache to see how a response 'should' 
look and if it would be used there it probably will become more widely 
adopted in both servers and browsers.

Message:<br><br>

I've been working with the Tamino WebDAV Server and 
found that its implementation of PUT stores the 
entity using the XML infoset and not a byte-for-byte
copy. For example, PUT-ing:

  &lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;

will be retrieved using GET as:

  &lt;test/&gt;

I know this issue has come up several times on this
list, but it is interesting to see that one major vendor
at least has interpreted the semantics of PUT in a data-centric
way as opposed to a document-centric way.  I tend to agree
with their approach as it makes PUT much more useful.

Still, is Tamino wrong?  Why?

If you don't care about comments, then it doesn't matter whether they are
stripped or not.  It all depends on your application.  Restricting PUT in
ways that are more of a hinderance than a help to some applications doesn't
seem right.  Of course, a given application can always be more restricitve
if desired, but those same restrictions should not be forced on all
applications (imho).

Frankly, I have found little practical use for PUT.  It may be because it's
too limiting.  It may be because it's too difficult to use in some cases
(such as updating container resources).  In the end, about the only thing
that it seems safe to use it for is creation of a new resource when you have
control over the URI space.  And even then, issues such as the one being
discussed come up.

PUT just can't win, no matter how hard it tries...

<pre>By data I meant the underlying data model of the document
type itself.

If you have an entity of Content-Type: text/xml:

  &lt;test   attr1 = "foo"   attr2="bar"   /&gt;

and you claim that the whitespace is significant,
then strictly speaking you don't really have an XML
document anymore.

So if you PUT the above element with Content-Type of
text/xml then GETting back

  &lt;test attr1="foo" attr2="bar"/&gt;

has to be okay.  If the space is significant then
use text/plain, the server may reject it.  If PUT
demands that even with a known type of XML, that
byte-for-byte fidelity be maintained, then the
semantics are pathological to the point of not
being useable except for storing files.

Similarly if you further refine the type to being say,
an RSS 2.0 document, then whitespace text nodes, for
example between &lt;item&gt; elements, or between the &lt;rss&gt;
and &lt;channel&gt; elements aren't significant, so lossily
storing those documents has to be okay too.

If this isn't true, I'd like to understand why.

I'm not sure why everybody thinks PUT is so limited and worse, why
everybody thinks that GET must return _exactly_ what was previously
PUT'ted. Again, like all the HTTP verbs, the server gets to
**_interpret_** the body of the PUT request however it wants. It does
not have to be a byte-for-byte copy (particularly since this reduces
the server to just a plain old fileserver). Further, the body of a PUT
is a _representation_ of a resource and representations are logical
constructs which can be serialized to many different byte format and
encoding schemes. 

The server can add information, remove information, ignore
information--heck it might even generate something completely
different. PUT, like the other verbs, is a logical operation
representing 'UPDATE' (and it is analagous to SQL's UPDATE or most
file system's overwriting save). The way I see it, PUT provides a very
elegant mechanism for a client to tell the server 'replace the data
here with this' or 'change this data this way' which is necessary when
you're sending representations back and forth.

Also, I really don't think PUT should be used for resource creation.
This is not only because PUT is idempotent and resource creation is
usually a violent process full of side effects that it's not
idempotent. Further, it's been my experience, that using PUT in this
way just leads to all types of ambiguity and sutle bugs because
neither the server or the client really know what's going on and it's
always unclear whether a resource is being created or simply updated.  
So, imo, use POST for resource creation and PUT for updating/overwriting.

Does this imply, then, that whenever a client issues a successful PUT
request, that the client should immediately perform a GET of that
request (or whatever uri was given in a Location header) if it wants to
do any further processing of that resource?

(I seem to remember some discussion of this a couple of months back, but
I don't think it was ever resolved)


&gt; Also, I really don't think PUT should be used for resource creation.
&gt; This is not only because PUT is idempotent and resource creation is
&gt; usually a violent process full of side effects that it's not
&gt; idempotent. Further, it's been my experience, that using PUT in this
&gt; way just leads to all types of ambiguity and sutle bugs because
&gt; neither the server or the client really know what's going on and it's
&gt; always unclear whether a resource is being created or simply updated.  

That is why there is a difference between a 201 Created status code and
a 200 OK.

Personally, I'm all for using PUT to create resources, and creating
environments where that sort of thing _is_ idempotent. After all, that
is how it is supposed to be.

&gt; information?


I don't believe it is.  The identity of a thing shouldn't be coupled to 
any Access Control List information I have about that thing.

Another reason: try to write RDF statements about a bank account, where 
that bank account is identified in a relative way.

Relative ID: http://example.bank.com/account

You can't write anything about that account because to truely identify 
it, you need ACL information.  And in the HTTP world, the authentication 
is done outside the URI.

If you had an absolute ID for a bank account, then you can actually say 
things about it.

Absolute ID: http://example.bank.com/account/12345

Then, this becomes possible (in RDF):

&lt;bank:Account rdf:about="http://example.bank.com/account/12345"&gt;
   &lt;bank:ownedBy rdf:resource="http://example.com/person/88888"/&gt;
   &lt;bank:balance&gt;$1,334.23&lt;/bank:balance&gt;
&lt;/bank:Account&gt;

You can't do the above w/ the Relative ID.  All the RDF statements would 
end up saying that *everyone* owns account http://example.bank.com/account.

This is all true, because HTTP's authentication is done at the protocol 
level, and independent of the URI.  The ID of the thing you are trying 
to operate on is not affected by any ACL information.

Now, having said that, this is a perfectly valid Absolute ID:

http://example.bank.com/account?owner_id=88888

But, of course, not as friendly w/ some caches and search engines.  And, 
you still have to supply a password (or some authenticating token).

Hope that helps,
Seth

<pre>The following may be of interest to this list. - Tony


The OpenURL Framework: ANSI/NISO Draft Standard

The proposed ANSI/NISO Standard "The OpenURL Framework (Z39.88)" has
been released for Public Comment. This standard builds on the draft
OpenURL (version 0.1) already in use, making it extensible for use
within communities beyond the "scholarly information" community.
OpenURL is currently used in the digital library world for linking to
the "appropriate copy" of a resource.

The standard is titled "The OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive
Services, Part 1: ContextObject and Transport Mechanisms". This
document defines the general framework to bundle specific packages of
contextual metadata and transport them over the network.

The second document, titled: "The OpenURL Framework for Context
Sensitive Services, Part 2: Initial Registry Content", details core
properties that can be used in actual instantiations of the general
framework. This Part can be used by communities to implement an
instantiation of the OpenURL Framework. Other Communities may use this
Part as a guideline for the definition and implementation of other
instantiations.

The public-comment period starts on March 12 and will last at least
until April 15, 2003. The Standard will be released for trial use
sometime after April 15th.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have been kicking around the idea of creating a simple, distributed, message system using REST practices.  I know that there are some such things out there already, but I am looking for extreme simplicity.  The fundamental goal is to see if I can replace my SMTP/POP3 application with something RESTful.  It must be simple and easy to implement.  I expect to whip an initial version in PHP in a few evenings...

And I'm looking for a few good RESTifarians to join me.  For those of you who might be interested, read over the following initial noodlings of mine.  If I can build enough interest, I'll see about setting up a dedicated YahooGroup or site or something.


Suppose two parties want to send each other messages.  Each party has a URI that identifies themselves.  This would be similar to an e-mail address.  For illustration purposes, the following URIs are used:

http://example.invalid/users/seairth
http://sample.invalid/members/bob

Now, suppose I want to send a message to bob.  I would take the following steps:

1) Create a Message on my server and assign a URI to it. (e.g. http://example.invalid/users/seairth/msg/1234)
2) Send a POST request to bob's URI.  The content-type could be any number of formats, but I will use XML for readability sake:

    &lt;notification&gt;
        &lt;from uri="http://example.invalid/users/seairth"
              name="Seairth Jacobs"/&gt;
        &lt;message uri="http://example.invalid/users/seairth/msg/1234"
                 subject="Is this RESTful?"
                 reply-uri="http://example.invalid/users/seairth/msg/1234"/&gt;
    &lt;/notification&gt;

3) bob's server examines the notification and accepts or rejects it.  Acceptance would be performed with a 202 (Accepted) response, while rejection would happen with a 403 (Forbidden) response.  It would also be possible to return a 400 (Bad Request) if bob's server failed to understand the notification well enough to accept or reject it.

4) Suppose bob's server has accepted a URI from me.  Later, bob starts up his client and uses the URI to get the actual message.

That's it.  Done.

Now for some additional details:

-------------------
In the above notification, the following is optional:

* The "name" attribute of the from element: the friendly name can be provided as an aid.  However, the only authoritative attribute is "uri".

* The "reply-uri" attribute of the message element: if not given, then the "from" element's "uri" attribute MUST be used for all replies to that message.  If given, then "reply-uri" MUST be used for all replies to that message.

-------------------
Additional notes:

*   The value of the "reply-uri" attribute does not need to match either the "from" element's "uri" attribute or the "message" element's "uri" attribute.  In the above example reply-uri" could have just as easily been "http://example.invalid/users/seairth/reply/1234".  The purpose for a separate reply URI is to allow chaining of messages (i.e. message threads).

* While there is no technical limit on any of the values, the recipient may reject a notification if any value is longer than can be handled. This should be done with the 400 (Bad Request) response, not 403 (Forbidden).

* In order to validate that the message URI was in fact sent by the from-URI, the recipient MAY submit a specific POST message to the from-uri to validate it.  Further details below.

* The recipient MUST NOT access the resource until the notification has been dealt with.  The sender MAY not provide access until the notification is accepted.

* Acceptance of a notification does not mean that the recipient will retrieve the message.  It only indicates that the recipient acknowledged the request.

* The subject is nothing more than a very short (one-liner) excerpt to give the recipient an idea of what the message is about.

* The recipient may reject a notification due to a value given.  For instance, if the "from" element's "uri" attribute value is being "blocked", the recipient may reject the notification outright.  Any such refusal MUST be done with the 403 (Forbidden) response.  The recipient may optionally choose to indicate in the response why the notification was rejected.

* If the notification is accepted, a 202 (Accepted) response MUST be used.  The recipient may optionally choose to return an entity, but the sender is not required to process any such entity.

* Note that it would be possible to send messages of URIs that the sender did not create.  For instance, I could have sent bob a link to an interesting CNN report or some such, as long as that thing has a URI.

* Obviously, the message does not need to be HTML.  It could be any sort of format.  If desired, the recipient can use HEAD on the resource to determine specifics.

* Because the resource (when created by the sender) is always on the sender's server, additional features are available that are not available in traditional "push" style message systems.  For instance, spelling mistakes can be corrected.  Messages can be deleted before your boss discovers what you really think of him, etc.  Obviously, once a recipient performs a GET on a resource, they have a copy... mistakes and all.

-------------------
Validating Notifications:

Obviously, it would be possible from someone to submit a notification claiming to be someone they are not.  This is a common problem in SMTP, which is partly why spam is so wide-spread (no accountability).  However, this can be easily remedied by asking the supposed sender if they really did send the notification.  For instance, suppose bob were to be suspicious of my notification. He would then take the following steps:

1) Post to my URI the following (again in XML for convenience):

    &lt;notification-query&gt;
        &lt;message uri="http://example.invalid/users/seairth/msg/1234"/&gt;
        &lt;to uri="="http://sample.invalid/members/bob" /&gt;
    &lt;/notification-query&gt;

2) My server would either recognize the combination and return a 204 (No Content), or returned 400 (Bad Request) to indicate that it's not recognized.


Note:  If the message URI contains the from URI as its root (as in my original example), the probability is pretty good that the sender really did create the messages.  

-------------------
Notification Issues:

One of the bits that I haven't yet worked out is how to ensure that only the intended recipient can retrieve the resource.  I have some thoughts on this (mostly using HTTP Authentication in various ways), but I'll put that off until I see if there's any interest out there...


So...  Anyone interested?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Anyone interested? (long)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I am interested in this as well, but, as we
discussed earlier, it faces the difficulty of
retrieving only "new" messages.

Assuming, we follow Roy Fielding's reccomdendation
and view a mailbox as a container for
messages/notifications, we need a way to query for
all messages since the last time the client
checked.

Here are some approaches and their issues:
1. Modify the server's state each time the client
checks for messages, but that prevents multiple
clients from sharing the same mailbox without
proliferating server state and it also prevents
the same user from going back to a prior state
without substantial added complexity.

2. Use a parametrized URL, like:

  GET /getNewNotifications?since=UID

where UID is the unique identifier of the last
message retrieved, but this seems unRESTful in
that this URL is not really opaque (In the
Wiki Jeff Bone appears to argue that this is ok,
so I am not really sure, but to me it feels
unRESTful)

3. Use a single range headers against a single
mailbox URL, but that prohibits you from changing
the representation of the underlying mailbox.  If
we want the server periodically to check
availability of actual messages and update on that
basis, we can't use range headers.

4. Use multipart-byteranges.
I think this is the best option, but a. most
clients don't suppport it and b. it verges on
specification abuse.

A much more useful way to go would be for the HTTP
authors not to have used bytes as the only units
for range headers.  If HTTP allowed range headers
to be specified in application units e.g. records,
then this would all be very easy.  Unfortunately,
they didn't and we have HTTP as it currently
stands.

&gt;     &lt;/notification-query&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2) My server would either recognize the combination and return a 204 (No Content), or returned 400 (Bad Request) to indicate that it's not recognized.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Note:  If the message URI contains the from URI as its root (as in my original example), the probability is pretty good that the sender really did create the messages.
&gt;
&gt; -------------------
&gt; Notification Issues:
&gt;
&gt; One of the bits that I haven't yet worked out is how to ensure that only the intended recipient can retrieve the resource.  I have some thoughts on this (mostly using HTTP Authentication in various ways), but I'll put that off until I see if there's any interest out there...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So...  Anyone interested?

I am not sure if I understand you correctly. But if the issue here is to 
retrieve only new messages instead of the entire inbox on the specified 
resource (i.e. a bandwidth/efficiency issue), you can use rproxy (or 
rproxy like functionality) in your server.

<pre>There are two separate issues being discussed here:

1) The messaging infrastructure between the sender and recipient
2) The ability for the recipient to retrieve messages/notifications

In my original post, all I really focused on was #1 above.  I'm not so sure
that the second part should be "standardized".  As you point out, there are
many different ways that the "mailbox" may be used by the recipient(s).
Different people are going to have different needs.  As a result, client
interfaces are going to vary.  It might be good to define a one or two
"common" interfaces to allow implementation-independent tools to be used.
However, I do not think it a good idea to discourage additional interfaces.
Otherwise, it feels like the square-peg-in-round-hole syndrome that has made
a mess of so many other web specifications as of late (imho).

But I don't want to get ahead of myself here.  It does look like we have a
couple people interested (and I hope that more will join).  As a result, I
have started a new mailing list (rest-messaging@yahoogroups.com).  Please
feel free to join and contribute.  :)

From: "S. Alexander Jacobson" &lt;alex@...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am interested in this as well, but, as we
&gt; discussed earlier, it faces the difficulty of
&gt; retrieving only "new" messages.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming, we follow Roy Fielding's reccomdendation
&gt; and view a mailbox as a container for
&gt; messages/notifications, we need a way to query for
&gt; all messages since the last time the client
&gt; checked.
&gt;
&gt; Here are some approaches and their issues:
&gt; 1. Modify the server's state each time the client
&gt; checks for messages, but that prevents multiple
&gt; clients from sharing the same mailbox without
&gt; proliferating server state and it also prevents
&gt; the same user from going back to a prior state
&gt; without substantial added complexity.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Use a parametrized URL, like:
&gt;
&gt;   GET /getNewNotifications?since=UID
&gt;
&gt; where UID is the unique identifier of the last
&gt; message retrieved, but this seems unRESTful in
&gt; that this URL is not really opaque (In the
&gt; Wiki Jeff Bone appears to argue that this is ok,
&gt; so I am not really sure, but to me it feels
&gt; unRESTful)
&gt;
&gt; 3. Use a single range headers against a single
&gt; mailbox URL, but that prohibits you from changing
&gt; the representation of the underlying mailbox.  If
&gt; we want the server periodically to check
&gt; availability of actual messages and update on that
&gt; basis, we can't use range headers.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Use multipart-byteranges.
&gt; I think this is the best option, but a. most
&gt; clients don't suppport it and b. it verges on
&gt; specification abuse.
&gt;
&gt; A much more useful way to go would be for the HTTP
&gt; authors not to have used bytes as the only units
&gt; for range headers.  If HTTP allowed range headers
&gt; to be specified in application units e.g. records,
&gt; then this would all be very easy.  Unfortunately,
&gt; they didn't and we have HTTP as it currently
&gt; stands.

Here are some variant protocols that I've thought about (see attached file). Wich seems the best to you ?
I. is the one proposed by Seairth Jacobs (if I've well understood :) and Paul Prescod as I remember.
what about the others ?
II or III. look more like SMTP
IV. loose the ability to modify the message after it was sent, but the receiver can get it even if the sender's server it offline.
an last variant can be that each client has its own http server, and sender POST to receiver directly, wich sounds more like P2P and IM (interesting, but its an other topic...  :)

Subject:ANN: Generating Python FSM/REST apps for Quixote<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm continuing my work with FSM (finite state machines) and REST. 
I'm now doing a more complete job of generating an FSM/REST
applications that runs on top of the Quixote Web application
framework.

I've implemented a harness (fsmGenerate.py) that reads an XML FSM
document and, from it, generates the following:

  - State definition modules -- These are Python modules that
    implement a Quixote application.  One module is generated for
    each state in the FSM.  Each generated module contains a class
    that implements the state.

  - An __init__.py file -- This file implements the dispatcher for
    the application.  It takes the current state name and calls the
    implementation of that state.

  - A states.py file -- This file contains a super class for the
    classes that implement the states in the FSM.

  - XML Schema files -- One file is generated for each state in the
    FSM.  And, these XML Schema files are used to generate a python
    parser for each XML interchange document and Python classes
    that represent the XML elements in each document.

  - A GUI definition file -- An XML definition file for a graphical
    user interface.  The interface definition can be edited with
    wxGlade graphical GUI editor.  wxGlade can also generate Python
    code that implements the user interface.  This code can be used
    in the implementation of client applications.  wxGlade
    generates Python code for wxPython.

I've picked FSM to work with because I feel that we need a
systematic way to work with and implement complex processes in a
REST-ful way.

This is not finished code or a shrink-wrap,
use-it-right-out-of-the-box product.  I view it more as code to
build upon.  And, the code that it generates requires editing: for
example, you will want to add application specific functionality. 
However, my tests show that it generates a reasonable skeleton of
an application.

A document describing this is available at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/fsmGenerate_howto.html

And, a file containing support code and examples is at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/fsmGenerate_examples.zip.

As usual, I am interested in comments and suggestions.  And, if you
would like help using this, please let me know.

<pre>&gt; Here are some variant protocols that I've thought about (see attached 
&gt; file).

Nice diagram.

&gt; Which seems the best to you ?

II, except that if the user agent wants to see a list of messages since
a given time (as opposed to all messages), then it should use a query
on inbox, for example:

     GET /host/address/inbox/?since="{server-provided date of last 
retrieval}"

Likewise, it is wise to define names within that space that represent
variations on the mailbox itself, so that someone can implement
fetchmail.  E.g.,

     GET /host/address/inbox/all
     DELETE /host/address/inbox/range?message=1-234

The most important thing to remember is that the names used by a
REST-based server do not need to reflect how the resources are
implemented.  The client must remain completely ignorant of the
implementation.

Note the use of /host/address above -- you should anticipate that
a single server might be used to handle messages for different MX
authorities and each authority will have its own way of assigning
mailbox accounts, so you want an unambiguous resource namespace.
It should not rely on things like the HTTP Host header field
because you don't want to limit the mailbox server to be on the
same IP address as the primary MX name.

Sorry, but you are wrong on both accounts. Read section 3.12
of RFC 2616.  In any case, a range request is not an appropriate
solution to this problem because it ties the client and server
implementations together.  If you don't care about that, then
just use rsync as your protocol.  It is more efficient.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

this is the documentation for a REST interface to a search engine I have been 
working on:

http://www.focuseek.com/en/searchbox/manual/restinterface.html

I'd appreciate any feedback you might have.

One glaring problem is the use of a "magic" cookie instead of a much more 
RESTful use of ETags, in the search index configuration. Unfortunately the 
REST interface is running as a CGI, and the CGI environment doesn't give me 
control at the If-Match stage. I'm planning on fixing this either by going 
the Apache module way, or by rolling a mini web server.

Other than general comments on RESTfullness, would you produce DTDs or schemas 
for the XML documents? (yeah, XML is not a requirement of REST, it's just a 
useful convention) Would you output more useful error documents instead of 
just e.g. "406 'query' parameter can't be null"?

I haven't had a chance to look at the rest of it, but I believe you are
using the 406 response incorrectly.  This is reserved to responding to
unrecognized Accept headers.  I suspect that 400 (bad request) would be a
better response here.

&gt; &gt;If you have more questions, please let me know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Since you invite questions, I do have a few.  I just read all of the 
&gt; above, as well as a considerable portion of the REST wiki.  I picked up 
&gt; some valuable insights, but I am not sure how some of my application 
&gt; could be implemented in a REST-ful way.  I would appreciate your insight 
&gt; about REST and how it solves (or doesn't solve) the problem below.
&gt; 
&gt; For example: a billing application that is implemented as a "wizard" -- 
&gt; a multi-page form, where each step in the process depends on the 
&gt; successful performance of previous steps. It also has the following 
&gt; constraints:
&gt; - Because the completion of the wizard has side-effects (e.g., the 
&gt; billing of a credit card), that final action must not take place unless 
&gt; all previous portions of the wizard have been completed in the same 
&gt; session.  As a corollary, the final action must not take place unless 
&gt; all previous steps have been completed.
&gt; - The application must be able to tell what sections of the wizard have 
&gt; been completed successfully, and save that information somehow for the 
&gt; completion of the wizard.  Even if someone bookmarks a page in the 
&gt; middle of the form and sends that URL to another person, the application 
&gt; must sense that a new session has started and transition back to the 
&gt; start stage.
&gt; 
&gt; You probably know the type of application that I am referring to... 
&gt; almost every online shop has something like it.  However, I cannot even 
&gt; think of a way to even define the application in a stateless (or at 
&gt; least idempotent) fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a solution to this problem?

Van -

Interesting problem.  And, a very realistic one, too.  Here are
some attempts at answers, but keep in mind that I am not a REST
expert.

First, I believe the claims about REST being state-less are very
misleading.  After all, the "S" in "REST" stands for "state".  The
server is state-less, but REST applications can have state.  It's
just that maintaining state is the responsibility of the client,
not the server.  Another way to say this is to say that the server
maintains no session information.

In the FSM/REST model that I use, state/session information is
returned from the server to the client in an XML document.  In the
subsequent request, the client returns this XML document to the
server.  So, state information is passed back and forth between
server and client.

I think you can see that the billing information could be passed
back and forth between the server and client (perhaps in an XML
document) until it is complete, error free, contains a valid credit
card number, etc.

Second, if as a requirement you are determined to keep the part of
the problem about a multi-part form and a multi-step process, then
something like the above, where state/session information is passed
back and forth between the client and server or even the FSM/REST
model I describe might be a solution.

But, third, let's leave the FSM/REST stuff aside, since that's a
little bit too much my own favorite solution. So, having said all
that, I believe that a serious REST developer might try to
re-design your application.  Again, I'm not a REST expert, but let
me try.  In your billing application, we'd define a resource,
perhaps called "Current billing request".  This resource might be
stored as a set of records in an relational database on the server. 
Once this resource has been created for a client, a URI for it
would be returned to the client.  The client could then request,
edit, and POST to this resource as many times as desired.  The
client does this by using the URI to request this resource and then
POST-ing changes against it.  At any time in this process, the
client can attempt to submit or attempt to complete the billing
request. It is the responsibility of the server to only perform
this action if the billing information is complete, free from
errors, etc.  Once it has been submitted successfully, the server
removes the "Current billing request" resource, creates a
"Submitted billing" resource, and returns a URI to the client for
that new resource.

I think what we have done in this re-design, is to take what we
might have called state, and turned it into a (temporary?)
resource.

A few additional comments -- It might be the case that there is a
requirement that the implementation follow an existing business
process (BP) closely.  The type of redesign work I've suggested
might, therefore, be objectionable.  I can especially imagine this
requirement if the BP is very complex, in which case a business
analyst might want, for example, to be able to check the
implementation for correctness by comparing it to the (back-end)
BP.  Well, my work with FSMs and REST is an attempt to address that
issue.  FSM/REST is an attempt to enable developers to expose
complex processes as REST-ful Web applications, just as long as the
BP can be modeled as an FSM, which, I suppose, might require some
re-design work itself (sigh).

And, going back and trying to get more into the spirit of your
example application with its multi-part process and multi-part
form: perhaps each part of the multi-part form could be a separate
resource which the client could retrieve and post updates to.  At
the bottom of each page returned to the client is the URI of the
next part/page of the form to be edited and POST-ed.  And, there
would also be a URI that the client could request in order to
submit the billing.  Again, it is up to the server app to check
these resources for errors and completeness before submitting the
request to the credit card company.

Did I get anywhere close to a solution to your problem?

Thanks for the provocative example.

I'd like to post your example problem/application and my reply to
the REST email list.  (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/)
Would that be OK?  Maybe someone there will have better ideas than
mine.  It's certainly a problem that we'd need a good solution too
if REST is going to be taken seriously.

&gt; &gt;Did I get anywhere close to a solution to your problem?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'm not sure, I have to think about it.  Right off had, there are some 
&gt; issues that come to mind:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Never trust the client.  I know that you can cryptographically sign 
&gt; the encoded state, and check signatures, but I worry that embedding the 
&gt; state in the request opens up Pandora's box a little too much.

One way to respond to this is to ask:  Does this kind of design
enable the the server to be careful enough?  Does it enable the
server to perform checks that make the application safe?  I think
it does.  But, that does place burden on the developer of the
server application, and I agree that you're justified in being
concerned about that.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. The additional encoding-decoding of state is additional overhead that 
&gt; would not be required, should the state be kept server-side.

The alternative, maintaining session information on the server
requires cycles and storage, too.

And, unless your session requirements are simple, session
management takes human (development) cycles as well.  A company I
used to work for developed a tool where we had to worry about when
sessions expired, about enabling customers to control the
expiration of sessions, about whether sessions could be maliciously
captured from another machine, etc.

&gt; 
&gt; 3. In the design you mention, the URI does not completely embody the 
&gt; state of the app - it is a combination of URI+embedded/encoded state.  
&gt; I'm not sure that this is a problem, but if (my admittedly poor) 
&gt; understanding of the REST rules is correct, it is a violation.

Let me try to clarify what this design does, then we can decide
whether it is consistent with or violates REST:

  1. The client has a URI that identifies a resource.

  2. The client makes requests to the URI and with the request the
    client submits input items (possibly some state information). 
    In the design I've suggested, the input is in an XML document
    that is POST-ed with the request.

  3. The server may be "building" resources as the client makes
    requests.  For example, the server may be building a client
    record or a billing record.

So, let's ask: In what way does this violate REST?

Posting data to a URI is consistent with REST.

Updating a back-end resource from posted data is consistent with
REST.  Although, I'll admit that the idempotent requirement
mystifies me.

And, returning content as a result of a request is consistent with
REST.

But, I'll admit that the whole idea of state and doing FSM in a
REST-ful style is questionable.  Perhaps it pushes the REST
envelope.

&gt; 
&gt; I brought up this billing app, but the problem is much more general -- I 
&gt; think that any app that undertakes an action that has side-effects is 
&gt; going to encounter this sort of issue.

Looks like the essential requirements for the problem are:

  1. The application is a multi-step process.  Filling out a
    multi-part form (as in your billing application) is a specific
    problem, but the problem is more general.

  2. Individual steps in the application have side-effects.  What's
    more, these side-effects may have consequences for subsequenct
    steps.  In particular, a subsequent step may need to be blocked
    (or performed differently) depending on the side-effect from a
    previous step.

As I've tried to describe, I believe that these can be done in a
(mostly) REST-ful way.  And, my goal is to do it as REST-fully as
possible.  Perhaps REST purists would object.

And, thanks for getting me to think about these things.  I'm going
to go back and review the way in which I'm doing FSM/REST to see if
I can use some of your ideas and comments (and my replies) to
improve it, possibly making it more REST-ful.

&gt; Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; One final note.  In his thesis, Roy Fielding attacks cookies as 
&gt; particularly breaking REST principles.  However, in the redesign that 
&gt; you proposed, you note that the state is passed back and forth between 
&gt; the two actors as an XML page.  How is that different in design or 
&gt; intent than a cookie that gets 'passed back and forth' representing state? 

I just read the section of the thesis complaining about cookies
("6.3.4.2 Cookies").  I don't understand it too well, myself, but I
don't think it should be taken as objecting to sending content back
and forth between server and client.  That, after all, is what HTTP
was intended for.  Fielding's objections to cookies seem to have to
do with (1) they are hidden/opaque; (2) once set, they apply to all
future request to the same site; and (3) that they cause security
problems.

One comment from that section:

    "The same functionality should have been accomplished via anonymous
    authentication and true client-side state."

seems to indicate that what I'm suggesting *is* the right way,
specifically, asking the client to maintain and return state
information.  But, I'd better try to find out what *true*
client-side state is.

&gt; 
&gt; XML exchange
&gt; Client  sends to server XML document, representing state
&gt; 
&gt; Cookie
&gt; Client sends to server XML+Cookie, representing state
&gt; 
&gt; Once again, I'm just not sure how the principles work.

You are right.  Cookies and (XML) content are analogous, but
different.  Cookies seem hidden (opaque).  I'm in favor of
exchanging explicit content.

&gt; 
&gt; Finally, it seems to me that there is a lot of overlap between the ideas 
&gt; of functional language design and REST web app design.  The governing 
&gt; principle in both cases seems to be that the state is both passed into 
&gt; returned from the function (URI), and that there are no side-effects.  
&gt; Thus, pass in the same state+input, you get the same result -- always.  
&gt; In functional languages, you need to explicitly pass in the state of the 
&gt; application, if any state changes are required.  Without a mechanism 
&gt; like cookies, though, (or XML transfer, see note above) how do you pass 
&gt; in the necessary state to accomplish the change?  Finally, as I noted in 
&gt; my last email, how do you deal with the side-effects that may occur 
&gt; because of outside interactions?
&gt; 
&gt; What makes web apps particularly hard is that every state that you make 
&gt; URI-accessible, you have to make a posibble starting state as well.  I 
&gt; think this is the strongest of the RPCer's arguments: by having a single 
&gt; entrance point (URI), you get much better control over the execution of 
&gt; the app.

You might want to notice that in the FSM/REST model I'm suggesting,
there is a single URI for the entire FSM (but, the state changes).

----- Original Message -----
From: "Dave Kuhlman" &lt;dkuhlman@...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; First, I believe the claims about REST being state-less are very
&gt; misleading.  After all, the "S" in "REST" stands for "state".  The
&gt; server is state-less, but REST applications can have state.
The term 'stateless' shouldn't be applied to REST or applications build in
that style. HTTP as a protocol is called a 'stateless' protocol, because the
interpretation of any individual message is independent of any preceding
message.

&gt; It's
&gt; just that maintaining state is the responsibility of the client,
&gt; not the server.  Another way to say this is to say that the server
&gt; maintains no session information.
If your application or business logic requires the concept of 'sessions',
then model those sessions as resources &amp; you should be fine. Think of it as
a 'working session' rather than 'protocol session ticket' or something. You
should be able to set down your 'work in progress' &amp; pick it up later - even
from a different client.

&gt;
&gt; In the FSM/REST model that I use, state/session information is
&gt; returned from the server to the client in an XML document.  In the
&gt; subsequent request, the client returns this XML document to the
&gt; server.  So, state information is passed back and forth between
&gt; server and client.
If the resources involved are coarse-grained 'entry-points', then this is
more of a custom message-passing system, rather than using the built in
primitive/generic operations upon resources. The state information passed
should be a representation of a resource. The content should exclude
identification of any logical resource that the server should apply the
information against.

&gt;
&gt; I think you can see that the billing information could be passed
&gt; back and forth between the server and client (perhaps in an XML
&gt; document) until it is complete, error free, contains a valid credit
&gt; card number, etc.
Yes, this sounds very reasonable. I'd be interested to know the
visible/addressable resource model involved.

&gt;
&gt; I think what we have done in this re-design, is to take what we
&gt; might have called state, and turned it into a (temporary?)
&gt; resource.
I would approach it in the same way- but perhaps did you mean 'turn session
into a resource'.

Tim O'Reilly gives some insights on web services usage at Amazon:

Here is the interesting part:

"Amazon has both SOAP and REST interfaces to their web services, and 85% 
of their usage is of the REST interface."

That is a very convincing case for REST in such an environment.

Advantages and challenges of each style are compared and integration
examples are reviewed in the context of the Sun TM Open Net Environment (Sun

Subject:ROPE: ReST Oriented Programming Environments<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I was thinking about the history of programming
lately with respect to ReST.

In the beginning there was procedural programming.
With procedural programming, there was a single
object, the computer that was assumed to process
large numbers of methods/procedures/verbs.
Procedural programming ended up with scaling
problems because it provided no obvious way of
managing this proliferation of methods each taking
their own arguments and each requiring substantial
documentation/training to understand their
operation.

Object oriented programming attempted to address
this problem by associating methods with
particular object classe.  The hope was that the
methods of any particular object class would be
obvious because if you understood the nature of
the object you would have to understand what it
did.  In practice, this worked better than
procedural programming but it never worked
prticularly well.  Object modeling was never
obvious.  Guessing what methods of an object did
was always a dangerous proposition.  Objects still
ended up proliferating methods requiring the
user to traverse a complex object model to
understand a system.  Object orienged programming
failed to scale.

ReST programming takes this evolution further.
Where OOP created a relatively small number of
object classes, ReST creates many.  Where OOP
reduced the number of methods per object
moderately, ReST reduces them drastically.
Although we largely have been discussing ReST in
terms of web architecture, there is no obvious
reason why those design principles should not
apply equally well within smaller scale
programming contexts.

The transition to OOP resulted in new programming
languages specifically designed to support that
style of programming.  Is anyone working on a
ReST Oriented Programming Environments?

Such an environemnt could automatically handle
most of the housekeeping associated with GET/PUT.
It could reduce the total language syntax
immensely.  It could handle mapping operations
onto web servers if they are destined for public
visibility,etc.

Here is a strawman implementation of RESTLog:

  class Blog (Collection):
	Representation: RSS
	POST RSS-Item: OK
  publish Blog /path/to/blog

For things that are more complex and require some
actual logic beyond simply having a ReST
architecture e.g. database access

  class Blog (Collection):
	Representation: RSS
	GET: text/xml+rss
 	SQL databaseconnection:
		Select columns from table
		map in some standard way to RSS format
  	GET: text/html default
		xslt-URL

...

This is all completely a strawman.  My question is
whether anyone is doing anything like this?

Subject:GET with complex parameters<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm modeling a search engine in Rest. Queries are more complex than just a
list of keywords, and should be represented in xml. So my question is: how
could I send the query to the server ?
The obvious solution would be a POST, but as it is a search, GET would be
more convenient?
An other solution could be:
    C: POST http://my.server.com/queries/
    S: 201 Created
         Location: http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234
    C: GET
http://my.server.com/results?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234
    or even
    C: GET
http://some.other-server.org/search?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queri
es/1234
but I'd like to avoid to much round trip

May be a redirect to the GETed adress instead of the 201 created whould be
the solution ?
(Other GETs can be done on this address without side effect).

The problem here is that the server has to manager "saved" queries, and to
delete them (when ???)

Any ideas ?

I agree that this seems to be too much for simple search engine queries, OTH
I think it is a good idea to create a new resource for the 'information 
retrieval interaction', because it opens up the possibility for more complex
retrieval tasks: You could distribute the URI of that resource to various
'information retrieval systems/agents' that can GET the query parameters from
it and POST the results to it. At any time, you could do a GET on the resource
to see the current 'retrieval state', much like you can GET the state of a
shipping order to track the delivery.

I am curious: How do your queries look like?

Not as such to the best of my knowledge.

But if you squint really hard, you might notice that REST has an awful 
lot in common with the programming model implicit in the pi-calculus 
... the key point is to think of a URI in REST corresponding to the 
name of a communication channel in pi.

I think the most interesting aspect of the comparison is that REST's 
most powerful idiom (passing continuation/capability URIs in 
request/response entities) carries over directly to pi (names of 
channels can be passed over channels).

There are a few experimental programming languages modelled on pi which 
you might enjoy playing with. They might also be a source of 
inspiration for anyone interested in putting together a full-blown REST 
toolkit. PICT and Nomadic PICT are probably the most interesting ... 
implementations for Linux available here,

Interesting paper on pi-calculus. (I wonder if an arc could be a channel?)

&lt;quote&gt;The models are based on a new mathematical structure which

That's a bit cryptic for someone like me who knows virtually nothing 
about Topic Maps ... care to elaborate?

My wild guess is that the answer is "maybe" but only with a bit of 
reinterpretation of TM. In pi, channels link processes. In TM I suppose 
arcs relate topics. So, if it makes any kind of sense to think of a 
topic as a process, there might be a corrspondance between arcs and 
channels.

convenient? You mean more RESTful? I think the names of verbs is pure
ideology. It's the ideas that count. If POST works better for pure
technical reasons, use POST.

Best would be probably a hidden field, name "method" or so that really
indicates what you wanted. You need to have it for PUT/DELETE anyway.

Yup.

Yup.

NB, I think pi gets overlooked a lot because people think it's all

Cf. Piccola instead.  Much more approachable for most of the folks who

Maybe a better way to look at it is to consider the impact of one choice 
over the other.

For instance, if you use DELETE /container to delete the contents of the 
container, then what will you use to delete the container itself?  If 
DELETEing the container is something that doesnt make sense in your 
application, then it may be OK.  What do you use to create the container?

Personally, I don't see a problem doing it either way - as long as the 
semantics of the DELETE operation for you application are made clear, 
are consistent, and aren't in conflict with what most people would 
construe delete to mean.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] DELETE container?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I think the general question here is what are the
standard ReST semantics for container.  It feels
like we loop through this periodically on this
list but never resolve it generically.  Here are
the questions that should be in the FAQ (I don't
know the answers).

1. How do you create a container?
  Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?
  Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,
   a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?

2. How do we add things to the container?
  Do we rely on directory structure and just do
   a PUT /collection/item?
  Do we POST /collection and get back a 201 CREATED?

3. How do we specify the order of items in a collection?
  If we do this by POSTing to the collection, how
  do we disambiguate between an add-to-collection
  POST and an "order-by" POST.

4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?
  My answer: DELETE /container

5. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and not
  its contents?
  My answer: Make it a container of links (see #4)

6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?
  My answer: Either iterate through the contents
  and DELETE individually or DELETE the container
  and then create it again but then see #1

Some people may want to argue that these choices
are application specific, but to the extent they
are, it would be useful to know what the standard
choices are.   Part of the point of ReST is to
reduce the amount of prior knowledge you need to
interact with any resource.  Standard patterns for
these things would be helpful.

I don't disagree with the intent of the question, but shouldnt the 
question really be "what are the standard _HTTP_ semantics for a 
container?"  As far as I know, REST (as described in Fielding's thesis) 
says nothing about the concept of containers; it only talks about 
resources in general.  (The closest it comes is a statement that a 
resource may be a collection of other resources).

I've found the following heuristics useful; if the life

parent, then kill the child when the parent is killed.
Otherwise, don't.

In order to kill off independant children, I'd be tempted
to use DAV's "Depth" feature on a delete to delete the
childen.  But I've never implemented that.

In WebDAV, DELETE is always "deep". There's no way to delete a collection
without it's children, because it would result in a DAV-inconsistent
namespace

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] DELETE container?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; I think the general question here is what are the
&gt; standard ReST semantics for container.  It feels
&gt; like we loop through this periodically on this
&gt; list but never resolve it generically.  Here are
&gt; the questions that should be in the FAQ (I don't
&gt; know the answers).

Well, for one, it is REST -- not ReST.  I like uniformity in some
things.

&gt; 1. How do you create a container?
&gt;   Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?
&gt;   Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,
&gt;    a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?

Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,
as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav
implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to
a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes
such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.

REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the
method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources
(even if some may not allow it).

&gt; 2. How do we add things to the container?
&gt;   Do we rely on directory structure and just do
&gt;    a PUT /collection/item?

If you know that item os the name you want, yes.

&gt;   Do we POST /collection and get back a 201 CREATED?

If you don't know what the name should be, yes.

&gt; 3. How do we specify the order of items in a collection?
&gt;   If we do this by POSTing to the collection, how
&gt;   do we disambiguate between an add-to-collection
&gt;   POST and an "order-by" POST.

Order is a property of the collection representation.

&gt; 4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?
&gt;   My answer: DELETE /container

That is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.
The server might tell you to delete the children first.

&gt; 5. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and not
&gt;   its contents?
&gt;   My answer: Make it a container of links (see #4)

Move the contents first.

&gt; 6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?
&gt;   My answer: Either iterate through the contents
&gt;   and DELETE individually or DELETE the container
&gt;   and then create it again but then see #1

If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other
links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,
then you should not delete the container unless you want all of
those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.

BTW, why do you switch from "collection" to "container"?

&gt; Best would be probably a hidden field, name "method" or so that really
&gt; indicates what you wanted. You need to have it for PUT/DELETE anyway.
Not for pure-automation approaches where you go beyond a classic web
browser.

It's not harmful to retrieve via POST, just not optimal. But it is harmful
to modify via GET. So the method names are not merely ideology.

Let me see if I understand this correctly yet:

Say I have a container of products...
http://example.com/products
...containing individual products e.g....
http://example.com/products/productA
http://example.com/products/productB
...etc.

And then I have another collection:
http://example.com/topTenProducts/productB
...etc.

Would I need to move the products under topTenProducts before I 
DELETE the topTenProducts collection because 
http://example.com/topTenProducts/productB is a different resource 
than http://example.com/products/productB ?

Even though they are the same product?  And that the 
physical "resource" behind the covers is the same?

Is there a name in REST-speak for that physical thing behind the 
covers that is the same?

(Or am I still thinking incorrectly about this REST stuff?)

Thanks.

&gt; than http://example.com/products/productB ?

I think I can answer the REST part of this: If you are the authority
at example.com, and you assert/enforce that /topTenProducts/productB
and /products/productB are two names for the same resource, then
that's exactly what you have: two names, one resource.

Sameness = identity = resource; that much is clear.

What happens to a resource that appears (by virtue of being
named) in multiple containers when a container is deleted
is not so clear  But I don't think REST covers that either, at
least not yet.  (It might be fun and useful to model containment
semantics.)

But I can synthesize the following argument.  If DELETE on a
container is interpreted to mean 'deep delete', such that it implies
DELETE on all (recursively) contained resources, then any
resource contained will be zapped, regardless of whether it
was contained elsewhere as well.  This should be true in any
situation where a resource has multiple names, regardless of
any containment semantics or absence of same.  For instance,
if /a and /b denote the same resource, and 'DELETE /a' happens,
then 'GET /b' should result in 'not found'.

That's my understanding.  Could somebody please check that
and correct me where/if I've gone astray?

hard links - you can keep deleting them until the last one is gone.

Existing but empty. Hmm. What does the representation of an empty 
container look like? Does it even have a representation? I'd say that if 
it has a representation then this would be somewhat confusing, but not 
altogether wrong; it would be as if the container had magically been 
created immediately after deletion.

This sounds like an implementation convenience question - is the 
requirement to provide a simple way of deleting all the contained 
resources. I'd suggest an alternative container which also contains all 
the resources

/container?id=*

Then you could DELETE this, which would also delete all the contained 
resources. But you would not have removed the /container resource. Any 
further requests to /container?id=* at this point should get 404 Not 
Found (or is 410 Gone better?), until the /container is non empty.

This seems clearer to me because I get the behaviour I'd expect on the 
alternative container - when DELETED it is gone. And the /container 
resource is still there, ready to accept POST (or whatever really) in 
the future.

Remember that we are talking about a protocol that transfers

the capability of conjuring up representations.

It's more like my decision to answer your question or not,

This topic is a rathole;  let's stay out.  Thread should be about

OK, I admit I was being a little fanciful about the hard link idea. My
(re) reading of RFC 2616 leads me to beleive that DELETE works against
the resource itself. Therefore if there are multiple representations
(and multiple URI for that resource) then I'd expect they should all
be deleted by the request - though the RFC is not explicit on this point.

I vaguely recall an earlier discussion about DELETE and content
negotiaon - if its relevant anyone care to summarise?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Following on from the recent thread which discussed modelling a multi
page form submission process using REST principles, I'm wondering if
there is any place at all for the use of cookies in a REST style http
application?

It seems clear that cookies should not be used to store hidden state,
states should be exposed in the request URI. This seems to preclude
the use of cookies in this context.

Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication
mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most
user agents give application designers over the standard http
authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login
prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the
issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?

Subject:URLs are not containers! (was Re: DELETE container?)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I think the premise of this discussion is
incorrect.  A URL is not a container.
Relationships between URLs are entirely client and
application driven.  If you think that one URL
contains another, specify that in some RDF
document.  And when you do, you need need to
precisely specify the meaning of this containment
relation:

1. Does deleting a container without first
   deleting its contents result in a 50x error?
2. Does deleting a container also delete all of
   its contents and disable any further
   GET/POSTs to the URL?
3. Does deleting a container simply empty its
   contents but allow further GET/POSTs to
   the URL?
[Note: these are equivalent to the issue of
referential integrity and cascading deletes from
the RDBMS world]

DELETEing a URL should simply mean that you can no
longer GET or POST to it.  Adding arbitrary side
effects just makes it more complex to interact
with your application.

Note: It would be great to solve the referential
integrity problem for the web, but I think that
goes WAYYY beyond the scope of this discussion.

Note: If you don't want the overhead of
downloading all the URLs in the collection and
deleting them one by one, you probably need the
container to handle a POST whose body is "delete
contents."  But handling this sort of message is
really an optimization and all the warnings about
optimizations apply here.

&gt; I'm not sure about this (I'm not sure about anything, but especially
&gt; this).  DELETE seems to work against the mapping of resource to
&gt; representations, not against the mapping of identifier(s) to resources,
&gt; as would be the case above.
&gt;
&gt; The linking and unlinking of identifiers to resources seems to be
&gt; solely in the domain of the authority, not something exposed through

&gt; &gt;   My answer: DELETE /container
&gt;
&gt; That is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.
&gt; The server might tell you to delete the children first.

This is actually related to the question I didn't
ask.  What happens when you GET a container?  I
think that GET on a container isn't standardized
because, again, HTTP URLs are not defined to have
containment relations.  I think for WebDAV to
specify DELETE in this context without
constraining GET is weird.

Note: If GET were specified on a containe, we
wouldn't need index.html files.

&gt; BTW, why do you switch from "collection" to "container"?

We are talking implicitly about containment
relationships.  A directory contains other files,
it does not collect them.

Note: If you want to use collection, then I would
observe that to delete a name for the collection
is not to delete the members of the collection.

And to DELETE a URL is really only to DELETE a
name.

It doesn't?  Once DELETE &lt;URL&gt; succeeds, &lt;URL&gt;
no longer designates the location of a resource.
Further use of &lt;URL&gt; should result in a 404 or 410

I'd say it's still a URL. It just doesn't have a mapped representation

The model I posted was extremely abstract, as you may recall,
treating "function" in the relational sense of a mapping, which we
understood to represent a state transition for some resource or
another.  There's no expressive power in a model like that for the
concept of parallel state transitions on other resources, all wrapped
up in a single operation.

In short, yes, by dint of minimal expressiveness.

Huh?  index.html files are an implementation mechanism for providing
a representation for the ancestor/ name, which most people call a
collection (of names).  That is not a container.

&gt;&gt; BTW, why do you switch from "collection" to "container"?
&gt;
&gt; We are talking implicitly about containment
&gt; relationships.  A directory contains other files,
&gt; it does not collect them.

You used both words interchangeably.  Traditionally, a container is a
storage component that contains other addressable items, whereas a
collection is a list of addressable items independent of storage.
Containers are represented by an aggregation of its contents.
A collection is represented by a list of names and related information.

In REST, a "directory" can be presented as two different resources --
container or collection -- only by providing different identifiers
for each purpose.

&gt; Note: If you want to use collection, then I would
&gt; observe that to delete a name for the collection
&gt; is not to delete the members of the collection.
&gt;
&gt; And to DELETE a URL is really only to DELETE a
&gt; name.

More assumptions about the implementation.  The method only signifies
the action desired by the user agent.  How that is accomplished is left
to the server implementation.  Some implementations will have garbage
collection, others will delete on last reference removed, and still
others will refuse a delete until the namespace is empty.  In any case,
the client cannot delete the URI -- it can only see and manipulate the
representation, and all it expects from the origin server is that the
old representation is no longer available once the DELETE succeeds.

the two representations (before and after the DELETE) are not the same?

From: "sem_antico" &lt;rest-discuss@...&gt;

&gt; Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication
&gt; mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most
&gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http
&gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login
&gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the
&gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?

If one of the REST principles is visibility into messages for key
information - like authentication - then moving authentication out of the
standard header and into custom cookies would then violate this aspect.

I found a Note on the W3C site about extending HTML FORM with authentication
information - this would allow application authors to declare their usage of
authentication in a way that provides control over the user experience as
well as allowing the user-agent to correctly translate that into protocol
level authentication.

Remember that for web services the existing model is not really
broken. 

It's only really broken in the way browsers work and the way
most marketing managers want the application to do authentication.

It's my belief that basic authentication could be fixed as a device
for doing web authentication if the user agents always displayed the
entity from the server.

&gt; for doing web authentication if the user agents always displayed the
&gt; entity from the server.

Except that entity already has a use:  to be displayed if the user hits the
cancel button.  An alternative might be to provide a new response header
during challenges that points a browser to a server-defined skin (possibly
using the technique S. Mike found in the W3C Note).  Newer browsers that
recognized the header would  be able to give a more "polished" look, while
older browsers would continue working without problem.

You misunderstand me.

When a user requests a protected resource the server can send back an
entity body with the initial 401. The rfc says that the entity is for
when the response fails - but that should only happen after a
challenge has been sent. 

Therefore, if browsers displayed any entity body sent by the server
when no challenge has been sent the entity body could be used to
provide a "normal" authentication FORM (ie: a username and password
POSTing to some place).

In other words the entity body from the server replaces the login
dialog box for the user.

This would fit in with the way most web applications want to do
authentication and it's REST compliant (as far as I can see).

Yep.

Any application of cookies breaks REST, because they are by definition
stateful, and all REST interactions are stateless.  That doesn't mean
they don't have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of doing
"sessions" statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.

At least three frequently asked questions are contained in that

1. Cookies vs REST?
2. Sessions vs REST?
3. What does REST mean by "stateless"?

#1 &amp; #2 of course are closely related.
#3 has a larger range.  

I added those questions to the rest-wiki FAQ page.  Without answers, 
since I don't really feel qualified to sort out the various confused

Good answers would be a blessing.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] DELETE container?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The question here is whether the availability of
HTTP resources are dependent or independent on
resources higher than them in the HTTP URI path
hierarchy.  e.g. whether:

  DELETE /parent

implies anything about how the server should then
respond to:

  GET /parent/child

RFC2396 says:
  URI that are hierarchical in nature use the
  slash "/" character for separating
  hierarchical components. For some file systems,
  a "/" character (used to denote the hierarchical
  structure of a URI) is the delimiter used to
  construct a file name hierarchy, and thus the URI
  path will look similar to a file pathname.
  This does NOT imply that the resource is a file
  or that the URI maps to an actual filesystem pathname.

So the semantics of the hierarchical relationship
are dependent on the scheme (or perhaps even the
implementation) and are not specified by RFC2396.

RFC 2616 (HTTP), says:

  As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource
  Identifiers are simply formatted strings which
  identify--via name, location, or any other
  characteristic--a resource.

Since RFC2616 makes no specific reference to
resource hierarchies or containers, this language
would imply that hierarchy means very little in
HTTP and therefore the default assumption for HTTP
should be Resource Independence.

Roy argues that it is the Implementor's Choice;
that resource dependence is up to the implementor.
If the resource is defined as a container of
addressable elements, DELETEing the resource would
DELETE its contents.  OTOH, if the resource is
defined to be a collection, DELETEing the resource
would affect only those applications that view the
other resources as a collection.

The problem with Implementor's Choice is that no
RFC specifies that being higher in the path
hierarchy of an HTTP URL implies either a
collection or container relationship with the
those lower down.  As such, any implementation of
resource dependence is really an imeplementation
with large non-standard side-effects.

So, given that a major REST design principle is to
make the effects of all methods as predictable as
possible, HTTP-REST applications SHOLD implement
resource independence rather than resource
dependence.

Note: Resource independence does not prohibit an
application from prohibiting deletes until some
other set of resources are deleted.  It only
prohibits non-standard side-effects associated
with allowing a DELETE to succeed.

Note 2: A further syntactic argument against
Resource Dependence is that the side effects of a
DELETE with a query string become extremely
unpredictable, but I think such an argument is
unnessary given the above.

just to be clear, while i think this reduces the RESTfulness of an app,

Not really.  Cookies aren't the state, they're "receipts" for the state.
e.g. if you login to a web site using cookies, your browser just gets an
opaque string which represents your login information.  It's your login
info which is the state.  Subsequent interactions are called "stateful"
because the meaning of the message depends upon state which is not
present in the message, requiring parties wanting to process those
messages to already know how to lookup the login/password info given
the cookie.

yes.

the representations generated can differ depending on whether there is

before you can buy stuff' or whatever.

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;


Are there any known techiques for RESTfully updating RDF documents?  I suspect one could use POST to add/updated individual statements.  Or is there any way to use PUT plus a query string to "directly" update statements?  How about removal of individual statements? In order to remove *all* statements, could I do something like:

DELETE /rdf/1?http://anothersite.invalid/somepath

&gt;
&gt; i don't think so.
&gt;
&gt; however the reality of contemporary user agents dictates a more
&gt; pragmatic approach.  (IMHO of course).

Yes, for current implementations.  Eventually, someone points
out the security hole and some poor sap is assigned to make the browser
compliant with one or more standards, and suddenly they find out that
a raft of user-reported errors just go away.

&gt; i will take two examples where i have had to use cookies as keys to
&gt; server-side session state:
&gt; 1. shopping cart.
&gt; 2. authentication.
&gt;
&gt; it seems to me that early web/REST people may have thought shopping
&gt; carts would be handled as client side state, and be all posted to an
&gt; /orders resource or whatever at the end.  however this isn't the
&gt; reality of how client UAs work.

That can be fixed.  Back in the really old days, all of the people who
were actually working on the Web implementations would talk about this
kind of thing on www-talk and it would be implemented by half the
browsers before the day ended.  Now such a suggestion would be tabled
within the W3C and two years later they would figure out which working
group has the appropriate right and W3C representation to work on the
topic, and two years after that we would have two different
recommendations based on technologies that none of the browsers 
implement.

&gt;&gt; Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication
&gt;&gt; mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most
&gt;&gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http
&gt;&gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login
&gt;&gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the
&gt;&gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?
&gt;
&gt; i think so.
&gt;
&gt; as mentioned by others, user agents need to display the entity returned
&gt; by the server.  i would say they also need to supply 'log out' UI and
&gt; make the current authentication status highly visible and obvious.

Yes, that would be the correct fix.  Note that this is a well-known
security hole in browsers that has been consistently reported since
1993, and yet no one ever fixed it.  Probably because Netscape and MSIE
were too busy battling over blink and marquee tags.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt;&gt; Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,
&gt;&gt; as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav
&gt;&gt; implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to
&gt;&gt; a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes
&gt;&gt; such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the
&gt;&gt; method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources
&gt;&gt; (even if some may not allow it).
&gt;
&gt; But does HTTP happily accept either alternative?  Or does HTTP
&gt; standarize on one or the other method?

HTTP doesn't tell applications how to do a sequence of actions.
It only defines what each action means and how the client should
interpret the response to each action.  WebDAV is a little more
explicit about sequences, which is why it prefers MKCOL and would
probably reject a deep PUT.

&gt;&gt; If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other
&gt;&gt; links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,
&gt;&gt; then you should not delete the container unless you want all of
&gt;&gt; those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.
&gt;
&gt; What do you mean by "the server automatically maintains links?"

Many content management products (like Day Software's Communique)
include an automatic link maintenance function that will recognize
a delete on a resource and either note all links to it as being
broken (and thus scheduled for review) or simply deactivate those
links so that they don't show up on the published pages until someone
either changes the destination or restores the deleted resource.

/parent is not an ancestor resource.  /parent/ is.

&gt; RFC2396 says:
&gt;   URI that are hierarchical in nature use the
&gt;   slash "/" character for separating
&gt;   hierarchical components. For some file systems,
&gt;   a "/" character (used to denote the hierarchical
&gt;   structure of a URI) is the delimiter used to
&gt;   construct a file name hierarchy, and thus the URI
&gt;   path will look similar to a file pathname.
&gt;   This does NOT imply that the resource is a file
&gt;   or that the URI maps to an actual filesystem pathname.
&gt;
&gt; So the semantics of the hierarchical relationship
&gt; are dependent on the scheme (or perhaps even the
&gt; implementation) and are not specified by RFC2396.

No, the slash character is not dependent on the scheme.  It is not
allowed to appear in any URI that does not treat the slash as being a
hierarchical separator.  That includes "http" URIs.

&gt; RFC 2616 (HTTP), says:
&gt;
&gt;   As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource
&gt;   Identifiers are simply formatted strings which
&gt;   identify--via name, location, or any other
&gt;   characteristic--a resource.

which says nothing about this discussion.

&gt; Since RFC2616 makes no specific reference to
&gt; resource hierarchies or containers, this language
&gt; would imply that hierarchy means very little in
&gt; HTTP and therefore the default assumption for HTTP
&gt; should be Resource Independence.

Huh?  HTTP is dependent on RFC 2396.  Every restriction in 2396
is an absolute requirement on 2616.

&gt; Roy argues that it is the Implementor's Choice;
&gt; that resource dependence is up to the implementor.

No, I did not.  What I said was that making assumptions about the
implementation is strictly not allowed in REST.  Therefore, much
of what you were arguing simply does not apply.

&gt; If the resource is defined as a container of
&gt; addressable elements, DELETEing the resource would
&gt; DELETE its contents.  OTOH, if the resource is
&gt; defined to be a collection, DELETEing the resource
&gt; would affect only those applications that view the
&gt; other resources as a collection.

No, that is completely confused.  The method defines what the user
agent intends in regards to the identifier name space.  How the server
accomplishes that is none of the user agent's business.  DELETE'ing
a hierarchical ancestor is a request to delete the entire name space.
There is no other choice.  The only issue is whether a server should
require that the child name space be empty before allowing the DELETE
to succeed, and that choice is left to the server.  The client must
be prepared to handle a 4xx response.  The server cannot respond with
a 2xx response unless the entire name space is deleted.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST, HTTP, Sessions and Cookies<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; Any application of cookies breaks REST, because they are by definition
&gt; stateful, and all REST interactions are stateless.  That doesn't mean
&gt; they don't have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of doing
&gt; "sessions" statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.

That concept tends to be a little confusing, partly because HTTP,
like many network protocols, has a notion of stateless interactions
that only refers to having all of the information needed to
understand each request inside the request or defined by universal
standard.  REST goes further and constrains application state
(not resource state) to be held on the client.  It is hard to
describe without further defining what "application" means, but
we can think of it as the context between user agent requests:
the server cannot be aware of any such context and still be REST.

This is also what allows individual pages to be bookmarked and
shared with others, but that's a longer story.

The purpose of statelessness is to prevent partial failures and
allow for substrate independence (e.g., load-balanced gateways
managing the traffic for many servers).  Cookies don't
necessarily break that because they are inside the request,
unless developers make the mistake of defining the cookie such
that it varies by gateway.

Most of the problems with cookies are due to breaking visibility,
which impacts caching and the hypertext application engine, but
even worse is its use for authentication, as evidenced by the
cross-site-scripting security holes in sites that use it.
It ends up being a weird trade-off of security versus efficiency.

Using cookies is more efficient than authentication because the
server (and intermediaries) will simply ignore cookies for the
vast majority of URI (e.g., inline images).  That allows everything
except the pages that set cookies to be cacheable, and those are
typically non-cacheable pages in any case.  However, using cookies
in that fashion means the server is relying on security by obscurity
to associate the client's stored cookie with the application state
(attackers ability to guess the cookie or obtain it illegitimately
via XSS).  Likewise, keeping state in the cookie means that the
URIs can be independent of the user state, but doing that messes-up
the client's understanding of state as presented by the hypertext
engine: it breaks the "back" button.

Unfortunately, cookies were not presented for discussion by the
community until after they had been deployed and announced as one
of Netscape's infamous "extensions".  If they had, then it is more
likely that HTML would have been extended to indicate selectable
items, and browsers could then have developed a client-side
market basket that is more reliable and subject to a fancier UI.
Doing that now is simply a chicken-and-egg problem: browers won't
bother til there is user demand for the feature, and sites won't
offer it as an option until browsers implement it consistently.
Java was supposed to solve that problem, but Sun screwed that up.

Cookies that simply store a reference to server-maintained state
do violate REST's constraint on state being stored on the client,
rather than the server, for scalability.  The effect of violating
that constraint can be seen on any site that uses client-sessions
on the back-end, such as is common in J2SE.  Such sites are usually
several orders of magnitude less scalable than REST-based
applications, but some folks still prefer it for "personalization".
My experience has been that this is the number one cause of failed
website applications: reliance on server-side sessions.

BTW, "personalization" can be defined as deliberately trading off
scalability for customized content.  The advertising folks who took
over the Web design space in 1996 claimed that this was a necessity,
often making it a core component of third-party "evaluations" of
website usability, but if you actually go and talk to the customers
using those sites you will find that they hate it with a passion.
Amazon is the only site that did it well, and it continues to cost
them a fortune in back-end costs.

<pre>&gt; So if I PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, there now exists a resource with that name

What is a resource?  What makes you think it didn't exist before the 
PUT?

Yeah, I know that's an annoying answer, but it is quite pointless to be
discussing these things if we aren't even clear on what is a resource.

A resource is a source for *future* responses to future requests.  Thus,
the resource will already exist by virtue of you eventually doing the 
PUT,
and what you are doing with those requests is changing the responses
to future requests.  Whether or not those ancestral names, or any other
names that might have been created by the usual side-effects, are
accessible to future requests (and hence are resources) is defined by
the server and not by the protocol (or even the style).

The server might choose to reject the PUT request simply because it
wants access control to be specified first.  Interoperability is
obtained not by restricting the behavior of the server, but by
requiring that the server respond according to its desires and
enabling the client to understand that response.

One of the keys to understanding how REST works is to understand that
the implementations have no clue what the resource is or how it is
defined or what, in fact, makes it a resource.  That is just too hard
a concept for the implementations to handle.  Even the human beings
maintaining the site have a hard time figuring that one out, because
we just aren't very good at predicting the future.  In contrast,
it is relatively easy to talk about representations, storing them
and mapping them to names that are resources, since those are
operations that manipulate bits in the "now" and are easy for
server mechanisms to understand and implement.

Thus, it is not necessary to know what the fate of /foo/bar/ might
be after a

    PUT /foo/bar/thing

even though we do know what its fate will be after a

    DELETE /foo/

has successfully completed.  Note, however, that the success of the
first request does not imply that the server must allow the second
request.  It may choose to forbid it (for any reason).

Subject:Personalisation and REST (Gedankenexperiment)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The folks at pointlessvanity.com would like to construct a website which 
personalises each page delivered to the user by including their name in 
small letters at the bottom of each page. They would like to build a 
standards compliant REST system, so user authentication will be done 
with one of the schemes in RFC 2617.

In order to meet the REST visibility requirement, the URI structure will 
include the userid. Although in practice this could be done using CGI 
style parameters, the developers are lazy, so the userid will be 
represented as the top level path component.

Thus

/&lt;userid&gt;/home

is the home page, and

/&lt;userid&gt;/mirroronthewall

is the vanity mirror on the wall page.

This allows the developers to use relative links and thus static pages 
which do not need to contain the userid directly.

As a further access control requirement, users are only alloed to access 
their own pages; thus the &lt;userid&gt; in the URI must match the userid 
given in the HTTP Authorization: header.

So far so good, this seems to not break REST principles.

Pointlessvanity.com would like to publicly adverise some of the URI 
within the site (e.g. the vanity mirror), but they obviously cannot give 
a specific URI since this would only be valid for one user. So they 
would like an intelligent redirector, such that accesses to any page 
within their site with an empty &lt;userid&gt;, will redirect to the 
appropriate page based on the authorisation header.

So, if a client accesses

/mirroronthewall

with a userid of 'Richard' in the Authorization header, the redirector 
would redirect to

/Richard/mirroronthewall

The problem (to me) is this redirector seems to break REST principles, 
due to its use of the non-visible Authorization header to determine 
where to redirect to. Is this the case, or am I misunderstnding REST?

Right.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always assumed that this
additional constraint is a constraint on application semantics.  That
is, that a RESTful application semantic may not punt application
state.  So "LOGIN" wouldn't be a permitted semantic, because even though
a LOGIN message may be semantically self-contained (and uniform even),
it defers the maintenance of some application state (whether you're
authorized or not) to the server.

Is that right?  Does this additional constraint impact anything else?

&gt; The purpose of statelessness is to prevent partial failures and

Very good point.

But there's also a problem if the cookie is defined such that the
referenced state varies with time, which I would expect is much more
common than varying by gateway.  A message that references some other
state may be processed at a time when that state is different than it
was when the message was constructed.

I understand that this isn't as relevant to the simple browser/server
interactions of today, but architecturally speaking it seems quite
important, especially as we move towards disconnected and queued
interactions.

<pre>&gt; &gt; That concept tends to be a little confusing, partly because HTTP,
&gt; &gt; like many network protocols, has a notion of stateless interactions
&gt; &gt; that only refers to having all of the information needed to
&gt; &gt; understand each request inside the request or defined by universal
&gt; &gt; standard.  REST goes further and constrains application state
&gt; &gt; (not resource state) to be held on the client.
&gt; 
&gt; Right.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always assumed that this
&gt; additional constraint is a constraint on application semantics.  That
&gt; is, that a RESTful application semantic may not punt application
&gt; state.  So "LOGIN" wouldn't be a permitted semantic, because even though
&gt; a LOGIN message may be semantically self-contained (and uniform even),
&gt; it defers the maintenance of some application state (whether you're
&gt; authorized or not) to the server.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that right?  Does this additional constraint impact anything else?


After reading carefully, I'm not sure I can discern any additional
constraint in the above.  I'm starting with the assumption that without
"application state" there is no application.  Moving from there, if
each request is self-contained in that the server can interpret it
adding only universal standards, then by process of elimination there
must be some conversational state maintained by the client, because
there's not other place it can be.  And if the client doesn't maintain
that state, then there is no application, just an isolated iteraction.

What am I missing?

Consider that a single LOGIN message may be stateless (semantically
self-contained), yet have consequences for the interpretation of the
semantics of subsequent messages.  So while it's true that those
subsequent messages wouldn't be stateless in that case, the interaction
that made that the case, by handing off (right term?) application state,
was stateless.

Subtle, for sure.  But I don't even know that I'm right about how this
additional constraint reveals itself, so there could be more to it than
that.

Well, keep in mind that the actions of PUT and POST also defer the
maintenance of state to the server.  Since we could construct a login
semantic via the PUT of a user-specific resource, with logout being
signified by a DELETE, it would be odd for REST to disallow LOGIN
just on the basis of it being a stateful semantic.  I think it is more
accurate to say that, because user identification must be supplied
with each request subject to authentication, that an action like LOGIN
would only add overhead.

&gt; But there's also a problem if the cookie is defined such that the
&gt; referenced state varies with time, which I would expect is much more
&gt; common than varying by gateway.  A message that references some other
&gt; state may be processed at a time when that state is different than it
&gt; was when the message was constructed.
&gt;
&gt; I understand that this isn't as relevant to the simple browser/server
&gt; interactions of today, but architecturally speaking it seems quite
&gt; important, especially as we move towards disconnected and queued
&gt; interactions.

That same problem applies to resources.  We could attempt to model REST
as a shared-memory-by-message-passing system, but don't because that
model tries to maintain distributed consistency.  REST just says that
there is no consistency -- only representations that indicate state
at some point in the past and an implicit grant of use for some time
into the future.

<pre>Here is an email newsletter that I get.

The section "The Future of Web Services: On Track or Hijacked?" on
Web services, is mostly thinly veiled promotion, but had a few
interesting points.

Apparently, they want Web services standards to be more powerful
*and* less complex *and* easier to understand *and* more
interoperable.

I'd say that if that is where you want to get to, then Web services
is not the road you want to start down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Future of Web Services: On Track or Hijacked?

At SD West 2003, a panel of industry experts called 
for more powerful standards, business-strength solutions and 
interoperability to help Web services grow beyond the "very 
small tip of a very big iceberg."

Classes and panels at Software Development 2003, held last
month in Santa Clara, Calif., provided me with some useful 
insights into the current state of Web services deployment. 
Future newsletters will explore some of the ideas suggested by 
SD instructors, but this month I focus on "The Future of Web 
Services," a panel moderated by Jeff Moad, an editor at eWeek.

Participants included one CEO and three evangelists from vendors
marketing Web services solutions. Joining them was Jeff Barr, 
Web services evangelist from online bookseller Amazon.com. 

Moad kicked off the discussion by asking the panelists to
identify the gaps that remain unfilled in this interim period
before Web services becomes a new way of computing. Simon Phipps,
chief software evangelist from Sun Microsystems, noted that 
it's easy to get the impression that all the technical problems
have been solved, but that, in fact, many remain. The current
technology, as specified by the W3C and other standards 
organizations, is fine for small projects, he went on, but
business-strength solutions are lacking, creating a need for
proprietary products.

David Orchard, BEA's technical director, said that Web services 
lack tested interoperability, and that standards committees need 
to do much more to get important interoperability capabilities,
such as security and transactionality, working satisfactorily.

Barr sees a glass that is half full, and noted that the vendor
representatives' focus on a complete, industrial-strength 
solution--while ultimately necessary and well-intentioned--doesn't
negate the ability to build many solutions today, with existing 
technologies.

Developers have their hands full learning those current techno-
logies, Barr explained. Simply because a new standard is released
doesn't necessarily mean that developers feel a need to adopt it
immediately. He's also concerned that the industry could be 
"over-complicating" Web services with far too many complex and
interrelated specifications.

Mansour Safai, CEO of M7, commented that Web services doesn't 
make old, tough problems disappear. All of the existing challenges,
such as application integration and workflow, remain, regardless
of the technology used to implement a solution. Safai noted that,
at the end of the day, Web services are simply an API with 
different underpinnings than other distributed computing solutions.

==================================================================
**************************************************************

Focusing on the standards effort, IBM's Mark Colan, lead eBusiness
technical evangelist, asserted that a good Web services road map
is in place. All  that is needed now, he said, is to standardize
the pieces of the map.

Sun's Phipps commented that he felt that developers would respond
best to powerful and simple standards, though he acknowledged the
risk of large companies hijacking the standards process.

Safai emphasized that because enterprises have systems from different
vendors, interoperability is a key requirement. He cautioned that
simply because a standard describes a way for applications to talk
to each other, interoperability does not necessarily result.

Moad then directed the panelists to consider Phipp's contention
that Web services open standards are in danger of being hijacked
by proprietary solutions. BEA's Orchard suggested that, by their
nature, XML, SOAP and WSDL are extensible, and that keeping out
proprietary extensions will prove to be difficult. Phipps added
that there's nothing wrong with companies adding value through
proprietary extensions, as long as the companies clearly label 
them as such.

Turning to language implementations, Moad asked if Web services
will remain language-independent. Sun's Phipps said that everyone
except Microsoft is committed to Java. Although Sun, IBM and BEA
all use Java at the "end-points" of the Web services pipe, and
although there is twice as much Java code as there is XML code,
there is no required connection between the two.

Addressing the $64,000 question, Moad asked the panelists if they
considered Web services a success. Barr said that Amazon is currently
processing millions of calls per day using Web services, and that a
significant amount of business is transacted through the returned 
data. He feels that what Amazon, and others, have accomplished to date
is "just the very small tip of a very big iceberg."

That said, Barr continued, the industry needs to spend more time 
building applications using standards that have had a year or so to
mature and migrate to various toolkits. Working in this "comfort 
zone" produces the most successful application implementations.

Clearly--for Amazon, at least--Web services constitute an important
element of their distributed computing strategy, and in a future
newsletter, we'll revisit what Amazon and others are doing in the 
real world.

Oh, I see what you mean.  If you look back in my dissertation,

net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_4_3
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/

you will notice that there is only one constraint: communication must
be stateless in nature.  The remainder of the description is simply
explaining the properties induced by that constraint and the effect it
has on architectures based on that style.

In other words, they are just two sides of the same coin.

What do you think of the attempts of Paul Prescod and others to cast 
state-transition models into RESTful hyperlinked resources?

For example,
http://www.prescod.net/rest/state_transition.html 

For another example, many if not most business dealings require 
explioit agreements between trading partners, which is a form of 
consistency.  

A common business protocol for contracts (of which orders are a 
subtype) is Offer-Acceptance, which we have tried to RESTify several 
times on this list.

One way to do it, I think following Paul's proposals, would be to 
create separate hyperlinked resources for Offer, Response (Acceptance 
or Rejection) and Order.

If the Offer resource exists, and is not already hyperlinked to a 
Response, then the counter-party can post an Acceptance to the Offer 
resource.

If an Acceptance is posted, then an Order resource will be created, 
hyperlinked to the Offer and Acceptance.

Does this kind of interaction seem acceptably RESTful to you?  The 
interpretation of a message is dependent on the state of the resource 
to which it is posted, and to which it refers, in addition to the 
contents of the message itself.  (But nothing else.)

Thanks,
Bob Haugen

<pre>Interesting question.
I'm not clear on the use of redirection from a generic URI to a specific
URI... sounds good &amp; I'll use it when I can, but I don't know how to
describe that URI as a resource.

You may want to look into the Vary response header - this may give the
ability to use the same URI for different representations (e.g. the username
somewhere on the page) and indicate by what request header the
representation varies by.

&gt; due to its use of the non-visible Authorization header to determine
I'm not sure what you mean by 'non-visible'. Visibility means to me the
ability for software to consistently find and use the information, not about
human user visibility... perhaps I misunderstood your statement.

There's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, of course, if that's what
you mean; you don't have the Authorization header until after a 401
response has been sent.  But how you outlined that app is exactly how
I'd do it, and I believe it's quite RESTful.

I'd solve the chicken/egg prob by writing up a little app (rather than
using the Web server's auth/redirection capabilities) that returns 401
when accessed without an Authorization header and 302 to /$userid/ when
accessed with one, and then bind that to whatever URI you want to use to
identify the indirect reference (e.g. /mypage).

Yes, Waterken Inc. is.

The web-calculus that we discussed a while back isn't just about
providing a security model. The web-calculus is a model for
building a REST interface to an application. I've built a number
of mappings of the web-calculus to local application models. The
one I'm pushing the most at this time is the Waterken RDB Webizer.
See:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/

There's a high level overview and a full developer tutorial linked
to from that page.

I am a little late getting to this thread because I was away at
the DOCsec 2003 conference when the thread started. At the
conference, I presented the web-calculus and the Waterken RDB
Webizer. The response was very enthusiastic. A number of people
found the union of REST and capability-based security to be a very
compelling model. This is especially interesting since DOCsec is
an OMG sponsored conference. Most of the attendees are still
committed to CORBA technology and find REST a foreign concept.

The DOCsec 2003 conference home page is:

http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/docsec2003/index.htm

My presentation slides are at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/DOCsec2003/

Building a REST programming environment for relational databases
is a very interesting first case. Since SQL doesn't come with any
procedural programming baggage, it's possible to build a
programming environment in which the entire application is built
in the REST mindset. You can build the entire application by just
defining the resource web, never being forced to switch gears and
write procedural code.

If anyone on the list would like to use the Waterken RDB Webizer
on a current project, I would be willing to provide a free license
in exchange for a product testimonial.

Hmm... this would imply to me that any application can be done RESTfully if
refactored enough.  First, is this true?  Second, is this always ideal?

Sure, but that's not REST-specific.

Of course not.

IMO, REST is the best available description of a "good Web app".  My
response above was just saying that if you're building a Web app, and it
isn't RESTful, that REST tells you what problems to expect (e.g.
cookies = less visibility and application state issues (i.e. back
button problems)).  That's not making a value judgement on whether or
not your app should or shouldn't be RESTful, it's just saying that if it
isn't, there's a downside.  There may very well be an upside to not
being RESTful for some Web apps.

Yes, Waterken Inc. is.

The web-calculus that we discussed a while back isn't just about
providing a security model. The web-calculus is a model for
building a REST interface to an application. I've built a number
of mappings of the web-calculus to local application models. The
one I'm pushing the most at this time is the Waterken RDB Webizer.
See:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/

There's a high level overview and a full developer tutorial linked
to from that page.

I am a little late getting to this thread because I was away at
the DOCsec 2003 conference when the thread started. At the
conference, I presented the web-calculus and the Waterken RDB
Webizer. The response was very enthusiastic. A number of people
found the union of REST and capability-based security to be a very
compelling model. This is especially interesting since DOCsec is
an OMG sponsored conference. Most of the attendees are still
committed to CORBA technology and find REST a foreign concept.

The DOCsec 2003 conference home page is:

http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/docsec2003/index.htm

My presentation slides are at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/DOCsec2003/

Building a REST programming environment for relational databases
is a very interesting first case. Since SQL doesn't come with any
procedural programming baggage, it's possible to build a
programming environment in which the entire application is built
in the REST mindset. You can build the entire application by just
defining the resource web, never being forced to switch gears and
write procedural code.

If anyone on the list would like to use the Waterken RDB Webizer
on a current project, I would be willing to provide a free license
in exchange for a product testimonial.

If we're talking about using no non-REST ideas then no. Session based
webapps can't be done with REST because it's a requirement that there
be no session.

I don't think thats quite right; REST does not prohibit sessions, the

Having said this sessions are often a lazy way of web app programming 
where information is stuffed into an (invisible) session instead of 
carried around in the URI - visibility again.

Aha, very interesting. From RFC 2616 it seems that I can use the

I agree that REST is the best way of building webapps. But session
based webapps are sometimes necessary because of user requirements
and REST does not strictly handle those.

However, cookies can be put in on top of a REST architecture without
complicating it too much. Roy is right that they're evil but user now
sometimes expect them unfortunately.

I've just finished building an app for a user that had one of these
odd requirements. It's a legal information app, users buy access and
get an account. The accounts aren't necessarily unique to a user (an
organisation might buy the right to login 10 times). My client has a
very confused idea of what authentication is, but they have legacy
business reasons for it, so I can't change it.

The requirement that really breaks REST is that the user's can store
altered forms of the documents in the system but those documents are
only visible to them. These documents are in XML on a SQL database so
we have a session based user document table. In effect the session
lasts a long time, but it's still a session.

Without embedding the user id in a url (strictly, against REST as
well) I can't see how I would have done this without cookies.


Having said that, the rest (scuse the pun) of the app is REST based
and works pretty well. At the end of the day the cookie stuff is
really only an interaction between the client and the stored procs in
the database.


I think you can state categorically that REST cannot handle
personalization because user id urls are frowned on and cookies are
disliked. How else to maintain the personalization state?

Roy says that personalization applications aren't worth
much and I broadly agree, but some are and we can't always convince
our clients that they don't need personalization.

Specific to the screenshot, I thought the application is sending a 
query/update from browser without "https" over an open channel. My 
point was, one purpose of UI is to hide complexity (think database), 
but another purpose is to maintain security, right?

If that is allowed, then there are a lot of queries one can write 
using this interface to unlock the underlying database. Added to 
that, the traffic on the website can be tapped to take a look at the 
queries.

I agree we have to have some access to database. Opening database to

cards. Hackers could break through security loopholes where there 
were deemed none, and opening up the database, I thought, just opens 
up the heart of the kill for the attackers.

&gt; This security model is based on "http" and doesn't require "https"?

Ah. The screenshot you point out should indeed be using an https
connection. I'll replace the screenshot. When a capability is
passed between computers, an encrypted and server authenticated
channel MUST be used.

The preceding Tour page shows a correct capability URL. See:

Subject:Python support for Amazon Web services<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
I've developed a small amount of Python support for the
XML-over-HTTP mode of Amazon Web services.  Amazon describes this
as their REST mode.

The support I've developed consists mostly consists of Python code
that helps to parse and process the Amazon WS XML documents.

Also, to produce this support I used generateDS.py (see:
http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/#generateDS). Therefore, I needed
XML Schema documents.  So, being a Calvinist [1], I decided
implement generateXsd.py, which extracts an XML Schema from an XML
instance document.  It's included in the distribution.

There is a document describing this support at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/amazon_ws_support.html

And the distribution file is at:

    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/amazon_ws_support-1.0.tar.gz

The Amazon WS developer's kit is available at:

Ok, good, that answers one important question.  Here are some others, 
don't know yet if they are important or not - just trying to get my 
mind around capabilities + REST.

* How do capabilities and hyperlinks go together?  Does a tension 
arise between them?  E.g. wouldn't a capability container resource 
necessarily give you capabilities for all of the contained resources? 
What about navigating networks (graphs) of hyperlinks?

* Do capabilities and digital signatures (e.g. for non-repudiation) 
go together?  I don't see why not.  If I understand correctly, access 
is not dependent on your identity (only that you possess the 
capability URI).  But your identity is still significant in other 
ways.

* Has anybody used capabilities and access control lists based on 
identity together?  Do you think that is a bad idea, or useful in 
some situations?  Which situations?

* Open-ended, sorry:  what are the disadvantages of capability URIs?

Subject:Hybrid interface - Advantage of REST?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Hi. I've been following this REST vs. "document style" SOAP
debate (I assume RPC style is dead on both sides), and I'm
starting to think one of the advantages of REST is that you
can actually create a hybrid web service that both human and
machine can handle.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is difficult with
SOAP (even with document-style one) unless it gets fully
RESTified and utilizes URI to locate every resource/service.

For example, while I was attending Amazon BOF held at O'Reilly
ETech conf, I was playing with the idea of browser extension
that keep track of books I have shown interest (i.e. clicked or
browsed). Okay, I'm not sure how useful is that, but the point is
that embedded, machine-processible REST interface (probably
using XHTML+XML?) can be used not only for browsing, but to
seamlessly enhance my ability to explore information. This is
difficult if "for-human" WS and "for-machine" WS are separate
things.

Can anyone here verify me, or am I missing something?

I am happy to help.

&gt; * How do capabilities and hyperlinks go together?  Does a tension
&gt; arise between them?

Capabilities and hyperlinks go together like peas in a pod. The
action of clicking a hyperlink on a previously received page, to
get another page, is exactly the style of interaction that use of
capabilities is modelled on.

As a simple example of this, consider the Accountant resource at:

https://www.waterken.com/coffeebreak/6gjz7l6fnoxlbikw7akqgxhrsy.html

(Note: www.waterken.com is using a self-signed certificate with
SHA1 fingerprint:
28:B5:86:C5:76:AE:9F:9D:DA:1D:8F:32:3B:1A:E5:FF:B2:AF:1B:F3)

&gt; E.g. wouldn't a capability container resource
&gt; necessarily give you capabilities for all of the contained resources?

Yes, as is demonstrated in the example above. Typically, I don't
think of this in terms of containers, but in terms of what
resources are reachable from a given resource.

&gt; What about navigating networks (graphs) of hyperlinks?

The graph of hyperlinks is how your define your application's
security policy. At runtime, users traverse the graph, or
resource web, that is your application. In this way, the graph
simultaneously defines and enforces your access policy.

&gt; * Do capabilities and digital signatures (e.g. for non-repudiation)
&gt; go together?  I don't see why not.  If I understand correctly,
&gt; access is not dependent on your identity (only that you possess
&gt; the capability URI).

Capabilities and digital signatures do not typically go together.
You nailed it with your first guess: capabilities are not identity
based, whereas digital signatures are.  Use of a digital signature
implicitly means that your security model is identity-based, ie:
the signature is done by some principal.

There are simple capability graph patterns that can be used to
solve most problems that people use digital signatures for.
Non-repudiation is not one of these. The crux of non-repudiation
based on a digital signature is that the client possesses a
private key that no one else does. Capabilities themselves do not
provide a similar cryptographic primitive.

That said, I doubt the value of digital signature based
non-repudiation. I very much doubt it is something you could take
to court, and if you can't, what's the point. Unless you are also
going to deploy a new legal court system, digital signatures don't
make much sense.

&gt; But your identity is still significant in other ways.

Actually, when you get right down to specific scenarios, identity
is more of a problem than a requirement. Using an identity-based
security model opens you up to the Confused Deputy attack. See:

http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/ConfusedDeputy.html

&gt; * Has anybody used capabilities and access control lists based on
&gt; identity together?

I think Agorics Inc. implemented an MLS system on top of KeyKOS, a
capability-based operating system. They did this solely to satisfy
the demands of a government contract.

&gt; Do you think that is a bad idea, or useful in
&gt; some situations?  Which situations?

People always seem to want to pile security devices on top of each
other, but in this case, it doesn't make much sense.

&gt; * Open-ended, sorry:  what are the disadvantages of capability URIs?

The main problem with capabilities is one of perception rather
than fact. In the capability model, it is only possible to express
security policies that are actually enforceable. In contrast, the
ACL security model allows, even encourages, expression of security
policies that are not actually enforceable. As a result, people
often happily accept the false promises of an ACL and are annoyed
that the capability model won't tell them similarly comforting
lies.

We went through an example of this during the last discussion of
capabilities on this list. See the thread root at:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3456

&gt; Thanks, interesting stuff,

Thanks. I look forward to continuing this discussion.

&lt;MKA&gt;

Here's a partial answer of the partial question I understood. Tell me if that's not the question.

"for person" WS is similar to B2C (business to consumer). The promise of WS to B2C may come much more in future, because of (1) smaller market segmet, (2) lower utility, and (3) lack of clarity in what it could solve in reality (remember, WS is not fully evolved).

"for machine" WS is similar to EDI, EAI or B2B (automated or semi-automated to a large extent). The current era we are living in WS (REST vs SOAP), I think, is about this mechanization of internet (aka, Internet ver 2.0).

So, yes, B2C and B2B are two different needs with two different set of requirements, objectives, concentrations and technological infrastructure. Having saturated B2B solutions in the 3 phases (viz, ROI, Strategy &amp; Expansion phases of WS implementations); may be someday we will step in B2C WS (where your refrigerator orders milk automatically, when it is low on supply?).

I'd like to hear other thoughts/comments/disagreements.

&lt;/MKA&gt;


Can anyone here verify me, or am I missing something?

&gt; 1. RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.

He said "document style" SOAP, which is a reference to the interaction
style described in the SOAP 1.2 specs.  SOAP 1.1 is RPC.  SOAP 1.2 is
a bunch of things.  REST is not a form of RPC.

&gt; 2. REST is about server holds state is stateless, with SOAP you can do
&gt;    that, but its not a dogma.

REST is an architectural style that is only present when all of its
constraints are met.  SOAP is a protocol.

&gt; 3. So REST versus SOAP is a meaningless distinction.

Yes, but he wasn't talking about SOAP.  He was talking about one of
the interaction styles described by the SOAP specifications.

&gt; 4. REST is about resources that you can access by an URI. No
&gt;    implication that it is better or easier human or machine readable.

Having the URI makes it possible for both human and machine-driven
interaction.  He is right -- that is one of the advantages of REST-style
applications, and it is used every day in the form of bookmarks.
However, the document-style interactions in SOAP 1.2 do allow for
the server to provide a URI, so the advantage only exists over those
SOAP 1.2 resources that are poorly implemented (i.e., all of them).

Subject:Talking about REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have just given a talk about REST to the other techies at my
current client (including the man in charge of development). The
audience was of mixed ability, from old time hackers to complete
newbies in web development.

Here is a very short summary of audience reaction and my thoughts
about it. I hope it's useful.


The reaction of most was to question whether I was talking about
anything clever, to question the validity of REST because of it's
simplicity. The more experience programmers (who have topyed with
SOAP and XMLRPC) were more enthusisatic.


It's clear that many people don't really understand HTTP. REST
evangelists need to do more to explain HTTP to people.


I expected some confusion and incredulity about the stuff about
sessions and I got some. Again, the more experienced were more
inclined to listen to the REST p-o-v. But the prevaliing view about
sessions was "go tell the marketing dept" because this company does
quite a lot of personalization based on cookies.


So, in summary, the talk was pretty succesful. My only doubt is how
much I should push the sessions issue. I'm still not clear myself
about that.

I really didn't understand it then. If I read "interaction style", I
suppose you refer to Request-Response, Solicit-Response stuff?? Was
already present in SOAP 1.1.

Throwing document in the mix, I understood this as the RPC versus
Document style of message exchange, the particular format of the body
of a SOAP message. I.e. the style attribute in an WSDL &lt;soap:binding&gt;
with values "rpc" or "document".

&gt;
&gt; 1. RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.
Although a system based on REST may use RPC to accomplish the job, REST is
different from RPC in that it is not an 'extensible procedures' type of
approach. In fact, it is the opposite - 'limited set of procedures' is the
goal.

&gt;
&gt; 2. REST is about server holds state is stateless, with SOAP you can do
&gt;    that, but its not a dogma.
I'm not sure I understand the grammar of the sentence, but REST isn't about
one side or the other 'holding' state - its about the transfer of whatever
state you do have between the components.

&gt;
&gt; 3. So REST versus SOAP is a meaningless distinction.
REST is architecture, SOAP is technology. You can build REST based systems
with SOAP. But if everybody builds their own unique (non-interoperable) REST
based system, then that aggregate larger system becomes unRESTful.

&gt;
&gt; 4. REST is about resources that you can access by an URI. No
&gt;    implication that it is better or easier human or machine readable.
REST is about resources you can identify. Using a URI is the Web way of
doing things. An RDBMS has another way of identifying resources that does
not use URI (to the extent that an RDBMS has aspects of REST). A particular
implementation system would use a protocol to actually access the resource.
For example, HTTP as a protocol can be used to access resources that are not
identified via the 'http' URI scheme.

----example request----
GET mailto:mdierken@... HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: ThoughtExperiment1.0
Accept: text/xml
Authorization: BASIC Y7HUH876=


----example response----

&gt; It's clear that many people don't really understand HTTP.
This is truly an understatement. Even when explained, it takes some
implementation practice for people to really trust that it really is that
easy &amp; that it really can do a lot.

Here are some books to look at:

HTTP: The Definitive Guide (Price:   $31.47US)
by David Gourley, Brian Totty
Behind every web transaction lies the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-the
language of web browsers and servers, of portals and search engines, of
e-commerce and web services. Understanding HTTP is essential for practically
all web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.

&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565928628/topiczero-20&gt;
HTTP Pocket Reference (Price:  $9.95US)
by Clinton Wong
All web programmers, administrators, and application developers need to be
familiar with HTTP in order to work effectively. The HTTP Pocket Reference
provides a solid conceptual foundation of HTTP, and also serves as a quick
reference to each of the headers and status codes that compose an HTTP
transaction. For those who need to get "beyond the browser," this book is
the place to start.

&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471398233/topiczero-20/&gt;
HTTP Essentials (Price:   $24.49US)
by Stephen A. Thomas
This guide explains the protocol that defines how Web browsers communicate
with Web servers, the mechanisms that keep that communication secure, and
techniques for accelerating HTTP. Topics include the structure and format of
HTTP messages; security technologies such as SSL, TLS, and SHTTP; and how to
handle compatibility between HTTP versions. Coverage extends to related
technologies such as Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC), Web Proxy Auto
Discovery (WPAD), Web Cache Coordination Protocol (WCCP), Internet Cache
Protocol (ICP) and Hypertext Caching Protocol (HTCP).

&gt;&gt; [snip]
&gt;
&gt; Here's a partial answer of the partial question I understood. Tell
&gt; me if that's not the question.

Well, it was more of an thought experiment on how to support
user's information activity by utilizing "for machine" WS, so
I did not have specific model like B2C or B2B in my mind.

I'm using the word "for-human WS" as the current Web as it is
today, and "for-machine WS" as an upcoming part of the Web
where machines can do information processing. And I came to
think that hybrid, complementary use of these two will result

&gt;&gt; 1. RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.
&gt;
&gt; Although a system based on REST may use RPC to accomplish the job, REST is
&gt; different from RPC in that it is not an 'extensible procedures' type of
&gt; approach. In fact, it is the opposite - 'limited set of procedures' is the
&gt; goal.

I guess you could also say that REST's "uniform interface" is a
variation of RPC that it has lost "all hairs" because every REST
object is the same thing from RPC point of view. Is is still RPC
even if you have lost traditional RPC way of "differentiating" one
service from another?

&gt;&gt; [snip]
&gt;
&gt; Here's a partial answer of the partial question I understood. Tell
&gt; me if that's not the question.

Well, it was more of an thought experiment on how to support
user's information activity by utilizing "for machine" WS, so
I did not have specific model like B2C or B2B in my mind.

I'm using the word "for-human WS" as the current Web as it is
today, and "for-machine WS" as an upcoming part of the Web
where machines can do information processing. And I came to
think that hybrid, complementary use of these two will result
in a synergy that brings better web experience. And from this
point of view, RESTfullness of a service does seems to matter,
because in this case, "for machine" WS is actually part of
existing "for human" WS infrastructure (which is, RESTful).


&lt;MKA&gt;

UI vs Server Side distinction is probably what you are refering to? To that I think everything should be attempted to be automated to the extent that you need a user decision or input. User, IMHO, slows the computers down more than any other thing ... but on the flip side, computers of today cannot decide in adhoc ways like we do (no matter how hybrid). So, computers slow down humans too in that way?! :)

&lt;/MKA&gt;

&lt;MKA&gt;

Lower utility or not is economics of it (hardwork that can be traded). I think you are considering market capital and human utility as two different things; but I think they are not. They are related too closely.

Businesses exist for human need, but the distinction between prioritizing B2C vs B2B is that more impact can be made for the same human society at this time by B2B rather than B2C. 

(If not for economics based priorities, I think, people would breaking rocks in search of milk, and justifying their hardwork as very useful. Where we should put our efforts first and when is beyond technology alone to decide -- unless technology is for art and not for practical solutions.)

Subject:Handling big resources<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

I've a REST interface for relational databases. A GET message to (table)
resource produces the following list:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;resources xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
    &lt;resource
xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/sqlrest/CUSTOMER/0/"&gt;0&lt;/resource&gt;
    &lt;resource
xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/sqlrest/CUSTOMER/1/"&gt;1&lt;/resource&gt;
    &lt;resource
xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/sqlrest/CUSTOMER/2/"&gt;2&lt;/resource&gt;
    &lt;resource
xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/sqlrest/CUSTOMER/3/"&gt;3&lt;/resource&gt;
    ...
    &lt;resource
xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/sqlrest/CUSTOMER/600000/"&gt;600000&lt;/resource
&gt;
&lt;/resource&gt;

The list is to big to send it in one chunk. It would be better to breakt it
in smaller pieces.


Questions:

1.) Can the server send the response with a 206 Partial Content SC, even the
client hasn't requested a range?

2.) That is the RESTian way for the server, to give the client a hint where
or how he can request the next chunk?
    a.) A reference in the XML Content like &lt;resources
xlink:href="http://...
    b.) A Location Header field with the URL of the next Chunk
    c.) A Content-Range header field in the form:

        Content-Range: resources start-end / total

    d.) Both? A link in the XML Content and information in the header?

3.) Only the type "bytes" are mentioned in the HTTP specification. Can I use
a own type like resources or are there any proposals for REST?

4.) Are there a more REST like approach?

Thanx,
Thomas

To clarify, what most Web services folks mean by "RPC" is fine grained
invocations, like getStockQuote() returning "14.25".

What I mean by "RPC" (and I think many on rest-discuss do too) is where
developers get to define the remote "API", rather than having it
provided for them by the application protocol.

&gt; People then argue that SOAP is good
&gt; because it serves as an envelope and the processing patterns

Actually, no, they can't, at least without jumping through hoops.  SOAP
has mandatory and scoped extensions, which HTTP can't do very easily.
Just check out PEP and RFC 2774 to see an example of that.  Both those
forms of extension are not backwards-compatible, so deployment issues
abound too.

On the other hand, Waka's going to have both of those in there natively.

I mentioned that SOAP is well suited if you want to to asynchrononous
calls. You mentioned SMTP as a possible transport (else I couldn't
really make sense of the comment). But usually asynchronous
communcation is done with message queueing.

&gt; I have just given a talk about REST to the other techies at my

&gt;
&gt; Here is a very short summary of audience reaction and my thoughts

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The reaction of most was to question whether I was talking about
&gt; anything clever, to question the validity of REST because of it's
&gt; simplicity. The more experience programmers (who have topyed with
&gt; SOAP and XMLRPC) were more enthusisatic.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's clear that many people don't really understand HTTP. REST
&gt; evangelists need to do more to explain HTTP to people.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I expected some confusion and incredulity about the stuff about
&gt; sessions and I got some. Again, the more experienced were more
&gt; inclined to listen to the REST p-o-v. But the prevaliing view about
&gt; sessions was "go tell the marketing dept" because this company does
&gt; quite a lot of personalization based on cookies.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So, in summary, the talk was pretty succesful. My only doubt is how
&gt; much I should push the sessions issue. I'm still not clear myself
&gt; about that.

Everyone is taking the document centric approach, even for the SOAP

I think of it as an 'automation' interface parallel with the 'visual'

capabilities.

&gt;
&gt; Notably, Amazon and Google expose web services distinct from their user

Distinct &amp; much simpler to program with (at least the REST oriented Amazon

Hmm. Good question. For me, visibility also implies standardization, which
lets me program a server regardless of client - everybody uses the same auth
header &amp; syntax &amp; meaning. It's not just for intermediaries.
Visibility for me is also the standardization of key aspects &amp; generic
aspects of a message - resource identifier, method, authentication,
representation metadata (content-type...), etc. I'm not all that interested
in visibility for something like the phone number of someone purchasing a
book.

What it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;

"Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to monitor

I think that says it all.  Was there something in particular about that
definition that you had trouble with?

&gt;"Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to monitor

&gt;
&gt;I think that says it all.  Was there something in particular about that
&gt;definition that you had trouble with?
&gt;  
&gt;
Well, its one of those definitions where my reaction is "OK - now what 
does that mean."  I'm sure its an accurate and succinct definition, its 
just too terse for my small brain.  What are the pros and cons of 
having/not having visibility?  How do I determine what or how much an 
intermediary needs to see in order to have 'good' visibility?  When is 
something not visible?  What does it take to make something visible?

&gt;&gt;Can someone give me an example of why and how visibility is important 
&gt;&gt;(in REST).  I suspect that one of the examples will involve proxies, so 
&gt;&gt;if someone could give an additional example that'd be even better.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Given the definition, providing an example that doesn't use an
&gt;intermediary would be tough. 8-).
&gt;
OK.  I guess I was hoping someone had an example of an intermediary that 
wasn't a proxy or a gateway..

&gt; "Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to 
&gt; monitor
&gt; or mediate the interaction between two other components. "

Why it's important?  Hmm...

There are several places where it comes into play:

   o efficient intermediaries

     - security across trust boundaries

     Many networks don't trust each other, or at least don't trust what
     is on the other side of a firewall.  As a result, intermediaries are
     installed to filter traffic.  That is a hard problem for 
general-purpose
     application protocols, so we need to make it easier in order to make
     filtering more efficient and gain the trust of firewall admins.

     - extensibility

     Visibility calls for more explicit descriptions within messages, as
     opposed to relying on external IDLs or XDR-style typing by schema,
     which in turn makes it easier to extend the functionality later.

     - evolvability

     When intermediaries can understand a request, they can more easily
     perform or adjust it on behalf of the intended recipient, just as
     WebTV or cell phone networks can adjust for their clients.

     - performance

     Visibility is necessary for cacheability.

   o understandability

     It is simply easier to build complex systems if you can see and
     understand the individual interactions.

   o reusability

     People learn by emulation.  That is described somewhat in the 
section
     on Java versus Javascript.

There are probably others.

2. Guaranteed delivery (+ error handling in case of timeouts).

3. Notification of delivery.

4. Guaranteed order of delivery.

I am wondering how much thought you have put into application
security and how it fits in with REST. Do you have a model for how
application security should be done? Has there been an exploration
of how application security affects other REST guidelines? It
seems like supporting access control has ramifications for many
parts of REST, the most well-known effect being the interplay of
HTTP Auth and caching. It seems that if not done carefully,
access control could negate many of the benefits of REST. What are
your thoughts?

Thank you for sharing your expertise.

Subject:ACID REST-HTTP (was: What is good about SOAP?)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>[prior discussion about SOAP and message-queues
elided]

Its nice that they defined a protocol for these
things on top of SOAP, but is there any reason to
believe that if they had put this design effort
into doing it on top of HTTP/SMTP (and perhaps
RESTfully), we would not have these services
without the SOAP horror?

Strawman ACID REST-HTTP Protocol:
1. Define Client MIME header:
 transaction: yes

2. Define Server MIME header:
 transaction-location: http://controlURL

3. Client makes HTTP requests with transaction
header.  If the server can accomplish the request,
it responds with ACCEPTED and a
transaction-location header.

4. If client wants to rollback the transaction,
it posts ROLLBACK to all the
transaction-locations.  If the client wants to
commit the transaction, it posts PREPARE to all
the transaction-locations.  If any return
an error then it posts ROLLBACK to all of them
and the transaction fails.  If none return an
error, the client posts COMMIT to all the
transaction-locations and the transaction
succeeds.

RESTful and transactional without all of SOAP's
plumbing.

Strawman SMTP:

1. Send messages with a transaction header and a
message-id header. e.g.

 Transaction: yes
 Message-id: abc123@....1234
 From: dsn-recipient@...

 insert foo into bar

2. To commit send a multipart/digest with subject:
COMMIT and each part with a RFC2017 external-body
content type, e.g.:

 From: dsn-recipient@...
 Message-id: abc123@....1234
 Subject: COMMIT
 Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundar=abc

 --abc
 content-type: external-body; access-type=url;
   URL="mid:message-id_1"

 --abc
 content-type: external-body; access-type=url;
   URL="mid:message-id_2"

 --abc--

Message is processed (and in order) only if all
external-bodies are present.

Note: This protocol nests.  The commit message may
itself have a transaction: yes header in which
case it waits until someone commits the commmit.

&gt; 3. Notification of delivery.

See RFC1891: Delivery Service Notifications

&gt; 4. Guaranteed order of delivery.

See above.

&gt; 5. Priorization.

I am not sure what this means, but I suspect you
don't want it because it violates the End-To-End
principle.

This is so wrong, that I must assume you have not worked on enterprise

1. What if an entity I invoke, invokes other entities, and what if
   they have transactions of their own? Are they in the same
   transaction? A new transaction? Do they nest?

2. What if an entity I invoke also sends messages? Are they in the
   transaction as well? In what order?

3. If the client goes down, is the transaction committed? Rolled back?

4. Doing two or three phase commit at the client is really innovative

Maybe I sounded a bit harsh, not my intention really. If you have not
worked with transaction managers and the Corba/MTS (COM+) stuff, you
might not have a real idea what those can do for you and what problems
they try to solve.

My intention is not to defend what they are doing, or to deny there
might be better ways to solve it. But the issues they try to solve are
real, and they bring in a lot of value.

So is it fair to say that visibility is about a third party's ability to

party to figure out the intent/meaining of a message?

Also, does visibility imply the ability of any arbitrary third party to

particular third party to be able to understand the message.  In other 
words, is visibility, to a ceratin extent, application specific (and by

In either protocol, there is no commit until COMMIT.
If you are concerned about client reliability in then set up a durable 
server
to handle the commits.  In the HTTP context, you have a reliable HTTP 
server that posts PREPARE and perhaps COMMIT to a list of URLs supplied in 
a single HTTP request.  In the SMTP context, this is what SMTP servers 
already do for desktop mail clients.  The "unreliable" client sends 
messages to the server and the server is responsible for guaranteeing

I assume you are not familiar with the End-To-End (Dumb Network) principle.
Discussion on the internet is quite extensive.  I'd point you to a URL, but 
I'm offline now (try http://isen.com).  The short answer is that 
prioritization is an application layer issue and not a protocol issue.  The 
Internet and even IP-telephony have been quite successful without QoS IP 
routing (some IP packets are more important than others).  Southwest 
Airlines chooses not to prioritize and is doing better than most airlines 
that do (yield-management).

Why burden the programmer with this? How will you ever proof this
works? I rather have declarative transactional semantics. And
sometimes you want to have points in a transaction that are saved
regardless if an error occurs later on. Sometimes you want to start a
new transaction. And sometimes an administrator wants to have a
different policy (declarative).

All supported by current transaction processing software.

    Alex&gt; Presumably in the order of the entities that send them.  How

It does not. It's completely outside SOAP. SOAP 1.1 is only about the
wire format. I find SOAP 1.2 so unreadable, that I don't have any idea
what it is saying )-:

I just mentioned some things that message queuing software can
do. Those are really outside the SMTP protocol at the moment. Nothing
prevents them to be added. But if you are lookingn for a solution now,
SMTP does not play.


    &gt;&gt; 3. If the client goes down, is the transaction committed?

Replace your "durable server" by transaction processing manager and
your solution is exactly what I was talking about. Your "durable
server" is doing the work.

But again, the point is not if the HTTP server can do it, but that it
does not currently. And secondly, letting the client decide the
transaction boundaries, is not very wide on the internet: you don't
want someone on the internet to have the possibility to determine
duration of locks in your database.

Well, this is a business issue, isn't it? If a client asks you to
implement something, are you going to argue that maybe they should do
something different? You can argue, if you are at a certain level in
the discussion, but if you are just hired to install the plumbing,
you're not going to decide that a different building might have been
better.

Maybe I was not clear in my replies: on request, I just pointed out
what message queuing can do NOW for you. You started to give a
possible implementation in SMTP/HTTP, which I argued does not even
start to address the issues that transaction processing software has
solved for a great many years. We can argue that transaction
processing software is not needed, but that's a different discussion.

I think message queueing etc. is great stuff for building your
enterprise software. It's probably not that great to expose it to
clients you don't have control about. I expose an SMTP/HTTP interface
to the world, not COM objects, or an MQ Series queue. I think both
solutions have their proper place and proper ues.

Visibility is just the property, and an architectural style has a
certain amount of it.  I would say that any RESTful interaction has at
least some (large) amount of visibility.  "At least", because for any
given use of it in a "RESTful app", one can probably find additional
constraints (even unintended ones) that induce additional properties,
some of which may yield improved visibility.  For example, an HTML
knowledgeable HTTP intermediary has greater visibility into an
interaction between two components exchanging HTML with HTTP, than it
does with those same components exchanging SVG.

What's really going on here, IMO, is that the app I described can be
viewed as its own system, while remaining a subsystem of the Web.  So if
you created an architectural style which described this subsystem, you
would likely include all of REST's constraints, but have an additional
constraint called "Common data format and language", or some such.  This
constraint is what induces the additional visibility in this app beyond
what REST, by itself, provides.

But visibility isn't special, of course.  Any architectural property
works the same way.

having a proper escape string function in your library. It might not

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; I am wondering how much thought you have put into application
&gt; security and how it fits in with REST.

Bunches.

&gt; Do you have a model for how
&gt; application security should be done? Has there been an exploration
&gt; of how application security affects other REST guidelines? It
&gt; seems like supporting access control has ramifications for many
&gt; parts of REST, the most well-known effect being the interplay of
&gt; HTTP Auth and caching. It seems that if not done carefully,
&gt; access control could negate many of the benefits of REST. What are
&gt; your thoughts?

Even if it is done carefully, access control does negate some goals
of REST (shared caching in particular).  However, it doesn't negate
the benefits of the model: a given security model can be analyzed
to see how it affects applications that are attempting to communicate
using the REST model, and then improved based on those observations.
Likewise, security models can learn from the lessons of REST in order
to improve their efficiency.

I think it is very important to note that the REST model is not ideal
for all applications, and that various aspects of security (access
control, authentication, authorization, accounting, and privacy of
communication) will place requirements on the architecture that need
to be addressed in the interaction model.

Most sites address this issue by separating secure services from the
services that need higher scalability.  This is hampered somewhat by
the goofy way that WWW browsers warn about "secure" sites containing
"insecure" embedded content.  Likewise, just about every variation on
securing web sites is damaged in one way or another by browser
behavior, which is why sites currently use cookies as authenticators.

I should note that the big conflict between REST and security models
is the fact that REST does not allow for sessions.  What needs to be
understood is that sessions are bad for security models too -- they
cause most of the denial-of-service and man-in-the-middle attacks
to be possible.  What is needed is an efficient, session-free means
of authenticating that is more secure than username/password, which
is actually an easy problem to solve if you don't try to solve all
of the security problems at once.  What is blocking that is the need
to negotiate security mechanisms before engaging in secure
communication, which is currently done within a session.

I'll just add that one thing we want out of an architecture is the
ability to adapt to, or be adapted by, future changes in the evolving
way that the system is being used.  Life is change.

In general, it is far easier to adapt a system that is self-descriptive
(high visibility of syntactic and semantic meaning within the structure
of communication), both because the interactions are easier for third
parties to understand and because the communicating parties are less
likely to base their communication on shared out-of-band assumptions:
assumptions that may not be applicable in the future.  In other words,
the components of a successful computing systems are never just
communicating among themselves, because success will lead to change
and change will lead to new components.

Subject:Has trailing slash any significance?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello All,

If you start doing URL rewriting you can make URLs that cannot exist
in a file system. For example I can say that:

    /authors

returns a list of authors and

    /authors/peter

returns a single author.

But with URL rewriting it's just as easy to say that

  /authors/

returns the list of authors.


My point is that /authors cannot exist in a file system if it has a
subdirectory. You either must say /authors/ (and get some default
file) or peter should go into another directory like:

    /author-list
    /authors/peter

(I think webservers send a moved/redirect if you ask for /authors or
fetch the default page in that directory anyway??)


But my question: for cases like this is it better to append a trailing
slash if you want to get a list of things in a directory or does it
not matter at all? So is:

    /authors

or

    /authors/

preferred?

Any thoughts on this appreciated.

Yes it can. It's the subdirectory itself. What that means is open to
interpretation. On un*x systems a directory is a special file
containing a list of the files and directorys contained within the
directory.


&gt; (I think webservers send a moved/redirect if you ask for /authors or
&gt; fetch the default page in that directory anyway??)

A lot of webservers do behave like that. But that behaviour is not
intrinsic to the way the web works. A webserver after all meerly maps
an arbritary URI based namespace to some behaviour (in this case
returning an index.html page or some such).

Apache just returns an index in this situation, the index behaviour
is often the commonly understood index.html trick. But it needn't be.
 

&gt; But my question: for cases like this is it better to append a trailing

The trailing slash does have an effect on HTML form posts for browser
contexts. If you're resource is:

   /authors/

you can have a form POST or GET to "." and it will go to the current
page. Having:

  /authors

as the resource and doing a POST or GET to "." will send the request
to:

  /


So there is a difference as far as common browsers are concerned. I'm
not sure it's spec compliant behaviour though. Just common.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>The context of this discussion was whether SOAP is superior to REST-HTTP 
because it specifies ACID/MQ services.  My point is that if we put in a 
little work we can specify the same services on top of HTTP/SMTP and reuse 
more of our installed based of software while simultaneously avoiding the 
complexity of SOAP.

The implementation details of transaction managers/monitors, ease of 
development, long/dropped transactions, and prioritization are really 
implementation or application issues not protocol issues.  If someone has a 
reliable client, they don't need a separate HTTP transaction manager 
server.  Control of sub-transactions can be as easy as editing a list of 
current commits/rollbacks, but that is really an IDE question and not a 
protocol one.
There are millions of shopping carts abandoned everyday across the 
Internet.  How you handle this issue depends on your site. etc.

I am suggesting the HTTP/SMTP equivalent of ODBC.  That MS Access exposes 
ODBC but does not implement two-phase-commit may be a problem with MS 
Access, but it is not a problem with ODBC.  Similarly, that you may want a 
separate transaction manager for ACID-HTTP is not an objection to 
ACID-HTTP, it is just one of your particular implementation issues.

i think this is more generally about relative URIs, which are 
interpreted relative to a base URI (that of the request).  much like a 
relative and absolute path in a filesystem, but not exactly the same.

and yes, a trailing slash or lack thereof affects how dot (.) is 
interpreted in a user agent.  therefore it is important to be 
consistent or your HTML/client code will start breaking in subtle ways.

for the record, i stick with *always* using a trailing slash, and 
redirect requests that lack them to URIs that have them.  no index.html 
cruft whatsoever.  i don't know whether this is superior in any way to 
not having them though because i haven't tried this alternative.

If a resource is subject to access control, representations must
be transferred over an encrypted communications channel, such as
is provided by HTTPS. If HTTPS is used, there will be no shared
cache. In this case, the only relevant cache is the client's
personal cache. The client's personal cache can be keyed off the
client's personal URI. This makes option 2 the best choice, with
no need for setting a global "Content-Location" header.

Seairth, I'm a bit confused about your requirements. You say that they  
cannot share a common URI, but appear to list that as option #1. It's  
also unclear whether you just want user-agent caching or shared caching  
(e.g., in proxies); I'll assume the latter.

If that's the case, I'd recommend option #1 with
   Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate, max-age=0
This allows a cache to keep a copy of the representation, but forces it  
to validate each request on the origin server, thereby maintaining  
access control. (BTW, I would not recommend using no-cache, as some  
implementations may still incorrectly interpret this as having the  
semantics of no-store).

A few years back, I did a deployment of an authenticated document  
caching system for Merrill Lynch using this technique with both open  
source and commercial proxy caches, and it worked flawlessly.

A more efficient approach would be to cache the authentication state on  
intermediaries, rather than just the representations; this would allow  
them to avoid the round-trip back to the origin server every time. I  
wrote up an Internet-Draft [1] about this a while back, but the major  
drawback is that it won't work with Digest authentication. I don't know  
of any implementations.

Hope this helps,

If you send the resource representation in plaintext, you are
effectively delegating access to the resource to everyone else on
your network path. This violates the semantics of your access
control check.

In this case, using HTTP Auth without SSL doesn't provide any
actual security. I don't know how knowledgeable you are about

In this case, there is no sense in using digest authentication

I assume that you know that digest authentication only protects
the password, not the "privacy of the authenticator".

Perhaps rather than saying "access to the resource" it would be better to 
say "access to a representation of the resource".

For example, if the resource is a coffee machine and I POST something to
it that starts water boiling using digest authentication to prove that I
have authority to do so, that seems to be a valid use of authentication
over unencrypted HTTP.

In this case, access to a representation of the resource is
equivalent to access to the resource. We know this because Seairth
is specifically asking about a resource for which caching is
important. Given this information, your suggestion to use digest
authentication to "maintain the privacy of the authenticator"
doesn't make any sense.

Even if you wish to quibble over the above, it doesn't change the
fact that you've violated the semantics of the access control
check. The requestor intends to fetch a representation for
himself, not himself and everyone in the neighborhood.

Does it seem odd to anyone that I am needing to argue that it is
important to encrypt private data before transmitting it over a
public network?

&gt; &gt; In this case, using HTTP Auth without SSL doesn't provide any
&gt; &gt; actual security. I don't know how knowledgeable you are about
&gt;
&gt; "security" is such an imprecise term, isn't it?

Not in this context it isn't. Context is always important in
English.

<pre>Quoting Tyler Close &lt;tyler@...&gt;:

&gt; In this case, access to a representation of the resource is
&gt; equivalent to access to the resource. We know this because Seairth
&gt; is specifically asking about a resource for which caching is
&gt; important. Given this information, your suggestion to use digest
&gt; authentication to "maintain the privacy of the authenticator"
&gt; doesn't make any sense.

Yeeessss.... and I'm saying that a cached representation of a resource is
not equivalent to the range of representations that resource is capable of
emitting. There are scenarios where this is an important distinction.

&gt; Does it seem odd to anyone that I am needing to argue that it is
&gt; important to encrypt private data before transmitting it over a
&gt; public network?

Who said public network? Once again, there are scenarios where protecting
the authentication credentials is valuable, but the representations
themselves aren't as sensitive. I grant that there are likely many, many
more which do require encryption for appropriate security, but am
unwilling to say that all scenarios require it.

Since we seem to be starting to repeat ourselves, I suggest we move on.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Paul,

in http://mail.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/2002-February/007186.html
you write:

"I need a schema language that says what happens when you follow links,
 or apply HTTP methods to things that are referenced in links...I guess
 I'll have to do it myself some day."

Do you (or someone else) have any pointers to material related to this
issue?

Do you have any specific ideas how to formalize the way to 'say what happens'?
[a defined set of actions/modifications on representations perhaps?]

If there is any effort going on in that direction, I'd be happy to contribute.

Thanks in advance,


Jan

Subject:REST and RDBMS: mapping relational models to resource models<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
So we've done this one before, just wanted to check in to see if there 
was any new state-of-the-art thinking about this.

Assume:  I have an object model / relational database model (one, the 
other, and / or a mapping between them) that describes the domain 
objects of interest to me.  I would like to expose this in a naive 
fashion to via a RESTful interface;  i.e., assuming something like

GET /Entity --&gt; a representation of the extent (all instances of class 
/ rows in associated table)
GET /Entity?id=xxx --&gt; a represenation of the particular instance of 
Entity with id=xxx
POST /Entity &lt;-- some representation of an Entity --&gt; creates new 
/Table?id=yyy, redirects to it

It would be nice to have:

(1) a declarative way to describe the ER table.  There are many of 
these that generate DDL and object stubs or code
(2) a declarative way to map the ER model to a resource model / URI 
namespace
(3) a runtime framework which glues the two together
(4) preferably Python, but patterns / research in this area of any type 
is good
(5) abstraction of view / controller and app workflow to generate UI 
from declarative description a plus

Waterken looks interesting, but the capability stuff is 
overcomplicating unless it solves a specific problem you've got.

Kuhlman's FSM stuff is close, but no cookie:  modeling workflows, not 
an ER or object model.

Anyone one else?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jeff,

I think I get your drift.  Last year, when I did the REST-based
interface overhaul for my group's web service project, the spec I
wrote was partly about capturing the xml vocabulary of the
application, and partly about specifying the legal permutations
of resources and HTTP methods (and of course response codes).

The spec was somewhat formal (in the sense that it followed a
pretty strict pattern for conveying these data), but I could imagine
a strictly formal notation as well, not unlike WSDL.

I don't know WSDL very well, but I'll conjecture out loud that
there's nothing stopping you from using it to describe the
syntax and legal operation/resource space for an application that
is REST-based.

Does anyone know why that wouldn't work?  Is this not what you're
driving at?

Yeah, seems that would be kind of like trying to write object-oriented 
assembler.  Or something. ;-)  Possible, tedious, and of high cost for 
dubious benefit.  WSDL appears to me to be extreme overkill and 
low-level cognitive damage for something as simple as a REST-based 
application --- an overcooked layer cake with colorful acronym 
sprinkles.  Doubtless you need it (and the rest of the "stack") if 
you're doing RPCs, but if you're just exposing a resource model --- too 
much.  (Coordination is punted in either case.)

I think what I'm looking for is something like WSDL that lives at the 
resource / URIspace / HTTP level of abstraction.

The purpose of the Waterken web-calculus is to create a rigorous
model for building and describing a RESTful interface. The
web-calculus is a more constrained application of REST than HTTP
is, but I don't think this is at the cost of any functionality.

The web-calculus is at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/

A collection of machine generated schemas can be found at:

http://waterken.com/

A page showing how some of these descriptions were generated is at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/Tutorial/schema.html

I would appreciate any feedback on how this model could better
suit your needs. That said, I am not looking to model all the
myriad ways in which HTTP allows you to build a RESTful interface.
I think a more constrained model is needed to enable analysis and
more automated interoperation.

I agree. I think a great deal of the friction is based on
illogical arguments. With a more rigorous model, these arguments
could be more easily and decisively refuted.

This is cool, Mark!

I think you might have it backwards, though --- wouldn't it be cool to 
be able to generate Tarawa Resource subclasses from declarative 
descriptions?  Instead of extracting the documentation from the code, 
generate the code (and possibly its glue to persistent storage, ORM, 
presentation layer stuff, etc.) from the documentation?

My current short-term holy grail is the following:  Deepfile's 
management interface is currently a (not-very-RESTful, unfortunately) 
Web app but the juicy bits are the metadata repository we create over a 
set of filesystems.  I've got four eventual goals:  (1) I'd like for my 
dev team to be less in the Web app business and more in the filesystem 
management domain business.  (2) In pursuit of that, I'd like to be 
able to describe MVC declaratively and focus on modeling and 
specification rather than gluing abstraction layers together w/ code.  
We're already 60% of the way to automating the model piece of things 
from a formal declarative spec / description;  I'd like to do the same 
thing on the UI state flow, presentation, etc. fronts.  (3) I'd like to 
expose the underlying domain object model in a RESTful fashion, to ease 
integration friction down the road.  (4) There are several kinds of 
models that need to be mapped in my problem space:  the "hierarchical" 
(really network) database model of networked filesystems, the 
underlying relational storage for the metadata repository, the object 
model inside the application server, and (eventually) a semantic model 
that unifies these, probably RDF-based.  Right now all that mapping is 
impedance mismatch;  simplifying, unifying, or even eliminating some of 
those models and mappings is highly desirable.

Things like sqlREST, Tarawa, Dan's work, and so forth are conceptual 
puzzle pieces in a kind of generic solution to the problems I (and many 
others in lots of application domains!) am struggling with today.  I 
may end up having to fabricate many if not most of the pieces myself, 
but I think we're all driving towards some very similar goals or, even 
when the goals differ, there's a lot of overlap in the paths. :-)

You and Mark Baker were just involved in a go-round of this

could be added to a purchase order application. I have seen
similar answers in the past. I suspect the critics will remain
unsatisfied with this response and the permathread will continue
another day.

With a rigorous model, it could be more convincingly shown that a
REST model is at least as expressive as a SOAP-based model. For
example, in the web-calculus spec, I show that the web-calculus
encompases the functionality of DEM. See:

Thanks for spelling that out.  I'm not sure I share your
optimism in this, although I do like models myself.  The problem
is that group is adept at avoiding the stimulae that result in
a change of position, and they're getting better and better with
practice.

The people who really want to learn REST end up on this list
throwing stones at it until either they win or they learn.  Most if
not all also dabble in concrete implementations of the pattern. You
don't see the WSA group members doing that;  I think it's doubly
doubtful they'd engage in a formal models-based inquiry.

Thanks for the reference; I want to check it out when I get

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Actually, this is on my to-do list under the name "RDF Forms".

Basically, a way to declare parameterized (not just NV pairs) state
transitions via GET or POST (or extended POST), just like HTML forms,
only for RDF and SOAP.

It shouldn't be too difficult, I don't believe.  I just have to get
off my a$$.

Subject:Why REST for posting?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi. I've tried to find an explanation why I should
implement REST for a "posting service" (like Blogger).
At the RPC to REST wiki there are some hints but
still, I don't get it.
The GET thing with "smart" URLs and making things
transparent I get, it's like a command line URL.
My question is, what advantages are there using REST
for posting?

I think it is important to differentiate between things that the

it allows but assumes nobody will do.  Tim has a lot of axioms

Universality is one of them -- the principle that doing it well
enough in one place suggests that nobody else should duplicate
the same functionality, since duplication can be harmful.

Nope, that's about right.  Should the architectural style prevent

Sure, that's fair enough.  But given that so many people are as excited
about Web services as they are, perhaps we shouldn't underestimate some
folks' proclivity for shooting feet? 8-)

<pre>[Sorry Jeff, I first posted a reply but sent it to you alone not the

It seems like RDF Schema would be a good way to describe any URI 
based web service. For the case of simple GET, you would simply 
supply RDFS describing your schema. For the case of PUT/POST/GET 
with query parameters, you could invent a REST RDF vocabulary 
describing the accepted and returned documents. Below would be a 
description of a reservations service:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" 
xmlns:rest="http://hughw.net/20030524/rest-schema#"&gt;
	&lt;rest:Service 
rdf:about="http://www.bigreservations.com/service"&gt;
		&lt;rest:Method&gt;POST&lt;/rest:Method&gt;
		&lt;rest:Accept rdf:type="#ReservationRequest"/&gt;
		&lt;rest:Response rdf:type="#ReservationResponse"/&gt;
	&lt;/rest:Service&gt;
	&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID="ReservationRequest"/&gt;
	&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID="ReservationResponse"/&gt;
	&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID="CustomerID"/&gt;
	&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID="FlightID"/&gt;
	&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID="ReservationID"/&gt;
	&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID="Customer"&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#ReservationRequest"/&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource="#CustomerID"/&gt;
	&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
	&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID="Flight"&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#ReservationRequest"/&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource="#FlightID"/&gt;
	&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
	&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID="Reservation"&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#ReservationResponse"/&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource="#ReservationID"/&gt;
	&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

You would have to design markup describing how to map e.g. the 
ReservationResponse class to some xml schema. (Mapping Definition 
Language is one approach to that problem, could be overkill here).

SSL is just fine for 99.9% of real world applications. And that
includes strategic business to business integration services. Many
businesses today run RosettaNet over SSL (I'm tempted to say most RN
implementations do but all I can say is 100% of my small sample [4] do).

The article suggests that using SSL makes it impossible to implement
non-repudiation schemes because you can't get at the encrypted bits.
But non-repudiation schemes I have dealt with of rely on digesting the
plain text of the message. You can send a signed multipart message or
use XMLDSIG across SSL and that is as reliable a nonrepudiation scheme
as any -- you don't need to digest the encrypted bits. 

As far as encryption goes, few scenarios gain anything from encrypting
the application level message as opposed to encrypting at the
transport level. The endpoint argument isn't really very interesting.
The article says ISPs often can't set up a multihomed server properly.
Set up a new endpoint or get a competent ISP! And I mean, are you
really running this strategic business app on a multihomed server your
ISP configures?

Ignoring performance issues for a moment, would it be more RESTful to

the caller may retrieve them?

Consider whether the list of items specified by 
"http://myserver/select-items?color=blue" changes over time. Seems like 
if the list *does* change,  returning the URIs gives the client a way to 
retrieve those items later even if the query no longer returns them 
(e.g. a discontinued item). If the list *doesn't* change, any advantage 
to returning URIs rather than the representations seems a little less 
obvious... and then if you bring performance back into the calculation, 
returning URIs implies at least another round trip.

Subject:Java support for WSDL http bindings<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm new to the group and like most newbies, am full of questions.  
The one most pressing to me at the moment is that, while I don't 
much care for SOAP and prefer a URI-based approach to services, I do 
see a need for something WSDL-like to support discovery and service 
registration.  What I am looking for is a Java tool that will take 
in a WSDL with URL bindings and generate an easy to use interface 
object to populate appropriate parameters in the http URI.

This object would provide methods 
like "getParameterList", "getParameterType", "setParmeter
(parmname)", etc.  Eventually, I'm looking at being able to resolve 
semantic differences between the requestor's vocabulary and the 
service provider vocabulary, but that's down the road.

I am happy to write the class  if it doesn't already exist, but was 
wondering if there were any tools out there for this sort of thing?  
SOAP seems to have them (it really needs them- otherwise no one 
would use it), but the URL bindings option in WSDL does not seem to 
have any tool support.

Help!  And does any of this make sense?

It all depends on your application requirements. There is a general
pattern here which I've seen a number of times. One possible solution
you have not mentioned is to return a list of items *together* with
the URIs that can be used to address those items individually - then
you get all the advantages of both approaches.

This is an example what I think of as a container GET pattern - do you
serailise the contents of the container, or just return a list of
pointers to each contained resource?

Subject:Nesting containers to a depth of ?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Can anyone give me some advice on the following...

I'm attempting to define REST-style interface for a system delivering 
genomic map data.  

Central to my design is the possibility of maps nesting one within 
the other. Thus a map is, potentially, a composite of other maps. 
Furthermore there may be many levels of nesting.  My question is, how 
can traversal up an down this hierarchy be carried out in a REST-ful 
manner? To illustrate:

http://bioinformatics/Map - returns details list of all maps

&lt;Maps&gt;
	&lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1"&gt;
		&lt;label&gt;Chromosome 1&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;locations 
href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location"/&gt;
	&lt;/Map&gt;
	... thousands of Map nodes ...
	&lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"&gt;
		&lt;label&gt;Chromosome Z&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;locations 
href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location"/&gt;
	&lt;/Map&gt;
&lt;/Maps&gt;
		 

http://bioinformatics/Map/123 - returns a specific map
&lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"&gt;
	&lt;label&gt;Clone Z&lt;/label&gt;
	&lt;locations href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123/Location"/&gt;
&lt;/Map&gt;

Let's suppose that http://bioinformatics/Map/1 contains other maps 
(e.g. http://bioinformatics/Map/123). At present the way to retrieve 
a list of the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1 is to 
issue a GET to http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location. This returns a 
list of positional Locations on the map (i.e coordinates). Embedded 
within these locations are links to the parent map and the mappable 
(i.e. the Map located at this position):

&lt;Locations&gt;
	&lt;Location href="..."&gt;
		.... 
	&lt;Location&gt;
	.... thousands of Location nodes ...
	&lt;Location href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location/10"&gt;
		&lt;position&gt;0.2&lt;/position&gt;
		&lt;map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1"/&gt;
		&lt;mappable href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"/&gt;
	&lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/Locations&gt;

Using the links provided in a Location node it should be possible to 
traverse the graph of Maps.

To my mind this is consistent with the REST-ful idea of gradually 
revealing data. Applications wishing to use the data should certainly 
be relatively simple to write and the consistency of the interface 
appeals to me. However, this scheme has the disadvantage of, 
potentially, requiring many GET requests to traverse the graph. This 
is mainly because the 'hierarchy' is not a simple tree or forest - a 
map be contained by more than one map. While mutliple GET's shouldn't 
be an issue for any client keeping a connection to the server open, 
I'd like to avoid any such requirement. Thus, I'd like to extend the 
interface such that it is possible to traverse the graph of Maps, 
bypassing the intermediate step of accessing Locations (the Location 
data may not be of much interest to a client in any case). Is there 
any sensible way to represent such a traversal? So far I've thought 
of defining two new resources, Maps ( = Containers) and Mappables ( = 
Contents), to make such traversal possible. By specifying in the URI 
the resource to which movement should be relative, traversal up or 
down the hierarchy should be possible. For example:


http://bionformatics/Maps/Map/123  - would return a list of Maps that 
contain http://bioinformatics/Map/123.

and

http://bioinformatics/Mappables/Map/1 - would return a list of all 
the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1


Does this scheme make sense? Although it seems distinctly un-REST 
like, it does allow me to do what I want to do. Mmmm... should I even 
want to do what I want to do?

Thanks in advance.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Nesting containers to a depth of ?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Richard

My comments are:

1. The presence of location elements (that represent a specific schema design) in the web pages implies knowledge of implementation details, which goes against the grain of REST-ful architectures. Hence, to eliminate this, each web page should only contain (apart from other static, formatting and similar content) URIs to Resources. When you "click" on a URI, that "opens" another web page containing yet some more links, and so on. How the web page is generated and how it obtains access to the resources should be completely hidden from the "users". Thus, details of your schema or interfaces should not appear in your page design.

2. Given this, you may probably want to refactor your code so that the implementation details are moved out of the REST-ful "pages" (that represent the web service you are making available).

Does this make sense, or am I missing the point?

<pre>I don't think there's anything wrong with the scheme Richard proposed.  If
users
have a mental model of these maps, then I see nothing wrong with exposing
them in
all their bizarre containment glory through a REST interface.  Even if they
don't
start out with that mental model, it's valid to introduce it as an access
paradigm
to aid the client in expressing intent.

The one quibble I have with Richard's proposal is mainly syntactic.

&gt;http://bionformatics/Maps/Map/123  - would return a list of Maps that
&gt;contain http://bioinformatics/Map/123.

I think more in terms of http://bionformatics/Map/123/Parents
(or some other suitable noun in place of "Parents").

&gt;and

&gt;http://bioinformatics/Mappables/Map/1 - would return a list of all
&gt;the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1

And the corresponding http://bionformatics/Map/1/Children
(or some such suitable noun)

In other words, the conceptual hierarchy and the names used in it
can include inversions of the normalized view of the space, and there's
no law against having multiple names for the same resource, either.

Hi Richard

My comments are:

1. The presence of location elements (that represent a specific schema
design) in the web pages implies knowledge of implementation details, which
goes against the grain of REST-ful architectures. Hence, to eliminate this,
each web page should only contain (apart from other static, formatting and
similar content) URIs to Resources. When you "click" on a URI, that "opens"
another web page containing yet some more links, and so on. How the web page
is generated and how it obtains access to the resources should be completely
hidden from the "users". Thus, details of your schema or interfaces should
not appear in your page design.

2. Given this, you may probably want to refactor your code so that the
implementation details are moved out of the REST-ful "pages" (that represent
the web service you are making available).

Does this make sense, or am I missing the point?

Subject: [rest-discuss] Nesting containers to a depth of ?


Can anyone give me some advice on the following...

I'm attempting to define REST-style interface for a system delivering
genomic map data.

Central to my design is the possibility of maps nesting one within
the other. Thus a map is, potentially, a composite of other maps.
Furthermore there may be many levels of nesting.  My question is, how
can traversal up an down this hierarchy be carried out in a REST-ful
manner? To illustrate:

http://bioinformatics/Map - returns details list of all maps

&lt;Maps&gt;
      &lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1"&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Chromosome 1&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;locations
href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location"/&gt;
      &lt;/Map&gt;
      ... thousands of Map nodes ...
      &lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Chromosome Z&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;locations
href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location"/&gt;
      &lt;/Map&gt;
&lt;/Maps&gt;


http://bioinformatics/Map/123 - returns a specific map
&lt;Map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Clone Z&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;locations href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123/Location"/&gt;
&lt;/Map&gt;

Let's suppose that http://bioinformatics/Map/1 contains other maps
(e.g. http://bioinformatics/Map/123). At present the way to retrieve
a list of the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1 is to
issue a GET to http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location. This returns a
list of positional Locations on the map (i.e coordinates). Embedded
within these locations are links to the parent map and the mappable
(i.e. the Map located at this position):

&lt;Locations&gt;
      &lt;Location href="..."&gt;
            ....
      &lt;Location&gt;
      .... thousands of Location nodes ...
      &lt;Location href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location/10"&gt;
            &lt;position&gt;0.2&lt;/position&gt;
            &lt;map href="http://bioinformatics/Map/1"/&gt;
            &lt;mappable href="http://bioinformatics/Map/123"/&gt;
      &lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/Locations&gt;

Using the links provided in a Location node it should be possible to
traverse the graph of Maps.

To my mind this is consistent with the REST-ful idea of gradually
revealing data. Applications wishing to use the data should certainly
be relatively simple to write and the consistency of the interface
appeals to me. However, this scheme has the disadvantage of,
potentially, requiring many GET requests to traverse the graph. This
is mainly because the 'hierarchy' is not a simple tree or forest - a
map be contained by more than one map. While mutliple GET's shouldn't
be an issue for any client keeping a connection to the server open,
I'd like to avoid any such requirement. Thus, I'd like to extend the

<pre>Walden, Narayan

Thanks for the feedback. The point about syntax is appreciated. In 
fact I'd tried (probably mistakenly and ham fistedly) to simplify the 
issue when posting... The real interface uses Children, Siblings, and 
Parents as means of traversing the graph. Within the domain I'm 
concerned with such nouns can have various meanings and can end up 
confusing matters. Nonetheless, they seem to be appropriate in this 
case. It nice to have my thinking confirmed.

With respect to the elimination of Location elements, I agree that 
the ideal would be to remove them. For historical reasons they serve 
more than one purpose at present. However, pragmatism and time 
constraints mean that I'll maintain them for now, possibly splitting 
the geometric information from the links at a later date. Advice 
noted and filed for reference.

Richard

packages/vendors with an HTTP rest-like interface for adding point or

<pre>First of all, excuse my english, I am dutch.  I joined this group 
because I am interested in REST, there seem to be several good ideas 
here.

I have a webservice that is something like an online civilization 
game.  Users can conquer land, cities, build things there, explore 
maps, etc.  How do you design something like that RESTful?  Can 
something like that be done?  I am using Python for cgi scripts, 
generating HTML with CSS inline (by means of style attributes).  The 
main thing I don't understand is how to give a player access to 
his/her cities, and denying other players access to those cities.  
HTTPS could be available.  As it is now, the webapplication starts 
with asking a username+password combo, and as I understand it that 
is already against REST principles?

I am going to make an argument otherwise.

In section 5.2.1.1 of your dissertation, you open with:

"The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any
information that can be named can be a resource: ..."

Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a
URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user
account). Therefore, this information is not a resource.
Therefore, the application is not RESTful. Conclusion: ACLs are
not RESTful.

It isn't.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.
A server can and will take into account the entire request when
determining which representation should be sent in response to
a request, just as it does so for determining whether the response
should be 200 or 401.

&gt; Therefore, the application is not RESTful. Conclusion: ACLs are

That is a bizarre conclusion.  If that were the case, I would have put
a section in the dissertation explaining why one of the central features
of HTTP isn't modeled by REST.

I used the term "information" because that is the term you used in

In the original email, you wrote:

&gt; No, that is not against REST principles.  Access control and
&gt; authorization
&gt; are the normal way of doing user-specific services.

If HTTP Auth is used to make a user-specific service, the
resulting "resource" is named using the combination of the URI
and the username + password. The URI alone cannot be used to name
the "resource". This means the "resource" is not a real resource.
It is not part of the global URI namespace.

If the user were willing to abdicate their entire user account,
they could use the &lt;userinfo&gt; part of the URI syntax to include
their username + password in the URI. I am assuming that this is
not a viable option.

As a simple demonstration of this, note that it not feasible for
you to create hyperlinks to any of the "resources" in your online
bank account. This is true despite the fact that you have access
to these "resources", using a normal WWW client. The failure of
this application to obey REST design principles has prevented the
user from sharing information in the normal WWW way.

&gt; &gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.
&gt;
&gt; It isn't.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.
&gt; A server can and will take into account the entire request when
&gt; determining which representation should be sent in response to
&gt; a request, just as it does so for determining whether the response
&gt; should be 200 or 401.

The "resource" that is the user-specific resource is not a
resource. You seem to be saying that it is RESTful for the origin
server to say the resource is the conglomeration of all user's
user-specific resources. If you take this stance, you diminish the
power of REST, since the web of resources is central to REST.
Making everything one big resource defeats this.

This argument is closely related to the REST argument against
using proprietary identifiers inside the body of a request. The
REST view is that the URI is *THE* identifier. This is necessary
to enable hyperlinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In section 5.2.1.1 of your dissertation, you open with:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; "The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any
&gt;&gt;&gt; information that can be named can be a resource: ..."
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a
&gt;&gt;&gt; URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user
&gt;&gt;&gt; account).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The URI identifies the resource, not the information that is
&gt;&gt; sent in response to a GET on that resource.
&gt;
&gt; I used the term "information" because that is the term you used in
&gt; the quoted section of your dissertation.

It isn't the *only* information in REST.  The identified information
is an abstraction. If I have a link to

    http://bigbank.com/services/myaccount

then it is identifying the same abstraction regardless of the number
of different users that might receive different bytes in response
to successfully authenticating and accessing that resource via GET.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; As such, I don't
&gt;&gt; understand what you mean by abdicating the user account.
&gt;
&gt; In the original email, you wrote:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, that is not against REST principles.  Access control and
&gt;&gt; authorization
&gt;&gt; are the normal way of doing user-specific services.
&gt;
&gt; If HTTP Auth is used to make a user-specific service, the
&gt; resulting "resource" is named using the combination of the URI
&gt; and the username + password. The URI alone cannot be used to name
&gt; the "resource". This means the "resource" is not a real resource.
&gt; It is not part of the global URI namespace.

I think you need to go back and figure out what "resource" means
instead of assuming that it is the information resulting from
a request.

&gt; If the user were willing to abdicate their entire user account,
&gt; they could use the &lt;userinfo&gt; part of the URI syntax to include
&gt; their username + password in the URI. I am assuming that this is
&gt; not a viable option.

Right, it isn't.  But do you see why the URI supplied above is not
user-specific even though its response may be?  Likewise, the URI

    http://bigbank.com/services/account/1234565432

is not user-specific even if only one user in the universe has
access rights to GET responses on that URI.

&gt; As a simple demonstration of this, note that it not feasible for
&gt; you to create hyperlinks to any of the "resources" in your online
&gt; bank account. This is true despite the fact that you have access
&gt; to these "resources", using a normal WWW client. The failure of
&gt; this application to obey REST design principles has prevented the
&gt; user from sharing information in the normal WWW way.

No, that isn't true in general -- it depends entirely upon how the
app UI was designed.  Most such systems use a frame or an appserver
session that hides the URI; that isn't RESTful, but it has nothing
to so with the access control part.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It isn't.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.
&gt;&gt; A server can and will take into account the entire request when
&gt;&gt; determining which representation should be sent in response to

&gt; user-specific resources. If you take this stance, you diminish the
&gt; power of REST, since the web of resources is central to REST.
&gt; Making everything one big resource defeats this.

It doesn't defeat anything that wasn't already defeated by the
nature of the application: the page cannot be placed in a
shared cached.

The purpose of REST is to model how the Web is supposed to work.
If I were to take the stance that access control doesn't fit the
REST model, then it wouldn't be the right model.  User-specific
responses via access control are no different than negotiated
response by conneg, except that access-controlled resources
default to not-shared-cacheable.

&gt; This argument is closely related to the REST argument against
&gt; using proprietary identifiers inside the body of a request. The
&gt; REST view is that the URI is *THE* identifier. This is necessary
&gt; to enable hyperlinks.

The URI is still *THE* identifier.  It identifies the same thing
regardless of who uses the URI.  But that has only an indirect
relation to the information returned in response to GET on that
resource.  If the application wishes to provide an account-specific
URI, such as the second one above, then it can certainly choose
to do so via a redirect after the initial access control exchange.
However, that doesn't make it any more (or less) RESTful.

A related example is

     file://localhost/etc/host

What is that resource?  If you think it is the file on your own
Unix-based system, you would be mistaken.  URIs identify interfaces,
not implementations.

In this thread, we are interested in the granularity of the
abstraction identified by the URL.

Let's use a different example to make the point, and then relate
it back to the issues created by HTTP Auth.

Say there is a web site that hosts multiple documents. The web
site has a single URL for its home page.  The site determines
which particular document to respond with based on a string
contained in the body of the request.

We would all agree that such a web site is not RESTful. Since the
site does not present a collection of identifiable resources, it
is impossible to make hyperlinks to particular documents.

HTTP Auth similarly aggregates multiple logical resources under
the same URL. There is a significant loss of granularity in the
abstraction identified by the URL. Just like the RESTless web
site, the HTTP Auth application makes it infeasible to make
hyperlinks to the logical resources.

&gt; User-specific
&gt; responses via access control are no different than negotiated
&gt; response by conneg, except that access-controlled resources
&gt; default to not-shared-cacheable.

This is false. Conneg only changes the format used for the
produced representation, it does not loosen the granularity of the
identified abstraction. When you use HTTP Auth to determine the
user-specific, logical resource for a request, you loosen the
granularity of the URI. If you have 2 users on the same URI, you
do not have a URI for each user-specific logical resource. You
have taken what could be 2 resources and made them one. Combining
multiple logical resources into a single resource is not RESTful;
it defeats the creation of a web.

&gt; The purpose of REST is to model how the Web is supposed to work.
&gt; If I were to take the stance that access control doesn't fit the
&gt; REST model, then it wouldn't be the right model.

This is not the stance I am arguing for. Access control and HTTP
Auth are not synonymous. There are other ways of implementing
access control.

I am arguing that the way access control is popularly implemented
on the WWW is not RESTful. I am making my argument based on the
principles presented in your dissertation.

&gt; It doesn't defeat anything that wasn't already defeated by the
&gt; nature of the application:

This is also false. The application MUST initially give the bank
account holder sole access to the application resources. There is
no reason why the user should not be allowed to voluntarily share
some of those resources with other users. You present a black and
white view of totally private, or totally public resources. This
view is too simple. Many useful resources are subject to
discretionary sharing. HTTP Auth prevents discretionary sharing by
users.  This constraint is not part of generic application
requirements.

To clarify this debate I have broken my argument down into a
progression of simple statements:

1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.
2. A user-specific resource is an important resource.
3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific
resources.
4. This use of HTTP Auth amalgamates user-specific resources under
a shared URI.
5. Such use of HTTP Auth is RESTless.

You are very close to the point. You just demonstrated an
important use of giving user-specific resources their own URI. I
am arguing in favour of this.

I am arguing against URIs like
&lt;http://www.acmebank.com/accounts/current/12/&gt;, where this URI
refers the 12th most recent payment made by a particular user.

i think your point (that such URIs are RESTless) can be more
clearly made by stating that the only way that the 'current'

access to some server-side state, or a session.

this of course is RESTless all by itself because the server has

<pre>This discussion needs to be much clearer about what the resource in 
question is. AFAICS the example is an 'account' resource.

The URI need not be the only factor in determining /who's/ account we 
are talking about - the server may take into account any of the other 
request headers to determine this. Of course it is easier to understand 
the application if the information is all in the URI, but using other 
headers does not break a REST constraint.

It is not the URI on its own that I am arguing against. It is the
absence of the user-specific resource URI that I am arguing
against. I am arguing against using HTTP Auth as a resource
identification supplement. The example URL is an example of a URL
that requires supplemental resource identification information in
order to provide any function.

An application may very well provide container URLs, in addition
to user-specific URLs, and be RESTful. It is the absence of the
user-specific URLs that is RESTless.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Tyler, Mark, Roy,

a. Cookie dependent URIs are inherently restless

-or-

b. (http-)authentication  is inherently restless
   (401s considered RESTless)

-or-

c. Cookie/http-auth based *authorization* is inherently restless
   (403s and 405s considered RESTless)

You all appear to be arguing for or against one of
these positions, but it is not clear which.

Here is an example to clarify this distinction.
The choice is between

(1) CookieBank uses cookies or auth to provide
access to a customer payment at URL:

  http://CookieBank.com/accounts/payments/12

(2) RestBank tops CookieBank by making URIs for
specific payments visible in the "Location" bar
so users can forward them to others:

  http://RestBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12

(3) RestAuthenticateBank claims superiority over
RestBank because it logs who accesses forwarded
URIs and who POSTs "Cancel" or "Confirm" to them:

  http://RestAuthenticateBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12

(4) AuthorizeBank claims to be the best because
its URIs are unforwardable.  Users who want to
provide their accountant access to a particular
payment can do so.  Those user's can also be sure
that the accountant does not delegate handling to
some intern:

  http://AuthorizeBank.com/account/user123/payments/12?user=user456

  Note: Only the user authenticated as user456 may
  access this URI!

My opinion:

REST and Authentication are orthogonal, but that
people frequently abuse authentication to make it
unrestful.  So, RESTAuthenticateBank is RESTful,
but CookieBank is not.

AuthorizeBank is also RESTful.  There is a
substantive difference between the specificity of
a URI and whether one can access it.  There are no
status codes that indicate that the body returned
is dependent on a cookie/auth.  However, there are
status codes to indicate availability for
particular purposes, e.g. 403 Forbidden, 404 Not
Found, 405 Not Allowed.

CookieBank WOULD be restful if it sent a
content-location header that specified the URI of
the underlying resource.  However, it would be
annoying to have to check for the existence of
this header to determine which URI to forward.
(Question: Is it legal to use content-location
header for this purpose?  If the customer forwards
the HTML version of the resource, can the
accountant access it with an accept: header to
retrieve the PDF version instead?)

&gt; &gt; &gt; ah.  thanks for that clarification.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i think your point (that such URIs are RESTless) can be more
&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly made by stating that the only way that the 'current'
&gt; &gt; &gt; account alluded to in your URI can be dereferenced is by having
&gt; &gt; &gt; access to some server-side state, or a session.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; this of course is RESTless all by itself because the server has
&gt; &gt; &gt; to maintain that state using a gross hack (cf. cookies).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If it's a URI, then there's nothing at all RESTless about it.  That
&gt; &gt; URI is perfectly fine, even if what you GET from it differs depending
&gt; &gt; upon who invoked GET, the time of day, etc..  To say otherwise is
&gt; &gt; to prevent me from identifying a whole class of useful resources,
&gt; &gt; such as "The person to my right", "The colour of the next traffic
&gt; &gt; light up ahead", etc..
&gt;
&gt; It is not the URI on its own that I am arguing against. It is the
&gt; absence of the user-specific resource URI that I am arguing
&gt; against. I am arguing against using HTTP Auth as a resource
&gt; identification supplement. The example URL is an example of a URL
&gt; that requires supplemental resource identification information in
&gt; order to provide any function.
&gt;
&gt; An application may very well provide container URLs, in addition
&gt; to user-specific URLs, and be RESTful. It is the absence of the
&gt; user-specific URLs that is RESTless.

Trying to decide how many resources there are behind a URL is kind of an 
angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin question. But it is demonstrably necessary 
to make URLs to things that behave differently for different people 
(whether different because of conneg, or language sniffing, or HTTP 
version or username/password or ...)

 From a UI point of view it is important to be clear with the user about 
what the resource is.

But we're somewhat far afield of what the user asked. Can the system 
deny access to other people's cities? The answer is clearly that REST 
allows this. Tyler's favorite security model may not, but REST has no 
problem with it. The issue of whether the user sees their own cities at 
a user-specific URL or user-generic URL is separate.

Unfortunately, REST only says "important" resources should have a
URI. This leaves us with a subjective test.

I take it from your response that you believe user-specific
resources are not "important" and that you see no value in the
example offered by Vincent D. Murphy?

As for the original example, if the application is designed
without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to
even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign
travel is overrated anyways.

&gt; But it is demonstrably necessary
&gt; to make URLs to things that behave differently for different people
&gt; (whether different because of conneg, or language sniffing, or HTTP
&gt; version or username/password or ...)

I would like to see your demonstration that HTTP Auth is necessary
to the REST model. I would also like to see your rebuttal to my
argument that using HTTP Auth to provide user-specific responses
violates REST principles. I provided my argument in 5 simple
steps.  Show me yours.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] URIs are RESTful<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; You all appear to be arguing for or against one of
&gt; these positions, but it is not clear which.

Not really.  I was arguing against a claim that simply is not
true about REST.

&gt; Here is an example to clarify this distinction.
&gt; The choice is between
&gt;
&gt; (1) CookieBank uses cookies or auth to provide
&gt; access to a customer payment at URL:
&gt;
&gt;   http://CookieBank.com/accounts/payments/12

That is not a likely scenario.  Applications working within an
account context will typically use a company-unique payment ID or
one that is account-specific.  A more realistic example is the "top"
page, which is often made account-generic specifically because
the company wants customers to bookmark a single URI for the
initial access point.  It is not identified with an account
number because the user is going to choose from their accounts
after visiting that page.

&gt; (2) RestBank tops CookieBank by making URIs for
&gt; specific payments visible in the "Location" bar
&gt; so users can forward them to others:
&gt;
&gt;   http://RestBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12

The purpose would be for auditing, not sharing transactions.

&gt; My opinion:
&gt;
&gt; REST and Authentication are orthogonal, but that
&gt; people frequently abuse authentication to make it
&gt; unrestful.  So, RESTAuthenticateBank is RESTful,
&gt; but CookieBank is not.

Authentication is orthogonal.  Cookies are also orthogonal when
they are simply used for content negotiation or authentication.
However, Cookie authentication is not allowed in REST because it
lacks visibility, which causes security problems because the other
components don't know it is sensitive information.

If the semantics of the request is determined by the contents of
authentication or cookies, then that in non-RESTful.  All of the
examples I used were requests with the semantics determined entirely
by the URI and only the response content determined by the request
metadata. That is why the exchange remains RESTful, because the URI
is universally applicable (means the same thing) for other users
even though the content exchanged will be user-specific.  Likewise,
a user-specific URI that is access-controlled for a single user
is universally applicable even if the rest of the universe is denied
access -- the semantics are clear from the request method and URI.

&gt; CookieBank WOULD be restful if it sent a
&gt; content-location header that specified the URI of
&gt; the underlying resource.

No, content-location was an attempt to set the base URI for
embedded relative URIs, but it has not been implemented sufficiently
to make it useful for even that purpose.  It cannot be used to
compensate for multi-semantic URIs, such as a single URI being
used for many different types of request via POST, because
visibility of those actions must occur in the request (prior
to the response being generated).

Preempting Paul....

There are occasions when you want to restrict or control who has access to 
a resource.
How would you provide the services of RestAuthenticateBank or AuthorizeBank 
without HTTP-auth or an equivalent mechanism?

Note: You could be right that use of these mechanisms is un-RESTful, but 
that would make REST pretty useless.

Unfortunately this is unavoidable. Similarly in an OO language you would

opposed to being embedded in strings, for example).

&gt; I take it from your response that you believe user-specific
&gt; resources are not "important" and that you see no value in the
&gt; example offered by Vincent D. Murphy?

Not at all. My point is that if Roy defines a service and says that the 
URI "/mybooks" represents the current user's books and that is a single 
resource then consumers have to treat that as the defined interface. You 
can't argue "really that's two resources". It isn't. It is one resource 
that happens to serve very different representations to different users. 
But you could _separately_ make an engineering argument that it would be 
more useful if there were multiple resources. Sure, given a set of goals 
and requirements for a system that is probably the right engineering 
choice. My point was that it is not productive for two people to argue 
whether a given URL has N or M resources behind it.

My rule of thumb is that the thing has multiple resources behind it if 
you have to invent a new addressing scheme to talk about the things, and 
you start embedding those addresses in XML documents or passing them 
around as parameters to APIs etc.

&gt; As for the original example, if the application is designed
&gt; without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to
&gt; even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign
&gt; travel is overrated anyways.

I would presume that every city has its own URL and the only question is 
whether every user is allowed to see every city or whether they get an 
authorization complaint. That's why I think that the discussion about 
user-specific URLs is a little bit of a tangent.

&gt; 1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.

Great.

&gt; 2. A user-specific resource is an important resource.

Great.

&gt; 3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific
&gt; resources.

HTTP auth can be used to do two things. One is to disallow access to a 
resource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let's say I send you a 
URL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect 
example). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a 
preference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a 
usability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for 
it and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.

Conversely, it could be quite confusing if the URL behaves totally 
differently for me than for you (not just different colours but totally 
different content). On the other hand, if this is part of the contract 
of the resource ("We use your user name as the seed for a random number 
generator before we generate you a random quote") then fair enough.

You're presuming that each personalized representation is its own 
resource. That's the point that Walden is trying to get across. The 
Slashdot home page is the Slashdot home page whether it is in English or 
French (presuming that Slashdot was not totally US-centric), whether the 
user has asked Google to turn off images or not, whether the user has 
asked Google to use a blue background or a red one.

True, I cannot send you a URL and have you see Slashdot exactly the same 
way I do. If this is important then Slashdot could generate "view" URLs 
that always returns the same view. But this is clearly not important for 
Slashdot so they don't bother.

One issue with the Web is that people tend not to be explicit about what 
resource the URI represents so you are left to guess about the 
universality and longevity of a representation you are looking at. You 
could imagine an interface that would allow end-users to generate a 
URI/resource with the capabilities you want:

"I'd like a URI for the Slashdot home page as it was three seconds ago 
with my personalization applied (no matter who the user is)."

versus

"I'd like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it 
and my personalization applied (no matter who the user is)."

versus

"I'd like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it 
and the user's personalization applied."

This is probably overkill for 99% of all web sites so it isn't common. 
But it shows how to address this personalization versus universality 
issue. Just make some resources personalized and some universal.

<pre>Paul,

I buy all that, and yet I still have an issue with Tyler's example
of the bank account URI that identifies anyone's account at that
bank, depending on who's fired up their user agent.  To me, the
account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)
has identity that transcends the clever "my account" resource,
and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former
than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.

Then there's that temple somewhere in the Orient that moves itself
among two or more eligible plots, but it's the same temple where-
ever it's standing.  The identity of the temple is different for worshipers
than it is for the construction crew, and the HTTP authority is yet
another party to reckon with.

If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want
the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won't be dragging
any URI into court.

Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed 
messages_ into courts. Let's say you have a very precise (specific) and 
  URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation. 
Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed. 
The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it 
in the database. You'll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally

arrive at the homepage for my account:

This page has my current balance, available

I can also link to a printable version of my

Both printable versions are simply current records

I'd like to be able to provide third parties
(e.g. my accountant) with access to these pages,
but I can't without providing them with control

The questions are:
1. Is this system RESTful?
2. Would it be RESTful if it used HTTP-auth rather than cookie auth?

<pre>I think the RESTful-ness of these systems falls into a gray
area that exists because the durability of identity is also a gray
area.  You could offer test cases in which two consecutive GETs
on the same URI yield unacceptably different representations,
indicating that no *identity* was backing them.  You can find many
test cases where there seems to be a backing *identity*.  And
notice that there are different perspectives for forming judgments
about when there is backing identity and when there is not.

Is the system unRESTful, or am I a wacky authority with a bent
view of identity that doesn't fit with the rest of the world?  You
can certainly stretch the concept of identity too far for general
consumption.

I don't think the court use case is a red herring.  It represents a
possible worst case scenario for resolving what constitutes an acceptable
notion of identity in a formalized business environment using the web.
In other words, a dot com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I buy all that, and yet I still have an issue with Tyler's example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the bank account URI that identifies anyone's account at that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bank, depending on who's fired up their user agent.  To me, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has identity that transcends the clever "my account" resource,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I
want
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won't be
dragging
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; any URI into court.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed
&gt; &gt; &gt; messages_ into courts. Let's say you have a very precise (specific)
and
&gt; &gt; &gt;   URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the database. You'll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally
&gt; &gt; &gt; signed message with the old value.

Well, it was in response to part of Paul's message, and seems quite
relevant.  It's perhaps only partially relevant to what you ask here
though.

&gt; In real life, I have a http://universalcard.com
&gt; credit card.  When I log in (via a web form), I
&gt; arrive at the homepage for my account:
&gt; 
&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary
&gt; 
&gt; This page has my current balance, available
&gt; credit, last payment made, and last payment date,
&gt; among other information.  There is also a link on
&gt; that page to:
&gt; 
&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary?PRINT_VERSION=Y
&gt; 
&gt; I can also link to a printable version of my
&gt; unbilled transactions:
&gt; 
&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/UnbilledTrans?PRINT_VERSION=Y
&gt; 
&gt; Both printable versions are simply current records
&gt; of my account state without any links/buttons to
&gt; make changes.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to be able to provide third parties
&gt; (e.g. my accountant) with access to these pages,
&gt; but I can't without providing them with control
&gt; over my entire account.
&gt; 
&gt; The questions are:
&gt; 1. Is this system RESTful?

Good question.  REST has an interface constraint called "identification
of resources", and there is clearly a resource in your example which is
not being identified ("The summary of Alex's account").  Roy's
dissertation is a bit vague with respect to what this constraint
actually constrains, so it's hard for me to say with any certainty.

But my hunch is that it is still RESTful, but with an obvious bug that
an important resource isn't identified.  It would be unRESTful if,
for example, cookies were used to define the context for interpretation
of that indirect reference (whether that was authentication info, or
anything else).

&gt; 2. Would it be RESTful if it used HTTP-auth rather than cookie auth?

If it used cookie auth, it wouldn't be RESTful.

1. Yes, it is RESTful, but it is lacking a feature that would be useful 
to you. It would be easy to extend the system with the feature you ask 
for. There could be a button that says: "universal link".

Conversely, if there was _only_ the universal link then your accountant 
could not send you a URI and say: "Click this to see your unbilled 
transactions."

But it is hard to imagine how this would work from a UI point of view. 
There are serious security implications. Would a typical user understand 
how to give someone else read permissions to a single page and not to 
the whole account? Or would the universal link be truly universal (i.e. 
not ACL-protected at all)? Arguably it is easier for you to send the 
page to your accountant by email (send by value rather than send by 
reference).

If identity is confusing to geeks imagine how it would be to end-users 
if we started trying to give them every possible option. (but on the 
other hand, the pervasive concept of "permalink" shows that some people 
are innovating around issues of resource identity UI)

2. In this case I don't see the relevance of which of the two 
authorization regimes you use.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Identification of resources<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Crikey, you guys are getting all mixed up.  REST is defined by
my dissertation.  REST is not defined by the TAG discussion or
the W3C's Webarch document or TimBL's design notes.  REST is an
architectural style, not the Web architecture.  Please try
to keep the terminology consistent.

REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.
REST merely requires that actions be applied to an identified resource,
and that identification be in the form of a resource identifier (rather
than, for example, a sequence of events).  Obviously, if you do not
have an identifier for a given resource, then you cannot interact
with it directly in REST, which means you can't do things like share
that specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form
of audit reference (you can't do that anyway -- you need all of the
information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,
method, authentication token, etc.).

That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,
conversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect
actions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are
trade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued
resource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more
specific resource before further actions take place, but both are
fully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be
vague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly
when a component has yet to determine the specific URI.

I am making the engineering argument. I am arguing about how to
design RESTful applications.

&gt; My rule of thumb is that the thing has multiple resources behind it if
&gt; you have to invent a new addressing scheme to talk about the things, and
&gt; you start embedding those addresses in XML documents or passing them
&gt; around as parameters to APIs etc.

A username is an identifier that exists in an address space
separate from the URI address space.

&gt; &gt; As for the original example, if the application is designed
&gt; &gt; without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to
&gt; &gt; even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign
&gt; &gt; travel is overrated anyways.
&gt;
&gt; I would presume that every city has its own URL and the only question is
&gt; whether every user is allowed to see every city or whether they get an
&gt; authorization complaint.

You can only make this presumption if there is an established and
adhered to convention that it is RESTless to do otherwise. Are you
ready to declare so?

&gt; &gt; 1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.
&gt;
&gt; Great.

I was very surprised to read that Roy does not agree with us. See:

Roy, are you saying that the "must" is a "should"? I used
"should", not "must". If you wish to even further weaken the
constraint, I think you should provide clear and objective
guidance on when an important resource need not have an
identifier. If you have already done so, please provide a link.

If you accept points 1 and 2, the argument is made. Points 3 to 5
simply draw out the consequences of 1 and 2. Given points 1 and 2,
it is RESTless to not give a user-specific resource a URI.

&gt; &gt; 3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific
&gt; &gt; resources.
&gt;
&gt; HTTP auth can be used to do two things. One is to disallow access to a
&gt; resource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let's say I send you a
&gt; URL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect
&gt; example). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a
&gt; preference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a
&gt; usability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for
&gt; it and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.

Again, I am not arguing against container URLs. I am arguing
against the absence of user-specific URLs.

I am also not arguing that Slashdot should actually implement a
user-specific URL for its home page. I am only arguing that it is
RESTless for Slashdot to not do so. In this case, it is likely
that this RESTless design will have no negative consequences.
This result will not always be the same. The more "important" the
resource, the more likely it is that RESTless design will have
negative consequences. RESTless design of a less "important"
resource may go unnoticed.

I suspect that RESTless design is more of a problem in a web
service than in a web site. A web site may have many appearance
variation resources that are not present in a web service.

Clear rules help us identify potential design problems and avert
them. This is the basis for engineering. You seem to be taking the
stance that a feel-good "anything goes" ruleset should be used.
This leaves REST without a real model or way of evaluating
designs.

It is OK to call things RESTless and still use them. However, if
you are unable to correctly categorize designs, you reduce your
ability to improve your designs. Let's drop the squeamishness
around calling things RESTless.

Subject:sharing my banking data<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>This has been a very interesting conversation.  For the fun of it, what
about the following architecture:

Premise: I want to access my banking information.  I also want to share bits
of it with my accountant.  The URL for the bank is http://my.bank.


1) I GET http://my.bank/access.  The server returns an HTTP Authentication
challenge
2) I re-submit the request with my credentials. The server authenticates me
and returns a 201 with a Location of http://my.bank/access/12345.

Note:  The returned URL is unique to me.  The HTTP Authentication headers
have no meaning at this point.  The URL has some constraints on its
existance. In this case, it only exists for 5 minutes between requests
(resetting the timer after each request).

3) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345.  The server returns the options
available to me:

    http://my.bank/access/12345/options
    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts
    http://my.bank/access/12345/reports

4) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts.  The server returns a list of
accounts:

    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking
    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/savings

5) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking.  The server returns
a list of transactions:

    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456
    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/455
    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/454

6) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456.  The server
returns the details of the transaction.

7) Also on the screen is an option that says "send this page to:" and an
input box.  I fill in my accountant's e-mail address, and press submit.  The
form is POSTed to http://my.bank/proxy-access.  The form contains two
fields:  the e-mail address and the current page's URL (which was
http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456).  The server e-mails the
following URL to my accountant: http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789.

Note:  The link generated for the accountant only provides access to the
given checking entry.  If I had wanted to give him access to my entire
checking account, I would have sent him
"http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking", except that the URL she
would have received would show that page instead, with the contained URLs
being:

    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/456
    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/455
    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/454

The e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit such as 30 minutes, after
which, the link will only return a 404 response or some such.

Now, if I wanted to revoke access, I could just issue a DELETE on the URL.
There isn't even any need to authenicate the DELETE request.  Likewise, if I
wanted to "log out", I could DELETE my own URL.  If I forgot, both URLs
would have a limited lifetime anyhow, at the end of which only a 404
response would be returned.


Obviously, this is a rather simple scenario.  But I think it illustrates a
simple, clean way of handling access in a RESTful manner.  Was this how
others were imagining that it might work?

I think there's a great deal to be gained from acknowledging that the
architecture of the Web is largely to create an effective *public* space. 
If a username separate from the URI is RESTless, I personally don't have a
problem with recognizing it.  The availability-of-personalization issue is
really something that arises in the area of private interest issues, like
some web services of the sort we've been discussing here.

&gt; Ok, is use of Vary RESTful and if so is it good REST style?
&gt;
&gt; "Vary" means that resources are addressable via a URI+mimeheaders and not
&gt; just a URI.
The resource is identified by the URI - the request header(s) were used to
return one of a variety of representations. Using content negotiation
(conneg) the Accept header can be used to as for an image in either GIF or
JPEG format - same resource, different representations. Or use the Accept
header to request XML .vs. HTML. Etc.

&gt; I had been under the impression that one of the goals of REST
&gt; was to make sure resources are uniquely identified by their URIs and not
&gt; via some RPC mechanism laundered through HTTP.
Responding with different variations of a representation are not introducing
extensible methods - no rpc here. Move along. These are not the droids
you're looking for.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There are no status codes that indicate that the body returned is
&gt; &gt; dependent on a cookie/auth.
&gt; &gt; There is the 'Vary' response header. This is used to indicate what
request

&gt;
&gt; http://my.bank/private/sj
&gt;
&gt; which asks for credentials (here, sj credentials)?

*sigh* sorry.  This is a mistake.  Originally, Steps 1 returned a web form
and Step 2 was a POST that created the URI.  I changed it to HTTP Auth to
avoid limiting the scope of the example to HTML.  I failed to re-read what I
changed it to, and therefore didn't catch that I was returning a 201 in
response to a GET.  So... let's go back and change that somewhat:

1) I POST my credentials to http://my.bank/access, be this from a web form,
some proprietary xml, etc.  The server authenticates me and returns a 201
with a Location of http://my.bank/access/12345.  (note: the html form could
be retrieved with a GET to http://my.bank/access.)

&gt; &gt; 7) Also on the screen is an option that says "send this page to:" and an
&gt; &gt; input box.  I fill in my accountant's e-mail address, and press
&gt; submit.
&gt;
&gt; What could be done here is first to POST to the URI:
&gt;
&gt; http://my.bank/accountant/sj
&gt;
&gt; an xml document containing the uri :
&gt;
&gt; http://my.bank/private/sj/accounts/checking/456
&gt;
&gt; This POST has for effect to make the corresponding resource available
&gt; as :
&gt;
&gt; http://my.bank/accountant/sj/accounts/checking/456
&gt;
&gt; I could then mail this uri to my accountant.
&gt;
&gt; If an authenticated user try to GET this, it has to be authenticated,
&gt; and if not the user sj himself, has to own the role "accountant".
&gt;
&gt; Of course, the role "private" does not give any right... .

I'm not sure I understand what you are saying here.  I get the bit about
creating the URI, but not the rest.

&gt; &gt; The e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit such as 30 minutes,
&gt; after
&gt; &gt; which, the link will only return a 404 response or some such.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; In my mind, this create a state inside the server (a timer). This is
&gt; bad isn't it ?

The timer is not part of the client state.  It's part of the resource state.
It's the client state that the server is not suppose to be maintaining.

By the way, the reason I created the URI instead of using HTTP Auth (or a
cookie or whatever) at all times was partly due to Tyler and his crazy
capabilities-based security model.  :)  I am not sure if I am doing it
right, but the basic idea here was that the bank issued a URI
(http://my.bank/access/12345) with a defined set of capabilities (the
"contract").  I could do anything that's defined, nothing more.  On top of
that, when I want to share part of my access, I ask the bank for another
capability URI (http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789) for that particular bit.
Like the first URI, use is limited to what is defined.  This also means that
I do not have to get my accountant set up with a separate password, flip a
potentially large set of switches to set the security context, etc. just to
give access.  Of course, this is a somewhat weak example, since most people
would likely just copy-n-paste the screen and e-mail it instead of go
through all of this effort.  But in a more complex situation, I see how this
approach could work well (I think).

I am the "OP" and I am surprised how my original question turned 
into this long conversation :-)

I was just asking how to solve a CGI programming problem with Python 
in a RESTful way!

I can not do HTTP authentication from a Python CGI script, can I?  I 
tried to look for examples or to figure it out but I have been 
unsuccessful.  And then somebody explained to me that HTTP auth. is 
not used by banks etc. on the internet, because it is not secure 
enough.  For my civilization like game HTTP auth. could be secure 
enough, but oh well, I don't know how to implement it from a CGI 
script anyway.
  
So I was thinking about setting up the "login" page with HTTPS and 
this then calls a CGI script generating a "sessionID" passed along 
with HIDDEN HTML FORM parameters on every next page, and then all 
the next pages don't need SSL.  The nice thing for me is then that I 
don't have to change source code when the SSL part is turned on 
later.  I can develop it using Apache on my laptop (without SSL).
Or is there a more RESTful way to do it?

Mark, I think identity without state is a canard.  If you substitute
"sameness"
for "identity", then sans state, there would be nothing to put to the test.

You seem to be arguing that if resource state is important, drag that into
court directly.  I was pointing out that there is a process for doing that,
and it
begins with identification of the thing to be dragged.  So the quality of
identifiers cannot be ignored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The relevant test here is, I believe, whether the state of the
resource
&gt; &gt; &gt; is relevant to the meaning of the message/data, or whether its
identity
&gt; &gt; &gt; is all that is relevant.  This is a key part of the "self-describing"
&gt; &gt; &gt; umbrella.  As an example, if you were a party to the court action,
then
&gt; &gt; &gt; your identity (via your name) on some document is likely relevant.
But
&gt; &gt; &gt; the colour of your hair probably wouldn't be (as an example of what
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be returned from GET on my URI).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In Paul's example there, if the state of the resource was important,
&gt; &gt; &gt; even if it was believed static, it should have been included in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; court documents by value rather than by reference.

Yeah, that tends to happen here.  :)

&gt; I was just asking how to solve a CGI programming problem with Python
&gt; in a RESTful way!
&gt;
&gt; I can not do HTTP authentication from a Python CGI script, can I?  I
&gt; tried to look for examples or to figure it out but I have been

&gt; enough.  For my civilization like game HTTP auth. could be secure
&gt; enough, but oh well, I don't know how to implement it from a CGI
&gt; script anyway.

Assuming that all banks use HTTPS, HTTP Auth no less secure than the use of
a session cookie.  The main reason that it's not used (I suspect) is that
the banks cannot control the look of the dialog box.  Another possbility is
that banks (wrongly) believe that HTTP Auth is less secure because it passes
plaintext user/pwd in every request.  But this is no less true of passing
the user/pwd from an HTML form.  The security is in the use of HTTPS.
Certainly, using HTTP Digest Auth (as opposed to Basic) would protect the
password, but the extra measure is pointless if using HTTPS.

One advantage to HTTP Auth (as opposed to an HTML form) is that you can
potentially access any resource in a collection directly instead of going to
a single "entrypoint".  As to whether you can handle HTTP Basic or Digest
Auth through Python CGI, I don't really know.  If you have access to all of
the HTTP request headers, then I'd think you should be able to manually
implement it.  Though it may be necessary to be running a SAPI module
instead of a CGI program...

&gt; So I was thinking about setting up the "login" page with HTTPS and
&gt; this then calls a CGI script generating a "sessionID" passed along
&gt; with HIDDEN HTML FORM parameters on every next page, and then all
&gt; the next pages don't need SSL.  The nice thing for me is then that I
&gt; don't have to change source code when the SSL part is turned on
&gt; later.  I can develop it using Apache on my laptop (without SSL).
&gt; Or is there a more RESTful way to do it?

This technique would be no better than using a session cookie, in my
opinion, and a whole lot more work (how would you handle GET requests?).
Placing the sessionID in the URL's query string would be another way to go.
Of course, there are a good number of opinions go around about what is the
right or wrong way of doing this and it is a far from settled topic.

As for the original topic, could you give a slightly more detailed example
who can and cannot access cities, what access is allowed in those cases, and
how you are currently doing it (or planning on doing it)?

You miss my point, sorry.
I wanted to say that your initial URI is just a "place
holder" for a modal interaction.
In fact, according to what you enter as a user id,
you will get different resources. 

I was suggesting
to directly enter a personalized URI containing 
you login name in it, like: 

http://my.bank/private/sj


&gt; &gt; &gt; 7) Also on the screen is an option that says
&gt; "send this page to:" and an
&gt; &gt; &gt; input box.  I fill in my accountant's e-mail

&gt; &gt; http://my.bank/private/sj/accounts/checking/456

&gt; &gt; http://my.bank/accountant/sj/accounts/checking/456

&gt; &gt;

&gt; to be authenticated,
&gt; &gt; and if not the user sj himself, has to own the
&gt; role "accountant".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course, the role "private" does not give any
&gt; right... .
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I understand what you are saying here. 
&gt; I get the bit about
&gt; creating the URI, but not the rest.
&gt; 
Well, I mean that I add a simple interaction before,
which simply add the resource you want to share in a
kind of shared folder which can only be seen by users
authenticated with the role "accountant". 

I suppose here that you accountant has this role. 

Of course both the operations can be made in one shot
by the server when you click on "send this page to".

In fact, what I propose here is to encode into URIs 
the owner of the resource (here "sj") along with a
"right"  (here "accountant") usable by non owners. 

I also proposed a simple way to share a personal
resource  (in POSTing to another place). 

&gt; &gt; &gt; The e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit
&gt; such as 30 minutes,
&gt; &gt; after
&gt; &gt; &gt; which, the link will only return a 404 response
&gt; or some such.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In my mind, this create a state inside the server
&gt; (a timer). This is
&gt; &gt; bad isn't it ?
&gt; 
&gt; The timer is not part of the client state.  It's
&gt; part of the resource state.
&gt; It's the client state that the server is not suppose
&gt; to be maintaining.
&gt; 
Yes, but such a timer is a dynamic, in memory
resource, which is very difficult to implement in a
scalable way. It suppose a kind of daemon attached to
the resource.

Imagine a farm of timers managing the state of hundred
such resources...

&gt; By the way, the reason I created the URI instead of
&gt; using HTTP Auth (or a
&gt; cookie or whatever) at all times was partly due to
&gt; Tyler and his crazy
&gt; capabilities-based security model.  :)  I am not
&gt; sure if I am doing it
&gt; right, but the basic idea here was that the bank
&gt; issued a URI
&gt; (http://my.bank/access/12345) with a defined set of
&gt; capabilities (the
&gt; "contract").  I could do anything that's defined,
&gt; nothing more.  On top of
&gt; that, when I want to share part of my access, I ask
&gt; the bank for another
&gt; capability URI (http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789)
&gt; for that particular bit.
&gt; Like the first URI, use is limited to what is
&gt; defined.  This also means that
&gt; I do not have to get my accountant set up with a
&gt; separate password, flip a
&gt; potentially large set of switches to set the
&gt; security context, etc. just to
&gt; give access.  

This is the point: what you want to do is to share
personalized resources without pain. 

However, your solution implies the generation of a
fake URI which has universal validity during its life
time. This is not really secure... 

Of course, this is a somewhat weak
&gt; example, since most people
&gt; would likely just copy-n-paste the screen and e-mail
&gt; it instead of go
&gt; through all of this effort.  But in a more complex
&gt; situation, I see how this
&gt; approach could work well (I think).
&gt; 

I aggree, this is not top notch security. Thats why
it is necessary to impose to the accountant to
authenticate himself before reading a shared URI. 

This also suppose an access control system providing 
roles (or capabilities). I suggested to encode them in
the URI, and to allocate to each registered users a
set of such roles, handled by the server. 

Encoding the "needed roles" in the URI allow a very
efficient check : the access control has simply to get
the available user roles from the authenticated user
profile, and then check that there is one which match
the "role part" of the presented URI. This trick avoid
to store a map resource-&gt;role in the server. 

My question was: is this acceptable ?

&gt; Yes, but such a timer is a dynamic, in memory
&gt; resource, which is very difficult to implement in a
&gt; scalable way. It suppose a kind of daemon attached to
&gt; the resource.
&gt;
&gt; Imagine a farm of timers managing the state of hundred
&gt; such resources...

I don't see why you need timers.  Store an expiration timestamp in the
resource.  On access the the URL, the timestamp is checked.  If expired,
return the appropriate 4xx response.  This method should scale fine.  Also,
caching would not be an issue because if SSL is being used, nothing is
cached anyhow.

&gt; &gt; By the way, the reason I created the URI instead of
&gt; &gt; using HTTP Auth (or a
&gt; &gt; cookie or whatever) at all times was partly due to
&gt; &gt; Tyler and his crazy
&gt; &gt; capabilities-based security model.  :)  I am not
&gt; &gt; sure if I am doing it
&gt; &gt; right, but the basic idea here was that the bank
&gt; &gt; issued a URI
&gt; &gt; (http://my.bank/access/12345) with a defined set of
&gt; &gt; capabilities (the
&gt; &gt; "contract").  I could do anything that's defined,
&gt; &gt; nothing more.  On top of
&gt; &gt; that, when I want to share part of my access, I ask
&gt; &gt; the bank for another
&gt; &gt; capability URI (http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789)
&gt; &gt; for that particular bit.
&gt; &gt; Like the first URI, use is limited to what is
&gt; &gt; defined.  This also means that
&gt; &gt; I do not have to get my accountant set up with a
&gt; &gt; separate password, flip a
&gt; &gt; potentially large set of switches to set the
&gt; &gt; security context, etc. just to
&gt; &gt; give access.
&gt;
&gt; This is the point: what you want to do is to share
&gt; personalized resources without pain.
&gt;
&gt; However, your solution implies the generation of a
&gt; fake URI which has universal validity during its life
&gt; time. This is not really secure...

First, the URI is not fake.  It is a fully functional, legitimate URI.
Second, I do not see why this method isn't secure.  It is every bit as
secure as any of the traditional methods (cookies, HTTP Basic Auth, etc).
The security is provided by the SSL, not the format of the URI.  About the
only thing I can think of is the possibility of someone looking over your
shoulder and writing down the URI.

&gt; Of course, this is a somewhat weak
&gt; &gt; example, since most people
&gt; &gt; would likely just copy-n-paste the screen and e-mail
&gt; &gt; it instead of go
&gt; &gt; through all of this effort.  But in a more complex
&gt; &gt; situation, I see how this
&gt; &gt; approach could work well (I think).
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I aggree, this is not top notch security. Thats why
&gt; it is necessary to impose to the accountant to
&gt; authenticate himself before reading a shared URI.

So would the mean that the accountant would have to get an access account
set up with my bank?  Somehow, I doubt that banks are going to want to take
the time to set up all of these accounts just so I can share views of my
transactions with my accountant, my lawyer, or the service rep on the other
end of the phone who refuses to believe that they overcharged me.  Not only
that, it means that my accountant would have to maintain accounts with all
of the banks, stock brokers, etc. that her clients use.  What a pain!  As
long at the generated URI is securely given to the intended recipient, I
don't see where the security issue is.  It would certainly be much easier
for my accountant to get a single encryption certificate with which I could
securely sender her an e-mail.

&gt; Encoding the "needed roles" in the URI allow a very
&gt; efficient check : the access control has simply to get
&gt; the available user roles from the authenticated user
&gt; profile, and then check that there is one which match
&gt; the "role part" of the presented URI. This trick avoid
&gt; to store a map resource-&gt;role in the server.

I will have to defer to Tyler on this one.  As I understand it, role-based
security is more prone to security holes than is capability-based security.
However, I come from the practice of a role-based model (good ol' MS
Windows) and am still learning the capability-based model, so my experience
is quite limited.

AND I am perfectly willing to admit that this whole thing could be very
unRESTful.  That's why I'm putting it out there ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; *sigh* sorry.  This is a mistake.  Originally, Steps

&gt; &gt; &gt; changed it to HTTP Auth to
&gt; &gt; &gt; avoid limiting the scope of the example to HTML.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; failed to re-read what I
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed it to, and therefore didn't catch that I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; returning a 201 in
&gt; &gt; &gt; response to a GET.  So... let's go back and change
&gt; &gt; &gt; that somewhat:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) I POST my credentials to http://my.bank/access,
&gt; &gt; &gt; be this from a web form,
&gt; &gt; &gt; some proprietary xml, etc.  The server authenticates
&gt; &gt; &gt; me and returns a 201
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a Location of http://my.bank/access/12345.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (note: the html form could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be retrieved with a GET to http://my.bank/access.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You miss my point, sorry.
&gt; &gt; I wanted to say that your initial URI is just a "place
&gt; &gt; holder" for a modal interaction.
&gt; &gt; In fact, according to what you enter as a user id,
&gt; &gt; you will get different resources.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was suggesting
&gt; &gt; to directly enter a personalized URI containing
&gt; &gt; you login name in it, like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://my.bank/private/sj
&gt; 
&gt; That's fine, if you are going to use something like HTTP Auth the entire
&gt; time.  My example was attempting to avoid use of HTTP Auth (except
for the
&gt; initial authentication).

Could you elaborate that ? you mean that you "hide" all uris of your 
sessions with generated keys inserted in each uri and only known by
which receive them ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as 30 minutes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which, the link will only return a 404 response
&gt; &gt; &gt; or some such.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind, this create a state inside the server
&gt; &gt; &gt; (a timer). This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad isn't it ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The timer is not part of the client state.  It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of the resource state.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's the client state that the server is not suppose
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be maintaining.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, but such a timer is a dynamic, in memory
&gt; &gt; resource, which is very difficult to implement in a

you are right. This suppose however additional data stored with each
resource and SSL used with all uris. This would be server SSL however.

Note that SSL is perhaps not 
the whole story. Data could be encrypted at the application level with
a key only known by the identified recipient. This would allow caching...

As far as I understand, it seems that encoding a "right" in the URI is
precisely which makes it a capability. You have in the same piece of
information (the URI) the address of the resource and the required
right to access it. My sharing example seems to be what capability
guys want: the ability to build dedicated handles on the same resource
without modifying it. Since it is Restful to have different URIs on
the same resource, it seems ok. 

What you do seems also to be a kind of capability based system in the
same aspect. My problem is that i dont like URIs with generated
numbers in them. What do experts think ? 

&gt; AND I am perfectly willing to admit that this whole thing could be very
&gt; unRESTful.  That's why I'm putting it out there ...

It's worth being precise about this. Http-auth only disallows access 
to representations. It doesn't disallow access to resources - the 
URI is already to hand and anyone can attempt to GET against it. 
Security-wise this is a similar approach to ACLs - a handle is 
issued for the resource in question before it's been established you 
have rights to interact with it.

I suspect ACL-style access management is not RESTful, but I don't 
have a compelling argument, just indigestion. Perhaps it's something 
to do with the security managers not being visible.

The issue here is whether resources parametrized by HTTP-auth or cookies 
are RESTful; whether e.g. two different bank accounts are different 
"representations" of the same underlying resource.  Here is what you said 
in your dissertation:
&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&gt;

"""
The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from 
other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between

In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints 
are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four 
interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of 
resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, 
hypermedia as the engine of application state. These constraints will be 
discussed in Section 5.2.

And in section 5.2 you say:

"""

MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, which are 
equivalent. The values in the set may be resource representations and/or

So, if my credit card company exposes 
&lt;https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary&gt;,
the content of which varies depending on a cookie, do you believe that 
response to a request for this URI is a representation of a REST style 
Resource?  In particular, do you believe that my account information and 
your account information are really different representations of the same 
underlying resource (that they are "equivalent") or that the resource 
identified by this URI is simply changing rapidly depending on which of us 
is making a request at that exact moment?

Alternatively, if my credit card company starts using HTTP-auth instead of 
cookie-auth, would that somehow make your account data and my account data 
different representations of the same underlying resource?

Note to Walden and the other folks on the legal-subpoena thread: We all 
have a pretty clear notion of what "my account" means.  That the content of 
my account changes over time (because I spend money or others steal it), 
doesn't change its identity (Herclitus/flux arguments notwithstanding). 
The issue here is simply whether or not the concept of "Representation" in 
Representational State Transfer is sufficiently broad so that a 
"Representation" is nothing more than the content return by an HTTP server 
at a specific moment in time.

&gt; of audit reference (you can't do that anyway -- you need all of the
&gt; information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,

&gt;
&gt; That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,

<pre>Alex,

Thanks for the note at the end.  I'm agreed that we all know what
"my account" means.  However, I'm not sure whether the crux of
the current matter is in the interpretation of "representation", or in
the interpretation of "identity".  I think it's the latter.

Intuitively, the "my account" identifier is dependent on an implicit
"me" identifier, which is dependent on some context or another in
order to provide a referent that could pass a reasonable "identity"
test.

Our society doesn't seem to accept "me" as an identifier in cases
where property or life is at stake, and I take my clues from that
observation.  Does it matter whether it's RESTful or not?

&gt; &gt; that specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form
&gt; &gt; of audit reference (you can't do that anyway -- you need all of the
&gt; &gt; information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,
&gt; &gt; method, authentication token, etc.).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,
&gt; &gt; conversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect
&gt; &gt; actions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are
&gt; &gt; trade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued
&gt; &gt; resource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more
&gt; &gt; specific resource before further actions take place, but both are
&gt; &gt; fully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be
&gt; &gt; vague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly
&gt; &gt; when a component has yet to determine the specific URI.

I have different preferences for the details, but the overall
approach fits my idea of RESTful access control.

By giving each user-specific resource its own URL, you bring your
access control policy into the REST model. Each permission has a
URL and can be manipulated like a normal resource. When relying on
usernames, individual permissions don't have a URL and thus can't
be manipulated, or even referred to, using the REST model. REST
needs URLs in order to function.

One of the things I like most about this type of solution is how
easy it is to model the solution using a web diagram. A web
diagram is just a diagram that uses circles to represent resources
and arrows to represent URLs. You could very easily go up to a
whiteboard and draw a web diagram for your http://my.bank/ example
application. You could use the web diagram to explain to someone
exactly what your application's security policy is and how it
works. You could then go to a web browser and show how your
implementation directly corresponds to the model drawn on the
whiteboard. I think this makes access control very tangible, easy
to undertand, and RESTful.

For an introduction to web diagrams, see:

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Suppose you have a URI like:

/client/xyz

where all paths beginning with 'client' require authentication and 'xyz'
could be any number of values.  When parsing the path, is it better to check
authentication as soon as you encounter 'client' or should you wait until
you have parsed the entire path and confirmed whether the path (and
therefore request URI) is valid or not?

If you authenticate first, it would be possible to request authentication
for a URI that's not even valid.  On the other hand, authenticating only
valid URIs would possibly allow a malicious user to "discover" valid URIs
without being authenticated.

Currently, I am implementing a system where I authenticate first, validate
the full path/URI second.  This greatly simplifies my code.  However, I am
curious to know if one approach is better than the other...

If a valid URI does not convey any authority (ie: the client must
be authenticated to use it), there is no need to worry about
"discovery" of valid URIs. From a security point of view, you
should assume that if your URIs are guessable, the attacker has
already guessed them.

Note that the type of URI you are proposing '/client/xyz' is
exactly the type of RESTless URI we were discussing in the
previous thread.

Actually, the example URI was a bit on the generic side to avoid discussions
of URI construction...  In the case of the application I'm working on,
there's a one-to-one relationship between the URI and the user (i.e. I don't
have multiple people logging in at the /client level).

Hmm, but from security point of view, you should not provide
functionality to verify that "guess". That is why you simply
get "login failed" instead of "invalid username" or "invalid
password" when you try to login UNIX system (at least, recent
ones). By returning 404 or 401, you're providing extra one bit
of information.

But since this is only a security restriction, I don't think
there's any REST constraint on this policy. It's up to the
implementor. If you think that bit of information is valuable
for RESTful interaction of the Web, then it should be free to
do so.

Some Unix systems do this in an attempt to protect users from
poorly chosen passwords. It's like saying: "Given that I know the
security is broken, what can I do to make things suck less?"
Limiting the login attempts does not make it infeasible for an
attacker to gain illegitimate access to the system.  Obviously
when designing a new system, the goal is to make a stronger
security model. The Unix login should not be your ideal. It has a
rather notorious history.

&gt; By returning 404 or 401, you're providing extra one bit
&gt; of information.

"Leaking bits" means that your security depends on an unguessable
identifier, but your implementation reveals some of the bits,
turning the unguessable identifier into a guessable identifier.
The attack on SSL that was recently in the press is an example of
"leaking bits".

Revealing a guessable URL is not leaking bits. Trying to hide
a guessable URL is just security through obfuscation.

Hi Seairth,

The new blog looks interesting; you have brought up two issues in
particular:

 * "in RNA, there is no defined GET operation on the Identity URI"

From a usability point of view it is definitely worth encouraging
implementations to return a meaningful response to GET for this URI.

 * "Some may observe that any such URL is more difficult to type in
   than a typical e-mail address"

True! Can't be helped though, without a cleverer URI resolution scheme
allowing URNs or something to be used instead.

Subject:REST &amp; User Interfaces<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

I'd like to learn about how REST principles have been and can be applied
to certain kinds of user interface cruft. I've just joined a company
that consciously applies REST to a back-end server interface, but the
front-end user interface is not very RESTy at all. I'm struggling to
imagine how certain features of that user interface, in common with user
interfaces I've seen in several Web applications, could be redesigned
consistent with REST principles.

These are some of the features I'm wondering about:

1. Login Page

The support for HTTP Basic authentication in common Web browsers is not
particularly user friendly. Therefore, Web applications that require
user authentication universally present an HTML login page with a form
that, when submitted, results in a cookie being set in the browser. This
cookie is often a session key, which is obviously not RESTful; on the
other hand, if the cookie were used purely as an authentication token
not requiring server state, would such use be consistent with REST?

2. Current User

Once the user is logged in, it is common to have at the very least the
user's name displayed in the corner of every page of the application. At
a further extreme, any given page may be completely different per user,
such as a user-customizable "dashboard". As I understand REST, the
representation returned from a GET should not depend on the
authorization state, but only on the URI.

What if instead of &lt;/dashboard&gt; the URI was &lt;/joe/dashboard&gt;? Any user
other than joe who tried to GET that resource could simply be forbidden.
But does that make sense for putting the user's name at the top of every
page of the application? Should every page view that a user can see be
considered a resource specific to that user?

3. Menus, Etc.

I wrote some comments and questions on this topic at the bottom of
&lt;http://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HowWikiComparesToRest&gt;. In that
discussion, it had been posited that a RESTful Wiki would use PUT for
editing pages. However, every page of a typical Wiki has a menu bar at
the top &amp; other bits of information like the last modified date at the
bottom, none of which can be edited by users.

More generally, Web applications tend to have lots of menus on the top
and left of every page that aren't directly relevant to the content of
the page, but are really window dressing for the entire site. How can
all that UI cruft be understood in a RESTful way?

<pre>I agree with your assessments.  Here are some short comments.
1. Cookies are an obviously better UI than HTTP-auth.  You just need to 
make sure you send a no-cache header if the request comes through a proxy. 
Otherwise users will get access to each other's cached pages.

2. Current user.  You should look at recent discussion we had on this topic 
(identification of resources).  You may want to make the URLs of the user 
pages unguessable.  Then users could opt to allow others to read them if 
they so chose (by sending a URL).  You then need to decide what these 
referred users are authorized to do.

3. Menus, etc.  You can use PUT.  Remember GET retrieves a representation 
of the resource.  If the PUT is text/plain and the GET has an accept: 
text/plain header, you could assume that the user wants the editable 
version of the page and not the rendered version.

Interesting, I wouldn't have thought of that. That really points out the
issue of security in general; if users really must not see each other's
pages, the server must require SSL, which prevents proxies along the way
anyway... But in this case, just specifying no-cache would at least
prevent
a proxy from *accidentally* sending one user's cached page to other
users.

&gt; pages unguessable. Then users could opt to allow others to read them
if
&gt; they so chose (by sending a URL). You then need to decide what these

Ah, I see now this has been a common topic. I had tried to search the

representation

&gt; text/plain header, you could assume that the user wants the editable
&gt; version of the page and not the rendered version.

But here's the question -- is the page with all that UI cruft
surrounding
the central content really just another "representation" of that
content? I
can easily accept the original Wiki text and its HTML rendering as two
representations of the same content resource, but the extra stuff put
around
it (menus, logos, search forms, last-modified notations, etc.) doesn't
feel
like part of the same resource.

Can that prohibition be more stated more specifically, to say that
cookie
authentication is not allowed in REST applications using HTTP as
currently
defined, simply because Cookie is a nonstandard header that proxies
ignore?

That is, assuming that I were to implement cookie authentication with
some
kind of secure token not requiring any server state, and Cookie was a
part
of the HTTP standard, and proxies were to treat Cookie similarly to how
they
treat Authorization for caching, would such use of cookies be consistent
with REST? It would be almost like having a Set-Authorization response
header that could be returned from posting a login form, giving the
credentials that should be returned by the client on subsequent
requests.
Does that make any sense?

Hmm, I think that a URI containing a session key, like Java's

probably isn't RESTful. It's just a hack to pass around a handle
for application state on the server and an abuse of the URI

Maybe the protocol &amp; existing software (user-agents &amp; servers) do not
satisfy the use case most web site authors have in mind. The
'Set-Authorization' response header suggested leads into what the real
desire from the community is - authentication tokens originating at the
server.

I would recommend treating your UI components as the resources rather 
than treating them as just another representation of the content. I say 
this in part because browsers dont support PUT or DELETE, but also 
because you end up jumping through hoops for anything more than the 
simplest of UIs.

For example (off the top of my head), a user management system might 
have as resources /app/usercreator (a create screen), 
/app/usereditor?uid=x (an edit screen), and /app/userviewer?uid=x (a 
view screen).  The resource is then the UI component.  You can still 
make users first-class resources (give the URIs) - but you would still 
pass the URI in to the UI component resource 
(/app/usereditor?user=/app/users/foo).

With all due respect, given that HTTP authentication is fundamentally 
broken*, that cookies are a defacto standard, and that HTTP-auth is poorly 
supported by actual UAs.  The bigger question is why duplicate cookie 
functionality with auth-specific headers?

The argument for HTTP-auth is that it provides an automated mechanism for a 
web server to tell a web client that authentication information is required 
and specifies the type.

When end-users are accessing a web site, auth is a user interface issue and 
not automatic so there is no reason why auth requirements cannot be 
specified in the body of a 401 response.

When auth-access is automated, are there actual contexts in which automated 
clients try to access get a 401 and then try some auth protocol?  In 
reality don't they simply request with the correct auth and if that's what 
they do, isn't that simply passing a cookie?

-Alex-

* HTTP-auth is broken because nothing binds the auth to the content of the 
request, so there is no protection from MITM attacks.  You can solve this 
with SSL, but that is not part of the HTTP spec and is unfortunately 
overkill for many applications.

Subject:Case Study (was Re: REST &amp; User Interfaces)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Okay... here's a test case I am currently working on (RNA).  Tell me if this
looks good or not:

Key:
    {id} would be something like "seairth" or "bob" or "cmhinson" or
whatever.
    {abc} is currently a 32-hex character representation of a random 16-byte
number.
    {uri} is a URL-Encoded URI to be used in a query string
    "Auth-" indicates these methods require HTTP Authentication.
    note: almost all of the names are changable (at least until there are
        resources bound to them).

/{id}
    POST agreements, GET user-defined page (likely HTML)
/{id}/inbox/{abc}
    POST notifications (e.g. send {id} a notification)
/{id}/notifications/{abc}
    GET notificaction (e.g. notification sent to others)


/{id}/access
    Auth-GET returns the list of URIs to access the following resources
    (e.g. /{id}/received, /{id}/agreements, etc.)
/{id}/notifications
    Auth-GET returns the list of notifications user has created
    Auth-POST to create a new notification.
/{id}/received
    Auth-GET returns list of URIs to received notifications
/{id}/received/{abc}
    Auth-GET returns a received notification
    Auth-DELETE deletes a received notification
/{id}/agreements
    Auth-GET returns list of URIs to existing agreements
    Auth-POST to create a new agreement returns agreement URI
/{id}/agreements/{abc}
    Auth-GET returns an agreement
    Auth-PUT updates an agreement
    Auth-DELETE deletes an agreement
/{id}/sent
    Auth-GET returns a list of individuals sent notifications
    Auth-POST to send a notification (after creating the notification)
/{id}/sent/{abc}
    Auth-GET returns "record" on the sending of a notification to an
individual
    Auth-PUT updates the "record"
    Auth-DELETE deletes the "record"
/{id}/settings
    Auth-GET returns settings
    Auth-PUT updates settings

The above URIs are broken into two groups.  The first group of URIs are
those that are accessible by anyone (as long as they know the actual URI),
and are defined by the RNA spec.  The second group of URIs are those that
are accessible only to the "owner" of {id}.  Only XML documents are passed,
containing only data (no presentation).  This group of URIs would likely be
accessed by a client program and not directly by a user.

Now, I am also trying to write a web-based (html) client to demonstrate the
application.  Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or less
mapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,
since I needed additional things like edit windows and

/client?uri={uri}
    Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation
    {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The
    "/{id}/access" URI would be the "main" URI, which would return
    the entry page, main menu, etc.
/client/addform?uri={uri}
    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form
    Auth-POST submits the form
    {uri} must be one of the "container" URIs (e.g. "/{id}/agreements")
    mentioned above that accepts POST (client internally POSTs XML to the
    target {uri}).
/client/editform?ur={uri}
    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form
    Auth-POST submits the form
    {uri} must be one of the individual resource URIs (e.g.
    "/{id}/agreements/{abc}") mentioned above that accepts PUT (client
    internally updates using PUT to the target {uri}).
/client/delete?uri={uri}
    Auth-POST submits form
    {uri} must be a parent URI of the URI that will be deleted (which is
    passed in the form itself).  Response returns the equivalent of
    "GET /client?{uri}" (minus the deleted resource).

In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value
of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:

    GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}
        returns the main menu options
    GET /client?uri={/{id}/settings}
        returns a static view of the current settings.
    GET /client/editform?uri={/{id}/settings}
        returns a form for editing changes.
    GET /client?uri={/{id}/agreements}
        returns a static list of the agreements.
    GET /client/addform?uri={/{id}/agreements}
        returns form to add an agreement.
    etc.

Otherwise, the client is designed to work with any implementation that uses
the XML documents associated to the second group of URIs above.  As a
result, it would be possible to use the same client to access entirely
different servers as long as the XML interface stayed the same.  Of course,
this is all conceptual now, so I am sure there are some details that I have
overlooked which may make some or all of this approach difficult to do.

But, as a general pattern, what does everyone think?

<pre>cookie-based and HTTP auth are identical when the
client is software.  The only difference is the
name of the HTTP header in which the
authentication token is passed.  But really the
whole premise of HTTP auth is unreasonable for
automated clients.  Clients just send a secret
token.  They don't need a mnemonic separating
usernames from passwords.

For human users, the login form that comes in the
401 response is as visible as you want.  In
practice Mozilla appears to auto-fill most login
forms I reach correctly and without issue which
makes me think that visibility is a non-issue.

I hand't originally planned on it, but such a form could have it's
advantages (like deleting multiple resources at a time)  On the other hand,
it might also be possible to drop the whole /delete bit and add a POST
/client?uri={uri} that could handle the delete.  This second approach would
likely be cleaner anyhow...

Except in my examples above, which I don't think I have made very clear
(sorry) is that {/{id}/access} would actually be something like
"http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/access" (notice the last part of the
path).  As a result, above examples would look more like:

GET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/access
GET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/settings
GET /client/editform?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/settings
GET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/agreements
GET /client/addform?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/agreements

This would also allow the client's host server to be independent, meaning  I
could access an RNA interface on http://example.invalid from
http://www.sample.invalid.  Now, I suppose you could have something like:

GET /client/menu?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/
GET /client/settingsviewer?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/
GET /client/settingseditor?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/
GET /client/agreementsviewer?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/
GET /client/agreementscreator?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/

However, what would the URI be when you wanted to work with a specific
agreement?

<pre>I originally posted this question to www-talk@... a couple days ago. 
Maybe someone here has some thoughts?

I'm working on a system that has a REST interface used to exchange, 
among other things, configuration documents.

The interface used to be a CGI, for many reasons I wrote a bare bones 
HTTP server, I can now attempt to make the interface more RESTful.

Specifically, the CGI environment doesn't let me deal with ETags and 
preconditions (If-Match, If-None-Match), so the configuration documents 
in my system contain a sort of CRC of the document, to solve the 
concurrent update problem (CRC in submitted document doesn't match 
stored version = reject).

With my web server I'm planning on using ETags and preconditions, as 
outlined in:

http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/

I think I have the mechanics clear, the client GETs a document, 
modifies the document, PUTs it back with an If-Match with the original 
ETag. The server rejects the PUT unless the string supplied through 
If-Match actually matches.

I have been recently bitten by Squid downgrading a request to HTTP/1.0, 
in a bug in my code I would respect the "Expect: 100-continue" header 
even though the incoming request was HTTP/1.0 and emit a 100, which 
Squid apparently doesn't really know what to do with, confusing the 
original client.

Now, if my configuration document update process requires and relies on 
HTTP/1.1 features like If-Match, what should I do with proxies like 
Squid that downgrade the connection to HTTP/1.0?

Squid would probably leave the If-Match header in place, as it left the 
Expect header. Can I rely on this to use the If-Match anyway and 
simulate the precondition failure through a generic 400 after the PUT 
(instead of a PUT-aborting 412)? Or will some HTTP/1.0 proxy 
resynthetize the headers and drop the unknown ones, thus breaking an 
HTTP/1.1-specific application?

Thanks,
Duncan

&gt; Now, I am also trying to write a web-based (html) client to demonstrate
the
&gt; application.  Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or
less
&gt; mapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,
&gt; since I needed additional things like edit windows and
&gt;
&gt; /client?uri={uri}
&gt;     Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation
&gt;     {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The
&gt;     "/{id}/access" URI would be the "main" URI, which would return
&gt;     the entry page, main menu, etc.
[snip]
&gt; In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value
&gt; of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:
&gt;
&gt;     GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}
&gt;         returns the main menu options
[snip]

Well, it occurs to me that there are a few  design problems here...

First, suppose I had an RNA address of http://example.com/rna/seairth and
the client software was at http://example.com/rnaclient.  According to the
above stuff, the 'entry-point' would be:

http://example.com/rnaclient?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/access

Frankly, this isn't very user-friendly.  First, the URL is way to long to
have to type in.  Second, it requires me to know/remember the URI of my
"access" resource.  So what would be some solutions?  So far, I have thought
of the following (along with their limitations):

1) The client could have a "default" URI, but this would only be useful
where a particular copy of the client was being used by one person only.

2) Instead, one could use just the RNA Address
(http://example.com/rna/seairth) and the client would auto-append the
"access" bit.  If the server returned a 404, it could then try other
possibilities, effectively hunting for the interface.  This solution is not
very flexible, since all it would take is a particular inplementation to
change the path slightly (e.g. "client-access") in order for the client to
fail discovery.

3) If no uri is given, show a simple form requesting the appropriate access
URI.  Once given, store as a cookie to auto-fill the textbox in future.
Problems: not portable, still requires knowledge of access URI, etc.

4) Double up the access URI and the RNA address.  Since the only purpose of
the access URI is to return an xml document, it would be possible to use
conneg on a GET of the RNA Address.  This way, a user would only have to
know their own RNA Address (which they would anyhow).  This could be coupled
with #3 above, where the coookie bit would only be a convenience.  The down
side is that I'm not too crazy about overloading the RNA Address like this
(purely from a technical POV; I think end-users would be oblivious and
therefore fine with it).

5) Move the client to be under the RNA Address, effectively replacing the
"access URI".  Through conneg, it would still be possible to return the
original XML document from the client URI so that "thick" clients could
still have access.  The main advantage here is that the URI would be
memorable (e.g. http://example.com/rna/seairth/client).  However, it seems
somewhat like overkill to pass entire URIs in the query string, esp. since
it would be unlikely that you would use the client to access any RNA address
other than the one it was under.  On the other hand, I could be wrong here.
For instance, this would allow one to customize the look-and-feel of the
client program, then access other RNA Addresses while continuing to keep
that look-and-feel.  When accessing another site, you would have to use
something akin to the original syntax (e.g.
http://example.com/rna/seairth/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob), but
it's probably fine at that point.



The other problem is that the current approach would require a GET of the
"access URI" resource for every request in order to determine what the
actual uri parameter is pointing to.  For instance, in order to understand
the following:

    GET /client/addform?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements

I would have to first do a GET on the "access URI".  Now, given the above
URI, the access URI isn't known (unless using solution #4 above).  It seems
to me that there are two possible approaches (other than #4):

1) To change the structure so that everything pointed to by the access URI
was under the access URI (e.g. /{id}/access/agreements,
/{id}/access/settings, etc.), which doesn't seem to be a very good solution.
While it may give access to the "access URI" (in a not-so-opaque manner), it
still means that an additional GET is required to understand the bits
underneath it.

2) To go Chuck's way, sort of.  He suggested:

&gt;    GET /client/menu?id={id}
&gt;    GET /client/settingsviewer?id={id}
&gt;    GET /client/settingseditor?id={id}
&gt;    GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={id}
&gt;    GET /client/agreementscreator?id={id}

Where I took {id} as I meant it in the original post ( "something like
'seairth' or 'bob' or 'cmhinson'"). Instead, they could be:

    GET /client/menu?id={uri}
    GET /client/settingsviewer?id={uri}
    GET /client/settingseditor?id={uri}
    GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={uri}
    GET /client/agreementscreator?id={uri}

In other words, when you get back the initial "access URI" list, they are
translated into meaningful (to the client) URIs that would no longer require
additional accesses to the "access URI" list.  For instance, a request gets
back the list of agreements:

    http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123
    http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456

This would be translated into client-specific URIs looking something like:


http://example.com/rnaclient/agreementviewer?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123

http://example.com/rnaclient/agreementeditor?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123


http://example.com/rnaclient/agreementviewer?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456

http://example.com/rnaclient/agreementeditor?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456

The uri is still intact (and totally opaque) and the client program still
implicitly knows what the resource at the other end of the URI is (though it
should probably validate anyhow).


So, for the second problem, I'd be likely to go with option #2.  For the
first problem, I am leanding towards #5, but am unsure.  Any thoughts?

I would think that while cookies may be a defacto standard, cookie-based

&gt;"access" resource.  
&gt;

I'm not sure I would worry too much about the URI being too long.  No 
matter what the length, the user will probably just bookmark it anyway.

If your client software has the same host as your RNA address and your 
access URIs are always the same except for the id part (seairth above), 
then I could easily see where you have a default page at 
http://example.com/rnaclient that asks you for your id (seairth in this 
case) and then fowards/redirects you to the appropriate page using the 
URI above.  Once there, the user shouldn't have to type any URIs - he 
should be able to click his way anywhere else he needs to go.  And given 
one URI, the server should be able to generate content containing 
appropriately formed URIs for that user.


&gt;So what would be some solutions?  So far, I have thought
&gt;of the following (along with their limitations):
&gt;
&gt;1) The client could have a "default" URI, but this would only be useful
&gt;where a particular copy of the client was being used by one person only.
&gt;

This isnt a whole lot different than the way mail clients work right 
now.  Each user has a separate copy of the client configured with their 
mail server info.

&gt;
&gt;2) Instead, one could use just the RNA Address
&gt;(http://example.com/rna/seairth) and the client would auto-append the
&gt;"access" bit.  If the server returned a 404, it could then try other
&gt;possibilities, effectively hunting for the interface.  This solution is not
&gt;very flexible, since all it would take is a particular inplementation to
&gt;change the path slightly (e.g. "client-access") in order for the client to
&gt;fail discovery.
&gt;

Why bother with the hunting part?  For the sake of interop, just require 
that the access page is the rna address with /access appended. Once 
enough implementations do it that way, any implementation that does it 
differently will be considered broken.

&gt;
&gt;3) If no uri is given, show a simple form requesting the appropriate access
&gt;URI.  Once given, store as a cookie to auto-fill the textbox in future.
&gt;Problems: not portable, still requires knowledge of access URI, etc.
&gt;

Uggh.  Plenty of other options.  Let's drop this one.

&gt;4) Double up the access URI and the RNA address.  Since the only purpose of
&gt;the access URI is to return an xml document, it would be possible to use
&gt;conneg on a GET of the RNA Address.  This way, a user would only have to

&gt;

What's the hangup.  Actually, the only problems I can think of are 
semantic, not technical - in one case the URI identifies a user, in the 
other, the URI identifies the user's access page.  Given recent 
discussion on the TAG list, this might not be the 'purest' way to do 
things, but it sure seems practical.

&gt;
&gt;5) Move the client to be under the RNA Address, effectively replacing the
&gt;"access URI".  Through conneg, it would still be possible to return the

&gt;

Why not http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob 
when you're on a different server?

Why does bob need to know about seairth (or seairth's rna address)?

I think any of the above would probably work out just fine (although I 
really dont like 3).

Hmmm.  I thought visibility was about the ability of 
components/intermediaries to understand the meaning of the message.  
I.e., a proxy can't tell whether or not a cookie contains auth info 
since it doesnt know the syntax of what's been packed in the cookie.  
However, it does know what the HTTP auth header means, and thus knows 
what it can or cant do with the message (and its response).  (This all 
may be moot as far as auth headers and cookies go since I think many 
proxies wont cache things with cookies in them).

To my knowledge, it's bad form to "force" a specific URI naming convention.

I agree.  One could probably restate it so that it sounded kosher, but it

&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why not http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob
&gt; when you're on a different server?
&gt;
&gt; Why does bob need to know about seairth (or seairth's rna address)?

Normally, bob wouldn't need to know about seairth's RNA address.  bob would
likely access http://example.com/rna/bob/client.  However, I have multiple
identities: personal, work, etc.  In each of those cases, I may have a
separate RNA Address.  I may have full control over my personal address and
client, and therefore may customize it in various ways.  When accessing my
work address, I *could* use the client at that address, but I could also use
the client at my personal address which has my personal customizations.

But this does bring up another interesting issue.  It would be possible to
use any web client to access any RNA Address.  As a result, I could use your
client to access my address.  Now, I don't know *why* I would want to do
such a thing, esp. since I would be giving you the oportunity to discover my
auth-info.  But it is possible.  Of course, it would also be possible to
just disable the feature that would allow such a thing.  For most people,
this would likely be the prefered setting.  Another possbility to would be
to require independent authentication for use of the client.  In most cases,
the authentication info would be the same as for the associated RNA Address
itself.  However, in the case where a second address is accessed (e.g.
work), it would probably be necessary to maintain a separate profile with
separate authentication information so that the client could properly access
the remote RNA Address.  This way, only addresses specified in profiles
would be accessible.

And a final thought (for now)...  If one really wanted to set up a server to
use a format like

&gt; http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob

This could be done with a redirection.  All bob would have to remember is
http://example.com/rna/bob/client.  Upon typing that in, he would be
redirected to the extended version.  This makes it easy for him to remember
while still allowing flexibility in the way that the client is implemented.

&gt; I think any of the above would probably work out just fine (although I
&gt; really dont like 3).

The more I think about it, the more #5 seems like the way to go.

<pre>The only thing that a proxy decides based on the content of the auth 
headers is caching and if you do cookie-auth you just do more explicit 
cache-control.  And if you are doing auth-related stuff, you should be 
doing more explicit cache control anyway so I don't see the value that 
special purpose auth headers provide.

&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hmmm.  I thought visibility was about the ability of
&gt; components/intermediaries to understand the meaning of the message.
&gt; I.e., a proxy can't tell whether or not a cookie contains auth info
&gt; since it doesnt know the syntax of what's been packed in the cookie.
&gt; However, it does know what the HTTP auth header means, and thus knows
&gt; what it can or cant do with the message (and its response).  (This all
&gt; may be moot as far as auth headers and cookies go since I think many
&gt; proxies wont cache things with cookies in them).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You should note that there is no design reason why Authorization
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and WWW-Authenticate are limited to Basic and Digest.  That is why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality in another field?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With all due respect, given that HTTP authentication is fundamentally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; broken*, that cookies are a defacto standard, and that HTTP-auth is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poorly supported by actual UAs.  The bigger question is why duplicate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie functionality with auth-specific headers?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would think that while cookies may be a defacto standard, cookie-based
&gt;&gt;&gt; authentication is not (i.e., there is no standard implementation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; authentication using cookies).  Thus, it would seem to me that
&gt;&gt;&gt; visibility still suffers.

Subject:Pure-REST Wiki experiment<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Trying to reconcile some of the ideas I've been reading here,
last night I threw together the beginnings of a pure-REST Wiki.
The client and server are both included at the end of this
message.

The resources are Wiki topics, with URIs like &lt;/wiki/HomePage&gt;,
with GET returning the Wiki-text representation of a topic, PUT
supplying a new Wiki-text representation to create or modify a
topic, and DELETE deleting a topic. POST is not accepted for any
resource in this application. This is all implemented by a single
Java servlet.

The user interface is implemented completely on the client side
using HTML and JavaScript. It uses the XmlHttpRequest object to
make requests to the server. User interaction is done through
form elements, but the form never gets submitted anywhere; it's
just accessed by the JavaScript. The GET, PUT, and DELETE
commands are shown as buttons, and the name of the current topic
is shown in an editable text field. All the commands construct
the URI from the topic name. GET displays the Wiki-text of the
topic in a large textarea; and PUT transfers the contents of that
textarea back to the server, allowing editing of a topic
retrieved by GET. PUT and DELETE both clear the contents of that
textarea. The status code of each response is displayed in a
small non-editable text field.

What I really had in mind was to implement the HTML rendering of
the Wiki text in the JavaScript client as well, including links
between topics as JavaScript onClick handlers, but I didn't get
that far yet.

Some issues:

1. IE caches the GET responses, which is kind of cool. However,
it doesn't invalidate the cache after a PUT or DELETE! So doing a
GET, editing the text, doing a PUT, and then doing a GET again
gives the original text. I had to turn off caching in IE while
playing with it; I guess the GET responses could carry a no-cache
directive instead...

2. At first I returned 204 from PUT if the resource already
existed (201 otherwise), but it seemed that the JavaScript send()
call was never returning. Simply changing it to 205 avoided this
problem.

3. As it is, the user interface is really a browser-in-the-
browser. It has its own location bar, and manages navigation
among Wiki topics entirely within one browser "page".  That
implies a couple of problems -- for one, the browser's history
buttons don't work.

4. Every topic has a URI, but if that URI is typed directly in
the browser, the user will be able to view the Wiki-text
representation of the topic, but won't see any of the UI.

Altogether a successful experiment, demonstrating how to deploy a
potentially-fancy JavaScript-driven UI for a pure-REST
application. I wonder how to resolve the 4 issues above...

Any reactions?

at first i wondered why not use conneg (perhaps based on the user agent

rather than a 'browser-within-a-browser' approach.  as in, the editor 
GETs
wiki-text, and everything else GETs HTML.

i would like to create a RESTful wiki one day as well, real life 
permitting.
FWIW i would model the resources as:

/topic/ : GET gets HTML.
/topic/form/ : GET gets a HTML form with a target of ".." and the 
wikitext
loaded in to a textarea.  the submit method would be POST, even though
semantically i think PUT would be more appropriate here.

i would also like a resource /topic/revisions/ which gives an
annotated-diff revision history of the topic, like viewcvs.

it's always nice to see another real-world RESTful application; kudos on
a nice piece of work.

<pre>Very cool.  Its too bad it works only in IE.

Rather than implementing rending in javascript, you could use conneg on the 
server to differentiate between retrieving rendered pages and the source. A 
GET with a "accept: text/plain" would retrieve the source.  A GET with an 
"accept: text/html" would retrieve the rendered page.

Question for the group: Suppose that the wiki also rendered into ASCII.  Is 
there some convention for retrieving the source rather than the output 
beyond a slight hack involving coercing them to have different 
content-types?

&gt;
&gt; 2. At first I returned 204 from PUT if the resource already
&gt; existed (201 otherwise), but it seemed that the JavaScript send()
&gt; call was never returning. Simply changing it to 205 avoided this
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; 3. As it is, the user interface is really a browser-in-the-
&gt; browser. It has its own location bar, and manages navigation
&gt; among Wiki topics entirely within one browser "page".  That
&gt; implies a couple of problems -- for one, the browser's history
&gt; buttons don't work.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Every topic has a URI, but if that URI is typed directly in
&gt; the browser, the user will be able to view the Wiki-text
&gt; representation of the topic, but won't see any of the UI.
&gt;
&gt; Altogether a successful experiment, demonstrating how to deploy a
&gt; potentially-fancy JavaScript-driven UI for a pure-REST
&gt; application. I wonder how to resolve the 4 issues above...
&gt;
&gt; Any reactions?

Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Pure-REST Wiki experiment


&gt; Question for the group: Suppose that the wiki also rendered into ASCII.
Is
&gt; there some convention for retrieving the source rather than the output
&gt; beyond a slight hack involving coercing them to have different
&gt; content-types?

Slightly different URI?  For instance, given a folder in my blog system, you
can return different formats as follows:

http://www.seairth.com/blog?rss=0.91
http://www.seairth.com/blog?rss=0.92
http://www.seairth.com/blog?rss=0.93
http://www.seairth.com/blog?rss=2.0

Using a content-type of "text/xml" would not be enough.  In the wiki, maybe
you could add a global "type" URL parameter so that you could do something
like:

http://example.com/wiki/HomePage?type=editable

Thanks. Netscape does also implement an XmlHttpRequest object with the

&gt; However, is this the correct terminology for RESTful interfaces (as
&gt; implemented with HTTP)?  Somehow, "API" doesn't seem right.  I would think
&gt; something like

An API provides an interface without which the code/library/service cannot 
be used. However a RESTful interface uses hypertext as the engine of 
application state (so the set of possible transitions is documented in the 
instance data, not in some external interface definition) with a small set 
of known verbs. So it seems to me that no such term is necessary, aside 
from "RESTful interface" (RI?).

&gt; at first i wondered why not use conneg (perhaps based on the
&gt; user agent (UA)) rather than a 'browser-within-a-browser'
&gt; approach. as in, the editor GETs wiki-text, and everything else
&gt; GETs HTML.

I have a feeling what I really want is to convince the browser
that my client.html is actually a plugin appropriate for
text/x-wiki content. So, whenever the user types in a URI that
dereferences to a representation of type text/x-wiki, the
response would simply be passed off to this JavaScript client.
The client would still have its own buttons for Edit and Delete,
sending PUT and DELETE requests, respectively; but links to other
Wiki topics or to non-Wiki URIs would be handed back to the
browser.

But the document schemas are a prerequisite. Even with GET, the
programmer needs to know how to interpret the returned document.
The HTML spec has to exist for the WWW to work.

W3 specs of this kind seem to be called "languages".  Perhaps the
replacement for API is AL (Application Language).

Subject:MoST - Model State Transfer (was Pure-REST Wiki experiment)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Note: Draft musings.  Please be gentle.

Model State Transfer is an emerging web architecture style in which agents 
transfer application data models themselves occasionally packaged with 
metadata describing how the model should be viewed and constraining how it 
may be altered (e.g. HTML/XML with css/xsl stylesheets and schemas).  In 
contrast Representational State Transfer, is an older style in which agents 
transfer representations of application referents (e.g. HTTP with conneg 
and content-type).

REST pretends that we can talk about transferring representations without 
talking about being able to talk unambiguously about what is represented. 
This pretense is surprisingly effective in publishing information hidden in 
databases.  It runs into serious trouble however when we want to shift from 
publishing apps to two-way apps.  Examples include the difficulty in 
describing how to implement a Wiki, the meaninglessness of "index" and HTTP 
containers, the failure of conneg, the uselessness of PUT (and WebDAV 
almost everywhere), and the lack of a coherent story about POST.

No ReSTful general Wikis or web editting (or the uselessness of PUT)
ReSTful clients lack a model for the data they receive and therefore can do 
little other than render it.  The uselessness of PUT is an obvious 
consequence of this failure.   PUT only works in the small set of apps 
where the returned data happens to correspond to the underlying model or 
when changes in the representation are invertible.  Those apps are actually 
relatively rare.  Wiki and database apps both fall outside that category. 
Of course, one CAN design apps to make sure that this constraint is 
followed, but then you are no longer passing around representations, you 
are passing around data models themselves.
The upshot of ReSTs failure here is that we are actually spending any time 
at all implementing Wikis as opposed to WebDAV and that none of this work 
is useful for editing user-friendly directories.  In contrast, MoST 
architectural style would give the client the underlying data so that 
File|Edit would have the browser open an editor appropriate to the data 
content-type.  For example, in a addressbook application, the server would 
send XML V-Cards with a stylesheet URL in the XML header that transforms 
those v-cards into user-friendly SVG.  The client would apply the 
transformation and render the SVG using an SVG viewer.   If the user chose 
File|Edit from the browser menu, the browser would open up an editor 
designed to handle v-cards (outlook? if installed) or perhaps simply an XML 
editor.  And when the user "saves" the changes, they are simply PUT back to 
the server.


Containers
Another example of the failure of the ReST model is uselessness of the 
container metaphor.  The most obvious operation to perform on a container 
is to obtain an enumeration of its contents.  ReST provides no standard way 
to do that.  Instead servers are intended to return a "respresentation" of 
the container. In practice this representation is so far from representing 
the container that a foo/ URL is really just a URL like any other with no 
particularly interesting special properties.  Under MoST GETting a foo/ URL 
would actually result in a model of the container.  This model may be 
packaged with a view URL/transformation, but containership would actually 
have real meaning.

Content-Negotiation
Content-negotiation exacerbates the problem above.  It is particularly 
incompatible with PUT/POST because the server has no way to tell the client 
what types may be PUT/POST and REST provides no way to understand what was 
meant when a client does so.  MoST applications  give each URL a specific 
content-type/data-model.  MoST clients and servers know that they are 
communicating about that data model.  Under MoST it is meaningful to update 
content from a PUT.  In real life, conneg is used much less often than 
simply proliferating URLs.  MoST endorses that approach, viewing e.g. 
language translations as different objects and not simply different 
representations.

What is a POST?
In theory a POST is intended to update the server about some refferent.  In 
practice usage of POST also ends up being application specific.  There is 
no way to know what one may POST to a particular URL without having access 
to some special purpose meta-data located at some arbitrarily different URL 
(the location of e.g. an HTTP form).  ReST also provides no way of knowing 
what the consequence of a POST is, other than, abstractly, some state 
change, perhaps.  In contrast, a MoST POST has some semantic coherence.  It 
is an append to a container (because we now have containers) or it is an 
update to particular data model based on the semantics of updates to models 
of that type.  Note: Unlike ReST POSTs, MoST POSTs are NOT database queries 
unless they create new resources that are result-sets.

Queries
ReST has no interpretation of query strings either.  They are opaque and 
invisible.  MoST constrains query strings to be filters on the set of 
objects returns by a container (because it actually has access to models it 
can do this).  Query-strings on non-container objects are not-meaninful.

Container Creation
MKDIR is a silly semantic.  Simply PUT a container data model at a URL 
where you want the container to be.  Then you have a container.  If the 
server doesn't understand the semantics of the container data model the 
client puts, it gives an error.

HTTP support for MoST architectural style is relatively weak.  Content-type 
ends up being used both to constrain viewing and editing.  XML with schemas 
and stylesheets better supports MoST.   It would be nice to be able to do 
MoST with other content-types.  Perhaps HTTP will eventually have a 
content-view or model-location header.

Note: MoST isn't a PhD thesis.  It is just my description of a different 
design philosophy
that I see around.  Hoping for useful comments.

Justin is effectively describing a MoST wiki implementation rather than a 
ReST implementation below.

My point is that ReST views the returned content as a representation of the 
refferent of a URL.  So, in ReST, a V-Card or an MP3 is only a 
representation of a business card or a song not the business-card or song 
itself.  We've known since Plato that there is no unmediated access to any 
real-world thing so this representational view guarantees vagueness.

I am suggesting that we concentrate all the representational vagueness in 
the construction of the data model and then focus our Internet applications 
only on manipulating particular data models -- which is much less vague.

In other words, I am suggesting that clients and servers have a shared data 
model (content-type) and not just a shared referent (URI).

&gt;     Alex&gt; Content-Negotiation Content-negotiation exacerbates the
&gt;     Alex&gt; problem above.  It is particularly incompatible with
&gt;     Alex&gt; PUT/POST because the server has no way to tell the client

I'm not sure what you mean

&gt; A server can always accepts content types it understands and issue a
&gt; 4xx when it doesn't of course.

On some level, my point is that machines don't understand content-types 
PERIOD; they only manipulate them according to some set of predefined 
rules.  My issue with ReST is that it provides no rules for manipulating 
them other than the application specific rules divined by the server 
operator and hidden from the world.

If the data model of the server is hidden, then the effect of a PUT is 
completely unpredictable.  If a client GETs foo.gif and then PUTs bar.gif, 
exactly what should be the expected behavior?  Should the server delete the 
foo.gif and replace it with the bar.gif?  If the foo.gif is a picture of a 
person wearing a blue shirt and bar.gif a person wearing a green shirt, 
should the server simply update a database entry about the color of a 
shirt?  Without the underlying data model, we have no way to understand the 
effect of any change operation without a lot of application/server specific 
local knowledge.

In contrast, if a MoST client GETs a foo.gif, it knows that foo.gif is the 
shared data model for whatever it represents. If it PUTs bar.gif, the 
effect actually will be simply to replace foo.gif with a new model.

Alternatively, if we are really talking about colors of shirts, then 
perhaps the MoST server would return a
&lt;shirt&gt;&lt;color&gt;#12aabb&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/shirt&gt; perhaps with some stylesheet that 
converts &lt;shirt&gt; into a user friendly representation and perhaps with the 
URL of a shirt editor (or perhaps the user has an editor for &lt;shirt&gt;s).

Again the problem is that just saying that agents transfer Representations 
is not enough of a constraint to have any useful understanding of what is 
going on.  Unless the content-type is the thing itself, it really tells you 
very little.  The only thing you an do with a representation (absent a data 
model) is receive it.

&gt; I'm afraid that meta modeling doesn't solve any problem. The next
&gt; problem is usually the meta meta model of that. And the meta meta meta
&gt; model of that.

I'm not sure what you are referencing here.  My point is simple that 
clients and servers should share data models and not simply transfer 
representations/views.  Communications between agents centers around 
synchronizing data models of particular referrents.  Effectively I am 
saying that each agent should implements Model-View-Controller locally and 
when its Model changes state, it should transfer that state change.

In contrast, ReST has clients transfer Views around.  Since in most 
application contexts it is very hard to know what changed in the model 
simply by an arbitrary view, ReST then requires a lot more coordination 
behavior to understand change in view means from a local (private) model 
perspective.

It sounds like by "model" you're referring to a primary

This jibes with the discomfort I expressed about treating the

A couple of points come to mind:

1. Content negotiation is confusing, and multiple representations

We're still talking about transferring representations of
resources, but expressing a preference for a single

The HTML4 spec describes an HTTP header called Link that can
specify one or more stylesheets appropriate for rendering a
resource for different media. I like this idea because it keeps
the rendering hints entirely outside of the representation of the
resource itself, which is what we've been talking about.

Link can also give the "global" links that appear at the top and
bottom of every page in a typical Web UI (index, contents, etc.),
though I don't think such links are typically displayed by
existing browsers.

See &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#h-14.6&gt;.
(There's a note that Link is not defined by HTTP/1.1.)

Exactly.  Yes.

Yes.  The only use of alternative content is in some form of 
transfer-encoding.  Both endpoints need to be talking about the same model.

Yes, you could say that.  The issue is that ReST does not sufficiently 
constrain the meaning of representation.  The ReST definition of 
representation is that what is transferred is a representation of a human 
concept or thing.  I am saying there is an intermediate step where we build 
a shared model of that concept or thing and manipulate the models in 
various ways.  The relationship between the model and any referent is 
entirely in the heads of humans.  The software deals only with models.

&gt; The HTML4 spec describes an HTTP header called Link that can
&gt; specify one or more stylesheets appropriate for rendering a
&gt; resource for different media. I like this idea because it keeps

&gt;

Exactly.  The XML/HTML world is moving in the MoST direction.  HTTP in 
general still seems to be stuck with ReST.  HTTP needs either a 
Content-View header (a generalization of the Link header) or it needs a 
Model-Location header.

I think we are very much on the same page here.

<pre>MoST is either ReST with additional constraints to achieve much greater 
levels of visibility or MoST supercedes ReST because ReST is useful only 
for web publishing and we want more.

I don't have a huge stake in defining ReST one way or another.  My personal 
view is that ReST is sufficiently semantically incoherent so you can go in 
whatever direction you like.  Try reading Roy's dissertation and figuring 
out the exact meaning of resource and representation in his paper and 
you'll see what I mean.

We had a discussion earlier about standardizing these things.
My conclusion is that the best way to standardize these things
is to associate each URI with a single shared data model.

But the types don't matter.  If you look at the
example of GETting foo.gif and PUTting bar.gif and
even if we know that the server accepts image/gif,
ReST still can't tell you what the result of the
PUT will be!  That strikes me as ridiculous.

&gt;     Alex&gt; In contrast, if a MoST client GETs a foo.gif, it knows that
&gt;     Alex&gt; foo.gif is the shared data model for whatever it
&gt;     Alex&gt; represents. If it PUTs bar.gif, the effect actually will be

&gt; Yep, but what about versioning? Some systems allow you to retrieve

&gt;
&gt; Having all that into a meta model makes things quite
&gt; complex. Inevitable you will make a meta-model that does not cover
&gt; everything.

If the data-model represents versions, then you
have versions.  If it doesn't, you don't. The only
way to accomplish this versioning is to have a
shared versioned data model.

More generally, the server always has SOME model.
All I want to do is expose it.  If you want to
build an app ABOUT the server, fine but that is
just some other model.  When you build that app,
you should expose *that* model.

Absent a shared model, you have NO way to
anticipate the result of ANY state change.

&gt;     &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that meta modeling doesn't solve any problem. The
&gt;     &gt;&gt; next problem is usually the meta meta model of that. And the
&gt;     &gt;&gt; meta meta meta model of that.
&gt;

&gt; retrospectively in time for example (if you view the system state at
&gt; now - 10 days, you get bar.gif instead of foo.gif what you got when
&gt; you actually had looked 10 days ago)

Again.  You have whatever model you have.  Absent
that model, you have no way to understand what
happens when you do a POST or PUT.  If you change
the model the server uses, that is fine.  You then
need to expose that.  If the model is a changelog
represented in XML e.g.
&lt;changelog&gt;
&lt;change date="200307060000" href="/foo.gif"&gt;
&lt;change date="200307100000" href="/bar.gif"&gt;
&lt;/changelog&gt;

You can allow or disallow PUTs to /foo.gif
/bar.gif or to the changelog itself.  All I'm
saying is that you have to expose SOME model and
the same goes for a changelog of this changelog.

&gt; And so forth. Now we have several competing meta models (just look at
&gt; the web services coordination/work flow/transaction/whatever specs
&gt; that are coming out at a rate of one a week).

At the end of the day, we are all just
synchronizing models of various referents.  I am
saying your life will be easier if you have
generic semantics for doing this rather than
custom developing a mapping between a PUT
representation and an underlying data model for
each URI!

&gt;     Alex&gt; I'm not sure what you are referencing here.  My point is

Subject:HTTP 4xx response entities<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Typically, entities in a 4xx response have been html messages giving details
of the error.  This is fine if the client is a web browser, but more or less
useless if the client doesn't work with html.  For instance, suppose you
have a client that GETs, POSTs, PUTs, and DELETEs XML documents.  If a PUT
fails, then an appropriate error response must be returned (e.g. 403
Forbidden).  Ideally, the response entity would given an indication of what
went wrong and the format of the entity would be something that the client
understood.  In this case, it makes sense that the response entity would
likely be XML since it was the content-type of the request entity.

So, where to go from here?  Is there a specification for conveying "error"
information? If not, I would like to propose the following:

The general format would be something like:

&lt;responseMetadata level="" code=""&gt;
    details
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;

"level" can be either "HTTP" or "APPLICATION".  "HTTP" would be used to
provide extended response information beyond what HTTP currently allows.
For instance, if the response were 406 (Not Acceptable), the details could
list the possible content-types that could be returned. "APPLICATION" would
be used to provide extended response information about the processing
application.  For instance, when the PUT of an XML document fails due to an
invalid value, this level would be used to indicate the failure was not at
the HTTP level.

    Note: "realm" or "type" may be a better name than "level".

"code" is a akin to an error number.  The type of code used depends on the
value of "level".  If level="HTTP", then the code would be the same as the
HTTP response code (e.g., if a 403 response is sent, then code="403").  If
level="APPLICATION", then the possible values of code are
application-specific.

    Note: Maybe for level="HTTP", the "code" would be left off, as it is
redundant.

The "details" would be additional markup specific to the level and code
given.  In the case of level="HTTP", this specification would be fleshed out
to include "standard" markup for each response code (if there is any).  For
level="APPLICATION", the nature of the markup is entirely
application-specific.

For example:

1) POST an "application/xml" document returns:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/responseMetadata+xml

&lt;responseMetadata level="APPLICATION" code="14"&gt;
    &lt;!-- code="14" indicates a missing element in
        the request. In this case, "identity". --&gt;
    &lt;element name="identity"/&gt;
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;

2) GET an "text/oddball" document returns:

HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Content-Type: application/responseMetadata+xml

&lt;responseMetadata level="HTTP"&gt;
    &lt;!-- listed in order of preference? --&gt;
    &lt;content-type value="text/xml"/&gt;
    &lt;content-type value="application/xml"/&gt;
    &lt;content-type value="image/gif"/&gt;
    &lt;content-type value="text/html"/&gt;
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;



Additional notes:

1) This could also be used for 5xx responses.

2) This could technique *could* be used to respond to OPTIONS request (with
a 200 response).  For level="HTTP", additional information about the list of
understood request headers and their possible values could be given.  For
level="APPLICATION", additional application-specific information about the
resource could be given.

3) Though this response could be used for requests other than POSTing and
PUTing of XML documents, an additional level of "XML" may be provided, where
a series of codes and detail would be provided which correspond to the
well-formedness rules in the XML specification.  Is there maybe a list like
this already?

At any rate, you all get the idea... what do you think?

<pre>&gt; MoST is either ReST with additional constraints to achieve much greater

&gt;
&gt; I don't have a huge stake in defining ReST one way or another.  My 
&gt; personal
&gt; view is that ReST is sufficiently semantically incoherent so you can 
&gt; go in
&gt; whatever direction you like.  Try reading Roy's dissertation and 
&gt; figuring
&gt; out the exact meaning of resource and representation in his paper and
&gt; you'll see what I mean.

Well, now that's a completely clueless statement.  The point of the
definitions is that the interface does not define the exact meaning,
leaving meaning to be defined by the nature of the links between
the information.  A server does the interpolation between the contents
of a PUT and the model hidden behind the server -- saying that isn't
defined by REST is just goofy.  I have no problems building PUT,
containers, or any of the other things that you claim are not defined
by REST, since those are implementation details that are defined within
HTTP by the origin server and not by the client.  I don't even need to
use webdav, though it has its definitions as well.  The only problems
I run into are buggy browsers that never managed to implement basic
HTTP correctly, let alone the advanced features.

If you don't like the generic interface, then just implement a
distributed file system.  That has all the features you are looking
for in a concrete model.

Roy,

Small point to pick nits, but I thought we'd converged on this point 
before...

What's the difference between the Web and a distributed filesystem such 
as Plan 9's 9P or Amoeba's Bullet File System?

Who says distributed filesystems don't have generic interfaces?

IMHO, there differences between REST and the architectural styles of 
certain distributed filesystems are rather superficial.  You could 
easily tool out various filesystem implementations (I'm particularly 
thinking of e.g. Amoeba's) to strictly conform to REST at a high level. 
  (Not sure why you'd want to, but that's a different matter entirely.)

A shared data model between client and server for directories,
metadata, and content.  Basically, the same as the difference
between REST and Alex's notion of MoST, which is why I said he
might as well use a distributed file system.

&gt; Who says distributed filesystems don't have generic interfaces?

Sorry, I should have said "REST's definitions of resource and
representation" rather than "generic interface".  I was talking
about that specific interface, not the notion in general.

&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 31, 2003 3:48 AM
&gt; To: rest-discuss
&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] HTTP 4xx response entities
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Typically, entities in a 4xx response have been html messages
&gt; giving details
&gt; of the error.  This is fine if the client is a web browser, but
&gt; more or less
&gt; useless if the client doesn't work with html.  For instance, suppose you
&gt; have a client that GETs, POSTs, PUTs, and DELETEs XML documents.  If a PUT
&gt; fails, then an appropriate error response must be returned (e.g. 403
&gt; Forbidden).  Ideally, the response entity would given an
&gt; indication of what
&gt; went wrong and the format of the entity would be something that the client
&gt; understood.  In this case, it makes sense that the response entity would
&gt; likely be XML since it was the content-type of the request entity.
&gt;
&gt; So, where to go from here?  Is there a specification for conveying "error"
&gt; information? If not, I would like to propose the following:
&gt;
&gt; The general format would be something like:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;responseMetadata level="" code=""&gt;
&gt;     details
&gt; &lt;/responseMetadata&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "level" can be either "HTTP" or "APPLICATION".  "HTTP" would be used to
&gt; provide extended response information beyond what HTTP currently allows.
&gt; For instance, if the response were 406 (Not Acceptable), the details could
&gt; list the possible content-types that could be returned.
&gt; "APPLICATION" would
&gt; be used to provide extended response information about the processing
&gt; application.  For instance, when the PUT of an XML document fails
&gt; due to an
&gt; invalid value, this level would be used to indicate the failure was not at
&gt; the HTTP level.
&gt;
&gt;     Note: "realm" or "type" may be a better name than "level".
&gt;
&gt; "code" is a akin to an error number.  The type of code used depends on the
&gt; value of "level".  If level="HTTP", then the code would be the same as the
&gt; HTTP response code (e.g., if a 403 response is sent, then code="403").  If
&gt; level="APPLICATION", then the possible values of code are
&gt; application-specific.
&gt;
&gt;     Note: Maybe for level="HTTP", the "code" would be left off, as it is
&gt; redundant.
&gt;
&gt; The "details" would be additional markup specific to the level and code
&gt; given.  In the case of level="HTTP", this specification would be
&gt; fleshed out
&gt; to include "standard" markup for each response code (if there is
&gt; any).  For
&gt; level="APPLICATION", the nature of the markup is entirely
&gt; application-specific.
&gt;
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt; 1) POST an "application/xml" document returns:
&gt;
&gt; HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
&gt; Content-Type: application/responseMetadata+xml
&gt;
&gt; &lt;responseMetadata level="APPLICATION" code="14"&gt;
&gt;     &lt;!-- code="14" indicates a missing element in
&gt;         the request. In this case, "identity". --&gt;
&gt;     &lt;element name="identity"/&gt;
&gt; &lt;/responseMetadata&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2) GET an "text/oddball" document returns:
&gt;
&gt; HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
&gt; Content-Type: application/responseMetadata+xml
&gt;
&gt; &lt;responseMetadata level="HTTP"&gt;
&gt;     &lt;!-- listed in order of preference? --&gt;
&gt;     &lt;content-type value="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;content-type value="application/xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;content-type value="image/gif"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;content-type value="text/html"/&gt;
&gt; &lt;/responseMetadata&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Additional notes:
&gt;
&gt; 1) This could also be used for 5xx responses.
&gt;
&gt; 2) This could technique *could* be used to respond to OPTIONS
&gt; request (with
&gt; a 200 response).  For level="HTTP", additional information about
&gt; the list of
&gt; understood request headers and their possible values could be given.  For
&gt; level="APPLICATION", additional application-specific information about the
&gt; resource could be given.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Though this response could be used for requests other than POSTing and
&gt; PUTing of XML documents, an additional level of "XML" may be
&gt; provided, where
&gt; a series of codes and detail would be provided which correspond to the

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hmm... I do see the similarities.  However, I was hoping for something
stand-alone.  I do like the idea of using element-naming instead of the
"code" attribute.  The original example might look something like:

&lt;responseMetadata level="APPLICATION"&gt;
    &lt;missingElement name="identity"/&gt;
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;

I do not see a need for extensability here, with the possible exception of
providing more values for "level".  For instance,

&lt;responseMetadata level="WebDAV"&gt;
    &lt;D:error xmlns:D="DAV:"&gt;
        &lt;must-be-checked-in/&gt;
    &lt;/D:error&gt;
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;

or it could be simplified to:

&lt;responseMetadata level="WebDAV"&gt;
        &lt;must-be-checked-in/&gt;
&lt;/responseMetadata&gt;

After all, the "error" bit is redundant if receiving this in a 4xx (Client
Error) response.  On the other hand, it may be that WebDAV would fall under
the "APPLICATION" level...

Subject:403 vs. 409<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.  Should a
403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?  Only 409 talks about
informing the client of how the problem might be fixed.  However, 409 talks
about conflicts with the resource.  I would not consider an error in the
request entity to be a "conflict", as it was never even compared to the
existing resource (if one even exists).  On the other hand, 403 doesn't
contain any language about correcting the problem and trying again (but it
also doesn't say *not* to do so), though it does say that the response
should indicate the problem.

So, is 403 the prefered response or is it 409?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Re: MoST - Model State Transfer (was Pure-REST Wiki experiment)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Roy,

If there is other source material on ReST than your dissertation, please 
let me know.
Here are the key quotes:
"""
The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information 
that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal 
service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other 
resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other words, 
any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext reference 
must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a conceptual 
mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the 
mapping at any particular point in time.
"""

"""
REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation to 
capture the current or intended state of that resource and transferring 
that representation between components. A representation is a sequence of 
bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those bytes. Other commonly 
used but less precise names for a representation include: document, file, 
and HTTP message entity, instance, or variant.
"""

The elephant in the room here is that we have no way to talk about HOW a 
representation captures the current state of a resource nor do we have a 
way of knowing what to do with "intended state."  How do we differentiate 
between e.g. disagreements about the accuracy of a representation and 
attempts to change the underlying resource?  And if we intend to change the 
underlying resource, how does a client know what change will result from 
the presentation of a particular representation?

The reality is that both client and server need a shared model for mapping 
between "representations" and "resources."  I am just saying we might as 
well make the model explicit rather than developing custom mappings for 
every single URI.

You advocate for ReST by saying:
"""
REST provides a hybrid of all three options by focusing on a shared 
understanding of data types with metadata, but limiting the scope of what 
is revealed to a standardized interface. REST components communicate by 
transferring a representation of a resource in a format matching one of an 
evolving set of standard data types, selected dynamically based on the 
capabilities or desires of the recipient and the nature of the resource.
"""

The problem is that absent a shared MODEL having a shared understanding of 
data types with metadata is useless.  I may understand GIF format and that 
a GIF is intended to represent the current state of a resource, but unless 
I know the relationship between the GIF and the underlying resource its 
pretty worthless.  If I GET a GIF of a ":-)"does that mean a resource is 
happy?  If I PUT a ":-(" back does that make the resource sad?  So we have 
a 1-bit database field that gets updated by these images?  Or perhaps the 
resource simply storing a random GIF and I can store any GIF there?  How 
should I know?

At this point, you may argue that all that we are talking about is the 
referent of the URI.  My point is that we need to do the work to get to the 
point where we understand whether we are talking about a 1-bit database 
field or about a random BLOB store.  Since ReST mandates that the 
relationship between a representation and a resource is entirely arbitrary, 
these relationships end up being negotiated on a URI by URI basis and 
visibility suffers to the point of near-blindness.

We can achieve a MUCH higher level of visibility if constrain resources 
simply to be model stores (think MVC).
Models are data combined with meta-data constraining how it may be changed. 
In the real-world, this metadata takes the form of content-types and 
XML-schema.  Obviously the effect of updating a model in a particular store 
is still application specific, but at least we can now understand 
communication back and forth as being ABOUT updating a model.  Taking this 
idea to its logical conclusion would allow a new sort of proxy that could 
collect a set of PUT and POSTs into a batch update to a resource when it 
actually connects.

Just to knock this point home, in your mail you say:
&gt; The point of the definitions is that the interface does not define the 
exact meaning,
&gt; leaving meaning to be defined by the nature of the links between
&gt; the information.

My point is that it defines NO MEANING AT ALL!  All the work put into 
schemas and content-types are effectively useless without special purpose 
knowledge about each URI that ReST thinks should remain hidden!

&gt; A server does the interpolation between the contents
&gt; of a PUT and the model hidden behind the server -- saying that isn't
&gt; defined by REST is just goofy.

I think it is goofy that ReST means that I can have absolutely no idea what 
the effect of PUT or POST actually is without an extended out of band 
conversation with the web server operator.

Flexibility comes in defining agents that themselves respond to changes in 
the model (either via internal notification, external notification, or 
perhaps GET from somewhere else).

Unless you know the relationship between the content returned from a GET 
and the underlying model, you have no way to know what it means.  Unless 
you know how the server will interpret a representation, you have no way to 
understand the effect of a PUT or POST and therefore no way to interact 
with the server programmatically.

&gt; If you don't like the generic interface, then just implement a
&gt; distributed file system.  That has all the features you are looking
&gt; for in a concrete model.

I want a generic interface.  However without some constraints on the 
meaning of the interface elements, you don't have one.  Instead you have a 
lot of special purpose interfaces which happen to share the same method 
names.
However, if you constrain the meaning of methods in terms of the resource 
data-model/content-type/schema, you do get a generic interface.

Regarding the DFS, how would you implement that with ReST without a large 
amount of documentation about the meaning of each method w/r/t each file 
and directory? However, if I'm willing to expose the model, then all I need 
is a XML schema for a DFS and I'm good to go.

&gt; Well, now that's a completely clueless statement.  The point of the
&gt; definitions is that the interface does not define the exact meaning,
&gt; leaving meaning to be defined by the nature of the links between
&gt; the information.  A server does the interpolation between the contents
&gt; of a PUT and the model hidden behind the server -- saying that isn't
&gt; defined by REST is just goofy.  I have no problems building PUT,
&gt; containers, or any of the other things that you claim are not defined
&gt; by REST, since those are implementation details that are defined within
&gt; HTTP by the origin server and not by the client.  I don't even need to
&gt; use webdav, though it has its definitions as well.  The only problems
&gt; I run into are buggy browsers that never managed to implement basic
&gt; HTTP correctly, let alone the advanced features.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't like the generic interface, then just implement a
&gt; distributed file system.  That has all the features you are looking
&gt; for in a concrete model.

That's true for every routine and function you call in this world. The
solution to this (not widely used yet, too many people seem to love C)
is the notion of pre- and postcondition:

1. If the client fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting
   all the conditions stated in the precondition,

2. then the server fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting
   all the conditions stated in the postcondition.

Everything beyond that is of no concern to the client.


Explicit pre- and postconditions are missing from REST, but that it is
all you need. If the precondition states that you can PUT, you can. If
the postcondition states that the result of the PUT is that a GET
returns the putted resource, than that's all there is.

If you seek an understanding of how different resouces work together
and how to accomplish certain tasks (booking a meeting with different
participans for example), that has and will always be part of the
documentation. That's just part of the architecture. UI don't see any
metamodel solving that problem.

<pre>ReST says that the relationship between the returned representation and the 
underlying model is entirely arbitrary.
So what is truly goofy is that, with ReST, I don't even know what the 
result of a GET means without out of band documentation! 
Pre/Post-conditions are really irrelevant to solving this problem.

Here is another way to think about this from an OO/MVC perspective:

* ReST: the web server should hide the data model and implement the viewer 
and controller itself.
(Pre/post-conditions are irrelevant to ReST because they are already 
enforced by the server-based controller.)

* MoST the web server should expose the data model (aka class instance or 
data+content-type/schema) and the client should implement the viewer and 
controller.
(Pre/post-conditions are irrelevant to MoST because they are covered in the 
content-type/schema definition.)

As a programmer, I would much rather code against a model with clearly 
articulated interface (specified by a content-type/schema) than I would 
against arbitrary ReST UI components.  Effectively ReST means writing 
screen-scraping applications.  In advocating MoST, I am claiming that 
screen-scraping is silly.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>That's what I thought, except when I was working on Jot (my RESTful blog
system) someone (forgot who) said that 400 indicated a problem with HTTP
layer itself (e.g. "host" header missing in HTTP/1.1) and should not be used
for application-level errors.  Currently, I am using 403, saying that an
invalid request entity (say, a non-well-formded XML document) would be
"forbidden". But the problem here is that the resource is what defines
whether the request entity is valid or not (even the well-formedness of an
XML document), so in *some* sense, a bad request entity "conflicts" with the
resource.

So, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is 403
for?  About the only example I could come up with was one mirroring a
filesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is marked
"read-only".  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid if it were not
read-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is not a conflict,
necessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore not
appropriate for a 409 response.

<pre>&gt;Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.  Should
a
&gt;403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?  Only 409 talks about
&gt;informing the client of how the problem might be fixed.  However, 409
talks
&gt;about conflicts with the resource.  I would not consider an error in the
&gt;request entity to be a "conflict", as it was never even compared to the
&gt;existing resource (if one even exists).  On the other hand, 403 doesn't
&gt;contain any language about correcting the problem and trying again (but
it
&gt;also doesn't say *not* to do so), though it does say that the response
&gt;should indicate the problem.
&gt;
&gt;So, is 403 the prefered response or is it 409?
&gt;


Well all 4xx codes indicate a problem with the request.
Have you got a specific example? Do you mean something like missing
required information from a POST request?

I tend to use 400 for that sort of error, but I just checked, and 400
is explicitly for syntactic errors, rather than semantic ones. So I
guess that that isn't really right either. Is 400 intended only for
syntactic errors at the HTTP level such as illegal URIs, or would it
be allowed for syntactic errors at a higher level, such as if you
tried to PUT or POST a corrupt document, or refered to a badly formatted
identifier?

403 doesn't sound right to me, because I've always seen it as a kind
of "get lost" response for requests that have broke some sort of
out-of-band policy, such as for IP restricted sites, but I notice that
in the HTTP1.0 RFC, the description of 403 suggests that it can 
be used when other status codes are inappropriate, but that is for
1.0.

WebDAV defines a "422 Unprocessable entity" status for semantic
problems with the XML request, and uses 400 if the XML request is not
properly formed. I don't see why WebDAV would be a special case here,
so that sounds wrong too.

I wouldn't worry about 403 not specifying that the body should contain
instructions on how to remedy the problem though, because the text
describing
4xx codes in general says that the server SHOULD include a body describing
the
error for all of these codes.

RFC2616 says:

Why wouldn't 400 in this case be the ideal way to drive the

b, I'd say, keeping in mind that "successful data processing" can
include the determination of some "invalid" information within that

Where you draw this line is up to the needs of your application,
which is why I say "sometimes 400, sometimes 200" (but mostly 200,
in my experience).

&gt; How does 400 prevent the application from making progress?

Because it's an error.  An error response describes the specifics of the
error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,
except to do a logical "Back"; as far as the state of the application is
concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.

&gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application

Sec 6.1.1;

"HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
 to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
 understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
 understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
 digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
 x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
 unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached."

Message:<br><br>
<pre>So far, all I am seeing is that just about everyone has a different take on
whether to use 400, 403, or 409 (and maybe even 200 for POSTs).  I realize
that there are cut-and-dried cases that no one would argue with, but for
these other cases where everyone seems to have a different opinion, I am
wondering if maybe the best approach is to just pick the response(s) that
seem appropriate and document the decision.  In the end, I may choose to use
403 where some (though not all) others think 409 would be more appropriate.
However, as long as the documentation clearly indicates which responses to
expect for which occasions, can we all accept the difference of opinion and
move on?  I have continued to implement my code using 403 and have not yet
seen any compelling reasons to change it.  As long as people working with my
documented interface know that 403 is the expected response (among others),
does it really matter?

<pre>Mark,

&gt; &gt; What would you be telling intermediaries if you used 200 to reply
&gt; &gt; to a POST of some malformed content:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     a. that something was successfully appended or annotated?
&gt; &gt;     b. that some data processing was successfully performed?
&gt;
&gt; b, I'd say, keeping in mind that "successful data processing" can
&gt; include the determination of some "invalid" information within that
&gt; data, such as non-well-formed XML, or an invalid credit card number.
&gt; Where you draw this line is up to the needs of your application,
&gt; which is why I say "sometimes 400, sometimes 200" (but mostly 200,
&gt; in my experience).

Well, in my *inexperience* that looks like a loss of visibility.  I
understand
syntax error to be a condition that aborts meaningful processing, and this
is application level protocol, so the status code should tell us about how
effectively state was transferred, not how effectively bits were
transported.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Why wouldn't 400 in this case be the ideal way to drive the
&gt; &gt; application in asking for the data again after correcting syntax?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How does 400 prevent the application from making progress?
&gt;
&gt; Because it's an error.  An error response describes the specifics of the
&gt; error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,
&gt; except to do a logical "Back"; as far as the state of the application is
&gt; concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.

"Back" seems more like a browser idiom.  I would say that the absence
of a 2xx is the absence of a forward transition, which leaves application
state
right where it was.  In this case, the "way to proceed" is to correct syntax
and try again.  What am I missing?

Another thought: the details of a malformed request and an aborted
state transition are analogous to (or perhaps just examples of)
conversational state.  Not part of the "application state" model.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application
&gt; &gt; unsure about specific status codes can/should punt and use the x00
&gt; &gt; in the appropriate category?  Doesn't seem to say that in 2616 for
&gt; &gt; the 400 family.
&gt;
&gt; Sec 6.1.1;
&gt;
&gt; "HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
&gt;  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
&gt;  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
&gt;  understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
&gt;  digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
&gt;  x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
&gt;  unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached."

Ah, thanks.  So it would seem the part of 2616 that says 400 is about
syntax error specifically kind of violates that class/subclass thing, since
other 4xx responses are not about syntax.  Season to taste?

&gt; the history.

It seems that this is just a shortcoming in HTTP. 4xx is for client errors.
We are definitvely talking about a client error. In the absence of a more
specific code (401...), one would use 400. But 400 is defined as:

"The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications." (RFC2616:
status 400)

WebDAV defines 422 for:

"The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the
content type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type)
status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is
correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was
unable to process the contained instructions. For example, this error
condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e.,
syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous XML instructions."
(RFC2518)

So the point of view seems to be that the request entitity indeed had
wellformed syntax, but wasn't semantically valid. Now we all know that the
boundaries between syntax and semantics aren't THAT well-defined. So even
though the request body may be well-formed XML, an HTTP server could still
claim a syntax error.

It seems that the WebDAV WG didn't want to choose that direction and just
defined a new, more specific status code. This is perfectly ok, any client
that doesn't know 422 will have to treat it as 400, so no harm is done. As
WebDAV is the product of an IETF working group (and is currently progressing
to the next standards level), 422 is definitively here to stay, so I'd
recommend just to adopt it.

(it would be interesting to reseacg up how the WG came up with this design)

Your application requires that the POST conform to a particular schema and 
that schema has been violated.  2616 does not say that the value of the 
content-type header is bad, but that the actual media-type is bad.  XML DTD 
and schema have already moved a lot of media-type information outside of 
the content-type header.  Isn't 415 the status code to use if the client is 
violating schema requirements?

Subject:Jot, RNA and ReST vs MoST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Seairth, I just took a look at your blog and your comments on Jot/ReSTful 
blog architecture and at RNA &lt;http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49&gt; and 
&lt;http://www.seairth.com/blog/jot/docs/6&gt; &lt;http://www.seairth.com/web/rna/&gt;

These specs strike me as excessively complex.  By forcing applications 
interface specifications to include both a set of verbs and the 
content-types/schemas allowed w/r/t those verbs we lose all the visibility 
and genericity that ReST is intended to promise.

If we had a standard mapping between HTTP methods and underlying 
content-types, everything would get MUCH simpler.  The most useful mapping 
would be from HTTP to XML and would probably look something like this:

GET /myRSSblog returns an XML document.
POST /myRSSblog#channelId adds a new child to the XML node with that id.
GET /myRSSblog#itemId returns an XML node with that id
PUT /myRSSblog#itemId replaces the XML node with that id
DELETE /myRSSblog#itemId deletes the XML node with that id
(Style using &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="yourstyle.xsl"?&gt; for 
your viewing pleasure.)

Now you don't need any special purpose plumbing for indexing, mapping to 
directory structure, or all sorts of other annoying administrivia.  If you 
are maintaing a blog and you want to switch from RSS to nEcho just use an 
xslt transform and update your stylesheet.  No special purpose plumbing 
required....

Similarly, you can simplify the RNA spec to an addressbook/subscribers 
schema and an INBOX schema.  Sending messages obviously is just a POST to 
an inbox, etc.

For total coverage, a wiki is also just an XML document with client-side 
javascript placed in the stylesheet that does the wikitext rendering.  You 
can even standardize the rendering by using a script-src rather than 
bundling your own (it is also, therefore, more likely to be cached).  The 
existing wiki systems encourage proliferation of wikitext formats because 
the rendering is done on the servers.

Thoughts?  Any reason why things need to be more complex than this?

-Alex-

PS The point of my advocating Model State Transfer over Representational 
State Transfer is precisely that I think ReST forces servers to implement 
all sorts of special purpose plumbing to hide the data model rather than 
just assuming that other agents (perhaps residing on the server) will do 
data model conversions if needed. I'd like to get to get rid of 
content-negotiation and get to the point where the content-type/xml-schema 
of a resource is all you need to know in order to interact with it.

<pre>Okay... now we are up to:

400
or 403
or 409
or 415
(or sometimes 200)


I am unsure about using 415, though.  If someone POSTs/PUTs an "text/xml"
request entity (that happens to not  be well-formed) and gets back a 415,
how likely are they to know that it's the entity itself that's not valid,
not necessarily the content-type they said it was?  I know you could convey
this information in the response entity, but let's face it, the only
successful use of this is with HTML, which isn't at all program-friendly.
As a result, you have one of the following choices:

1) Use the code that's closest and hope the client understands it.
2) Use 400 generally and come up with an xml-based (since the request was
supposedly xml) response entity that conveys all possible information.  Then
make sure all clients know how to use this xml-based specification.
3) Create a new 4xx response code that means *exactly* what you want it to
mean.  Then make sure all clients now how to handle that response code (or
fall back to 400 equivalence and rely on option #1).

&gt; &gt; Where you draw this line is up to the needs of your application,
&gt; &gt; which is why I say "sometimes 400, sometimes 200" (but mostly 200,
&gt; &gt; in my experience).
&gt; 
&gt; Well, in my *inexperience* that looks like a loss of visibility.  I
&gt; understand
&gt; syntax error to be a condition that aborts meaningful processing, and this
&gt; is application level protocol, so the status code should tell us about how
&gt; effectively state was transferred, not how effectively bits were
&gt; transported.

Agreed.  If the state was transferred such that it was "processed", then
it's a success.  One can, I believe, quite reasonably define "processed"
to include determining whether an XML document was well-formed or not
... if that meets your needs.

&gt; &gt; Because it's an error.  An error response describes the specifics of the
&gt; &gt; error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,
&gt; &gt; except to do a logical "Back"; as far as the state of the application is
&gt; &gt; concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.
&gt; 
&gt; "Back" seems more like a browser idiom.  I would say that the absence
&gt; of a 2xx is the absence of a forward transition, which leaves application
&gt; state
&gt; right where it was.  In this case, the "way to proceed" is to correct syntax
&gt; and try again.  What am I missing?

No, you got it, that's what I meant.  "Back" from the "400 page", so to
speak.

&gt; Another thought: the details of a malformed request and an aborted
&gt; state transition are analogous to (or perhaps just examples of)
&gt; conversational state.  Not part of the "application state" model.

Hmmm.. dunno.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application
&gt; &gt; &gt; unsure about specific status codes can/should punt and use the x00
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the appropriate category?  Doesn't seem to say that in 2616 for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 400 family.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sec 6.1.1;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
&gt; &gt;  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
&gt; &gt;  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
&gt; &gt;  understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
&gt; &gt;  digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
&gt; &gt;  x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
&gt; &gt;  unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached."
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, thanks.  So it would seem the part of 2616 that says 400 is about
&gt; syntax error specifically kind of violates that class/subclass thing, since
&gt; other 4xx responses are not about syntax.  Season to taste?

Dunno, you'll have to ask the editors.

Even in the latter case, I'd say it's just fine.  If your application

There's probably a more accurate way to describe that in terms of
application state, but I can't come up with it right now.

FWIW, 2xx is also like this, as 202 doesn't mean "processed".  Henrik
told me this was a legacy issue that wasn't felt to warrant changing
the first-character rule.

<pre>If 415 means only that the server doesn't like the content-type header, its 
a pretty worthless status code.

Following ward cunningham's FIT model for specifications, here is a table 
of conditions(hopefully your mailreader uses a fixed width font):

					content-type   ctype
content-type request-entity   acceptable	matchesbody	entity-acceptable 
status
text/plain		JPEG			No 		No		No		 415
text/plain		rss2			No		No		Yes		 ???
text/xml		rss.91		No		Yes		No		 415
text/xml		rss2			No 		Yes		Yes 		 ???
text/xml		urlencoded		Yes		No		No		 ???
text/xml		urlencoded		Yes		No		Yes		 ???
text/xml		rss.91 		Yes		Yes		No		 ???
text/xml		rss2			Yes		Yes		Yes		 20x

Answering your question formally means filling in this sort of table.

To me, the only thing that matters is whether the entity-body is 
acceptable.  Forcing content-type header checks is just an annoyance 
because usually only one sort of entity-body is acceptable and there are no 
"warning" status codes.  I would fill in 415 on every line where 
entity-acceptable is no.  What would you do?

&gt; convey this information in the response entity, but let's face it, the
&gt; only successful use of this is with HTML, which isn't at all
&gt; program-friendly. As a result, you have one of the following choices:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Use the code that's closest and hope the client understands it.
&gt; 2) Use 400 generally and come up with an xml-based (since the request was
&gt; supposedly xml) response entity that conveys all possible information.
&gt; Then make sure all clients know how to use this xml-based specification.
&gt; 3) Create a new 4xx response code that means *exactly* what you want it to
&gt; mean.  Then make sure all clients now how to handle that response code (or
&gt; fall back to 400 equivalence and rely on option #1).

&gt;&gt; Why isn't the correct response 415 (Unsupported Media Type)?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your application requires that the POST conform to a particular schema
&gt;&gt; and that schema has been violated.  2616 does not say that the value of
&gt;&gt; the content-type header is bad, but that the actual media-type is bad.
&gt;&gt; XML
&gt; DTD
&gt;&gt; and schema have already moved a lot of media-type information outside of
&gt;&gt; the content-type header.  Isn't 415 the status code to use if the client

&gt;&gt; violating schema requirements?

&gt;&gt; &gt; That's what I thought, except when I was working on Jot (my RESTful
&gt;&gt; &gt; blog system) someone (forgot who) said that 400 indicated a problem
&gt;&gt; &gt; with HTTP layer itself (e.g. "host" header missing in HTTP/1.1) and
&gt;&gt; &gt; should not be used for application-level errors.  Currently, I am
&gt;&gt; &gt; using 403, saying that an invalid request entity (say, a
&gt;&gt; &gt; non-well-formded XML document) would be "forbidden". But the problem
&gt;&gt; &gt; here is that the resource is what defines whether the request entity
&gt;&gt; &gt; is valid or not (even the well-formedness of an XML document), so in
&gt;&gt; &gt; *some* sense, a bad request entity "conflicts" with the resource.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; So, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is
&gt;&gt; &gt; 403 for?  About the only example I could come up with was one
&gt;&gt; &gt; mirroring a filesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is
&gt;&gt; &gt; marked "read-only".  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid
&gt;&gt; &gt; if it were not read-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is
&gt;&gt; &gt; not a
&gt; conflict,
&gt;&gt; &gt; necessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore
&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt; appropriate for a 409 response.

&gt; If 415 means only that the server doesn't like the content-type header,
its
&gt; a pretty worthless status code.

I disagree.  For instance, if a resource is an JPG image and someone
attempts to PUT a PNG image, without even looking at the entity-body, the
server can reject the request.  There is no need to waste time/resources
processing the request entity to determine if it is even a JPG file since
the content-type clearly states that it is not.  Now, it may be that a
mismatched content-type/request-entity should also be a 415, but you are the
only one I have seen suggest it so far (not that it means your are wrong or
anything, just a lack of consensus).

&gt; Following ward cunningham's FIT model for specifications, here is a table
&gt; of conditions(hopefully your mailreader uses a fixed width font):
&gt;
&gt; content-type   ctype
&gt; content-type request-entity   acceptable matchesbody entity-acceptable
&gt; status
&gt; text/plain JPEG No No No 415

I agree.

&gt; text/plain rss2 No No Yes ???

415 (acceptable = No)

&gt; text/xml rss.91 No Yes No 415

Yes.

&gt; text/xml rss2 No Yes Yes ???

415 (acceptable = No)

&gt; text/xml urlencoded Yes No No ???

still ???

&gt; text/xml urlencoded Yes No Yes ???

still ???

&gt; text/xml rss.91 Yes Yes No ???

still ???

&gt; text/xml rss2 Yes Yes Yes 20x

I agree.

Or, in the format as above...

text/plain JPEG No No No 415
text/plain rss2 No No Yes 415
text/xml rss.91 No Yes No 415
text/xml rss2 No Yes Yes 415
text/xml urlencoded Yes No No ???
text/xml urlencoded Yes No Yes ???
text/xml rss.91 Yes Yes No ???
text/xml rss2 Yes Yes Yes 20x

All of the remaining ??? fundamentally fail because the entity-body does not
match the conent-type (whether the entity-body is valid in its own right or
not).

May be the question is if the failure is at the protocol level, application
level, or the resource-state level.  If the problem is at the HTTP level
(where HTTP itself believes something to be wrong), I'd think 400 would be
the correct response.  If the problem is at the application level (which
reads the entity-body and attempts to make sense of it), I'd think 403 is
the correct response.  If the problem is at the resource-state level (where
accepting the entity body would leave the resource in an invalid state),
then I'd think 409 is the correct response.

In truth, I am beginning to feel that no concensus is going to happen here
and that the best approach (for now) is to just document the decision and
move on.

<pre>Yes, the echo/atom API work is in fact what
started me thinking about MoST.  My point is that
we should not need an Atom API and a RSS API and a
Wiki API and a RNA/Notification API and a Foo API.

If servers exposed the underlying data model in a
consistent syntactic format, e.g. XML then the
only API you would need is the API for
manipulating that syntactic model.  The meaning of
changes to the model would be defined entirely by
the XML schema.

So, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to
RSS2 to RNA to ...., the API shouldn't change.
Its always be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE against XML node
ids and you know that this is the API because the
content-type is text/XML!

My objection to ReST is precisely that:
1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes
without out-of-band communication
-and-
2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent
*meaning* accross URI so API documentation ends up
being extensive.

You have 13 pages of documentation simply to
update an XML document with a well defined schema.
You are clearly a smart person. You should find it
frustrating to be spending your time writing such
a document and your should find it even more
frustrating to think about the number of
programmers who have to spend time reading and
understanding that document for your time
investment to pay-off.

If we just agreed that having content-type:
text/xml implied the GET/PUT/POST/DELETE semantics
against node ids that I described, it would save
everyone a lot of time and would fulfill the
simplicity promise that people have been looking
to ReST to deliver.

&gt; Yes, the echo/atom API work is in fact what
&gt; started me thinking about MoST.  My point is that
&gt; we should not need an Atom API and a RSS API and a
&gt; Wiki API and a RNA/Notification API and a Foo API.

So you are saying that I should be able to have an uber-client that would
know how to act with *any* resource merely be examing its schema?

&gt; If servers exposed the underlying data model in a
&gt; consistent syntactic format, e.g. XML then the
&gt; only API you would need is the API for
&gt; manipulating that syntactic model.  The meaning of
&gt; changes to the model would be defined entirely by
&gt; the XML schema.

Does this mean that the client is then in total control of the resource or
does the server still do its own checks to ensure resource integrity?

&gt; So, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to
&gt; RSS2 to RNA to ...., the API shouldn't change.
&gt; Its always be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE against XML node
&gt; ids and you know that this is the API because the
&gt; content-type is text/XML!

Whoa!  What does RNA have to do with Pie/RSS?  If that's what you think RNA
is about, you have totally missed the point behind RNA.  Sure, some facets
of blog systems (not RSS/Pie) could be implemented with RNA (which is what
my http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49 post was hinting at, though not
very successfuly).  But, to my knowledge, RNA is not interchangable with
*any* other specification I am aware of, regardless of how exposed you make
the data model.

&gt; My objection to ReST is precisely that:
&gt; 1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes
&gt; without out-of-band communication

True, but there is also no way to use any part of the web without at least
an initial amount of out-of-band communication.  And there have been
proposals such as Roger Costello's (et al.) Meta-Location header to help
expose information such as this.  It's not perfect, but it's a start...

&gt; 2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent
&gt; *meaning* accross URI so API documentation ends up
&gt; being extensive.

What do you mean by no consistent meaning?  Regardless of the application
used, I know the meaning of a GET.  I may not know what the results mean,
but I certainly know what the request means.  The same is pretty much true
for the other methods as well.  Now, I agree that they don't necessarily
have consistent implementation across URIs (e.g. some support only GET while
others support GET and PUT), but that's what an API (or RI or whatever) and
the HTTP 405 response is for (plus Allowed header).

&gt; You have 13 pages of documentation simply to
&gt; update an XML document with a well defined schema.
&gt; You are clearly a smart person. You should find it
&gt; frustrating to be spending your time writing such
&gt; a document and your should find it even more
&gt; frustrating to think about the number of
&gt; programmers who have to spend time reading and
&gt; understanding that document for your time
&gt; investment to pay-off.

Why not define a computer-processable schema language for RESTful
interfaces?  Then, you could just generate the appropriate wrapper code at
the push of a button based on such a schema.  Wouldn't a MoSTful schema
basically provide the same thing?

No.  It just means that the semantics of
GET/PUT/POST/DELETE are well defined.  The server
is resposible for maintaining the integrity of the
data model.  Authentication and authorization are
orthogonal.

&gt; &gt; So, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to

My point is that you should not need anything
beyond an XML schema to define the API.  If RNA
inboxes and addressbooks are enough for your app,
great.  If you need the stuff in echo or RSS thats
fine too.  Regardless, the documentation of the
schema should be enough to define the API.

&gt; &gt; My objection to ReST is precisely that:
&gt; &gt; 1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes

I mean per URI out-of-band data.

With MoST, given a URI, you can GET a resource and
know what the resulting content-type, schema, and
data actually mean.  ReST "Representations" mean
that the returned content-type, schema, and data
have no meaning without out-of-band documentation
giving mapping that result back to the state of
some hidden model.

With MoST, given the results of a GET, you know
how to manipulate it using POST/PUT/DELETE.  With
ReST you need a whole additional set of
documentation explaining how each of these
operations affects the state of the hidden model.

The meta-location header is an admission of the
failure of ReST to deliver the
visibility/interoperability it promises.
Meta-location is an admision that you have to
associate new interface semantics with each URI,
and that all ReST gives you is the guarantee that
the interface will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
as verb *names* and that GET will be idempotent.
Thats pretty weak.

&gt; &gt; 2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent

What does it mean to know the meaning of GET if
you don't know what the results mean?  What does

idea what you can POST and have no idea of the
effect of doing so?

&gt;
&gt; Why not define a computer-processable schema
&gt; language for RESTful interfaces?  Then, you

Because RPC is bad.  See Sec 6.5.2 of Roy's Thesis:
"""
What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources
using a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost
as well as by the machines that originate services. The result is an application that allows
for layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the information origin, which
is very useful for an Internet-scale, multi-organization, anarchically scalable
information system. RPC mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not
network-based applications.
"""
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_2

My complaint about ReST is that if fails to
deliver on the promise of HTTP that Roy so
eloquently articulates here.  Interfaces are no
longer generic but are instead URI specific.

&gt; Wouldn't a MoSTful schema basically provide the
&gt; same thing?

No.  MoST provides much more.  MoST delivers on
what ReST only promises, "generic interfaces with
standard semantics that can be interpreted by
intermediaries almost as well as" end-points as
well as end-points that can that can interact with
a resource with resorting to ANY out of band
documentation about it.

Okay.  I really must not be grasping what you are saying about REST vs MoST.
It seems to me that MoST is just an additional layer above ReST, but you
appearently believe the two architectures are dissimilar.  When you get a
working model of this MoST approach up, I would certainly like to see more.
Until then, I think the REST approach provides good guidelines that have
significantly improved (and are continuing to improve) the design of my
applications.  If you can offer something better, I'm all ears.  But at this

The URI addressability of node-ids is what you need to standardize - the
mapping between local data (an element in an XML document) and remote
resources (a URI). And that turns into XLink. Where among the
nodes/sub-nodes/etc is the URI for that node?

But you are right, define the set of resources and stick to
get/put/post/delete. I don't know how you'll avoid documentation of some
kind.

Subject:ReST vs MoST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>As I understand it, MoST is a data driven standardised interface. Stuck
to xml. But I've allway understood ReST in this way. if you get a uri,
you receive a representation (that you can unmarshall/deserialize,
however you're doing it), if you put a serialized/marshalled resource to
a uri, you update it (however the server deals with this
repressentation). if you post to a container uri, you append a resource
whatever it can mean in the server logic. 
as an example, a messaging service can be modeled as 
GET /my/inbox/ : return a list of messages' uri , in any format that is
understandable by server and client.
GET &lt;message uri&gt; : return a message, in any format...
POST /your/inbox/
message           : send a message ...
DELETE &lt;message uri&gt; : delete the message... this can just delete it
from the list, or delete the mapping of the uri, of delete the file, or
delete the DB record .... I don't have to know how the server understand
the representation, as long as the message uri become unreachable .

formats can be just mime for messages and a list of plain text 
"subject : uri " for inbox, as long as both client and server can
understand (i.e. parse/(de)serialize/(un)marshall) it. All you need to
know are these format (i.e. schemas, in a wide sense). but that is true
in any client/server system. 

This is a simple service, but it helps to understand.
How do you model this in MoST ??

But you will need something in addition to the schema, unless that

using a formal logic. At that point it would stop being a schema and 
become an ontology of the sort the semantic web people are 
advocating. Without that level of specification, you only have the 
API signatures, which are not adequate (any old OO salt knows this). 
Interoperation requires contracts to be grounded in behaviour aslo.

I agree with Seairth. MoST to me, sounds like a content model that 
would be a compliment to REST, but not a replacement. Certainly 
there's only so far you can go with mimetypes and conneg.

&gt;

You might want to say what you mean by 'mean'. For me here, 'mean' 
means machine processable metadata. Otherwise it's not so different 
from what we have now. Unless MoST has a formal semantics / model 
theory, I'm in dispute with your assertion and even them I think 
there are a few people on the list who will disagree with you.

Based on other emails in the thread, I suspect Alex would agree
that MoST is a further constraining of REST. Alex's arguments
about MoST being different from REST seem to be comparing MoST
constraints to the absence of constraints in REST, not to
expressed constraints in REST.

&gt; When you get
&gt; a working model of this MoST approach up, I would certainly like to see

I think the main impetus for MoST is the desire to have a more
constrained model for representations than just "a representation
of a resource at time t". The web-calculus uses a more narrowly
defined model and defines its generic interface in terms of this
model. I suspect the web-calculus satisfies the desires expressed
in this thread about MoST.

Alex, have you studied the web-calculus to see if it provides the
functionality you are looking for?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Jot, RNA and ReST vs MoST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Seairth and Bill,

The genius of ReST is its recognition of the value of a standardized 
resource interface in a heterogeneous large scale networked environments 
and its attempt to articulate such an interface.  Its tragic flaw is that 
it did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface to 
achieve the value it promised.  To be perfectly clear about the problem:

* Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the state of a 
resource into a response to a GET request, a client can have ABSOLUTELY NO 
IDEA what the content of that response means; it is simply has bits that 
can mean anything at all.

* Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses PUT/POST-ed 
content to change the state of a resource, a client can have ABSOLUTELY NO 
IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.

Roy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary and specified 
at the whim of the server operator on a per-URI basis.  I think these 
models should be standardized in some manner and be URI independent.

This conflict stems from different views of the nature of an HTTP resource 
itself.  Roy says:
"""
Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a 
temporal service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of 
other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other 
words, any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext 
reference must fit within the definition of a resource.
"""

Because Roy's resources are so abstract, access to them has to be mediated 
by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.  Allowing clients to interact 
with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then requires that 
service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to have essentially 
arbitrary meanings.

But resources don't really need to be so abstract and the meanings of HTTP 
methods don't need to be so loose.  Programs don't actually manipulate 
"concepts" or "non-virtual objects;" they just manipulate bits.  It would 
be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits 
whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose meaning 
is determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.  To say 
otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect between 
having an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a server 
notify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that there 
is a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP 
server itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the 
Internet and interacting via HTTP.

Viewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special* 
hidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent mediates 
access.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and across 
the Internet can use any data structures they want for their activities but 
that their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an HTTP 
server as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for communication 
between these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared *explicit 
model* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be 
changed.

Thanks to Roy and ReST we know the basic operations we need.  GET is a 
retrieval of whatever is on the universal blackboard at a particular 
location.  PUT replaces what is on the blackboard at that location.  DELETE 
erases it.  POST adds to it.  But we also need a shared *explicit model* of 
exactly how these operations work.  That project of defining these 
*explicit models* is what I am promoting under the name, MoST.

ReST is NOT a *standardized* interface (see my response to Seairth).

&gt; as an example, a messaging service can be modeled as

Once you have to document this model, you no longer have a standardized 
interface.  You now have to provide some mechanism for the client to 
discover and understand how to interact with this service (you lose 
visibility and interoperability).

&gt; POST /your/inbox/
&gt; message           : send a message ...
[...]
&gt; formats can be just mime for messages and a list of plain text
&gt; "subject : uri " for inbox,

How should a client know that this is the appropriate way to send a 
message?  It certainly violates the syntax your inbox type to append a MIME 
message to its end so we can't discover it that way.  Given the formats you 
describe, the obvious way to send a message is to PUT a message at some 
arbitrary newURI and then POST only "subject: newURI" to /your/inbox, but, 
according to your documentation that would be INCORRECT...  Sigh.

&gt; This is a simple service, but it helps to understand.
&gt; How do you model this in MoST ??

You don't, or at least not specifically!  MoST says that server operators 
should not be defining the meaning of resource interfaces; that these 
resource interfaces should be constrained entirely by their 
content-type/schema/format.  Note above how I gave the *obvious* way to 
send a message from your formats alone.  In practice, the documentation of 
your simple ReST messaging service would be verbose.  Even your abstract 
had 9 lines (not including the format description).  Aside from the format 
description, MoST requires NO DOCUMENTATION AT ALL.
Just GET the inbox, its format tells you everything you need to know to 
interact with it.  If you later switch to an XML inbox, again, you don't 
need any new documentation....

Yes.  That is correct.

&gt; I think the main impetus for MoST is the desire to have a more
&gt; constrained model for representations than just "a representation
&gt; of a resource at time t". The web-calculus uses a more narrowly
&gt; defined model and defines its generic interface in terms of this
&gt; model. I suspect the web-calculus satisfies the desires expressed
&gt; in this thread about MoST.

I took a look at the web calculus and I think it addresses an orthogonal 
problem.

MoST views HTTP as a blackboard communication interface for agents both on 
the server and across the Internet (See my response to Seairth) and just 
seeks to standardize the blackboard interface (not the interface to the 
agents themselves!).

If I am understanding the documentation I saw, the "web calculus" attempts 
to model how all of these agents across the Internet react to changes in 
what is on the blackboard.  That's a *very ambitious* enterprise and 
generalizes way beyond HTTP.  I am not in a position to judge the efficacy 
of your model, but, if it works, calling it simply a "web calculus" strikes 
me as *extremely* modest.

XLink is a user agent standard not an HTTP standard.  As you already noted,

may be much more than is needed simply for an HTTP binding.  I don't see 
any reason why HTTP exposed XML documents should not give every HTTP

is not sufficient, perhaps with ;node-id@attribute to address attributes. 
Perhaps someone more intimate with issues surrounding XML standards could 
take a shot at formalizing this more precisely (esp. w/r/t namespace 
semantics)....

Yes thanks.  I'm not saying we can avoid documentation per se.  I just want 
to avoid per-URI documentation.

Yes. but the majority of clients don't need to know what the content 
means (for some definition of means). Adding this to a transfer 
protocol would be an overconstraint. It's only now, that the web has 
grown without formal semantics, that we are in the position to 
wonder about whether we should have a tronger semantics. In some 
cases, such as web services I would say yes, a stronger semantic 
underpinning is useful. Consider that we've hade distributed 
computing models with decent semantics for longer that either the 
web  or REST and they have not been been adopted, not even when they 
are really quite good (such as FIPA).

So, I see no tragic flaw, just an opportunity :)


&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses PUT/POST-ed 
&gt; content to change the state of a resource, a client can have ABSOLUTELY 
&gt; NO IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.

Sure. But what exactly is the problem? Maybe premature formalization 
is the root of all evil.


&gt; Because Roy's resources are so abstract, access to them has to be 
&gt; mediated by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.  Allowing clients 
&gt; to interact with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then 
&gt; requires that service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to 
&gt; have essentially arbitrary meanings.

Well yes, but to avoid this each method needs a formal semantics and 
each protocol might well need a model theory. Consider KQML. That 
was far more formal that HTTP, yet it wasn't formal enough to stop 
interoperation problems and inter-agent confusion, and that's 
without any commercial incentive to differentiate.


&gt; But resources don't really need to be so abstract and the meanings of 
&gt; HTTP methods don't need to be so loose.  Programs don't actually 
&gt; manipulate "concepts" or "non-virtual objects;" they just manipulate 
&gt; bits.  

I think the kind of programs that result from what you are proposing 
will manipulate symbols first and foremost. Bits would be an 
implementation detail.


&gt; It would be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply 
&gt; a set of bits whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server 
&gt; and whose meaning is determined entirely by agents which interact with 
&gt; this server.  To say otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful 
&gt; difference in effect between having an agent poll a resource and act 
&gt; when it changes and having a server notify an agent to act whenever a 
&gt; resource is changed or to say that there is a meaningful difference 
&gt; between such an agent residing on the HTTP server itself and such an 
&gt; agent residing on another machine across the Internet and interacting 
&gt; via HTTP.

After half a decade, I've conluded that the best option regarding 
Web resources is to say as little as possible about them.


&gt; PS Bill, I have heard of speech acts, but I don't know how they apply here.

Each HTTP method can be understood as a speech act or performative 
used by a client to get a server to do something on their behalf. 
The server may refuse, comply, be silent, or do something completely 
nonsensical. So even after you model everything down the last 
degree, you still need two agents to intend to communicate 
effectively (ie something like Grice's maxims) or the ability to 
adapt to deceitful behaviour (ie utility models).

There isn't a direct correspondance, no more that CRUD is a direct 
correspondance to the REST uniform interface, but I've always 
thought of HTTP methods as a poor man speech acts.

As long as you know that /inbox/ is a container containing mime
messages, posting a mime message to /inbox/ add the message to the
container... you don't have to know that (for instance) the server
actually append the message to an mbox file, if you can GET you message
(even in text/html) to the url of the Location header and if the GET
/inbox/ return a list with the "subjet : uri" appended. 

&gt; &gt; This is a simple service, but it helps to understand.

delete to reset the container)

What does "mean" mean in this context?

&gt; PUT/POST-ed
&gt; content to change the state of a resource, a client can have 
&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO
&gt; IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.

That just says that REST doesn't mandate one single model.  Nothing
prevents the server from establishing a model and telling the client
what it is.  That is how hypertext works: the engine of application
state change.

&gt; Roy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary and 
&gt; specified
&gt; at the whim of the server operator on a per-URI basis.  I think these
&gt; models should be standardized in some manner and be URI independent.

They aren't entirely arbitrary; they are merely chosen by the server.
In some cases they will be selected from a standard (such as webdav).
In other cases they will be defined by an interface language (like 
WSDL).

&gt; Because Roy's resources are so abstract, access to them has to be 
&gt; mediated
&gt; by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.

Ah, so httpd modules must be gods.

&gt; Allowing clients to interact
&gt; with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then requires 
&gt; that
&gt; service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to have 
&gt; essentially
&gt; arbitrary meanings.

That doesn't follow at all.  Service operators control the 
implementation
of HTTP methods.  Methods get overloaded because service operators do 
want
additional semantics, but normal people don't know how to extend them 
and
implementers can't read protocol specs.  It is an artifact of the social
process surrounding standardized protocols.  You can't fix it by
forbidding the extension of methods.

&gt; But resources don't really need to be so abstract and the meanings of 
&gt; HTTP
&gt; methods don't need to be so loose.  Programs don't actually manipulate
&gt; "concepts" or "non-virtual objects;" they just manipulate bits.

Right.  It's people that manipulate concepts and non-virtual objects.

&gt;   It would
&gt; be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits
&gt; whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose 
&gt; meaning
&gt; is determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.

No it wouldn't, since such a definition ignores the ability of people
to anticipate changes that have not yet occurred.  Time is essential
to the meaning of a hypertext link, and thus the definition of resource.
HTTP servers store representations, not resources.

&gt;   To say
&gt; otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect 
&gt; between
&gt; having an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a 
&gt; server
&gt; notify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that 
&gt; there
&gt; is a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP
&gt; server itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the
&gt; Internet and interacting via HTTP.

Or simply that resource isn't what you think it means.

&gt; Viewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special*
&gt; hidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent 
&gt; mediates
&gt; access.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and 
&gt; across
&gt; the Internet can use any data structures they want for their 
&gt; activities but
&gt; that their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an 
&gt; HTTP
&gt; server as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for 
&gt; communication
&gt; between these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared 
&gt; *explicit
&gt; model* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be
&gt; changed.

The blackboard model is another architectural style with a lot of
interesting work associated with it.  Tuple-spaces use that.  The
problem with blackboards isn't just a lack of a data model;
they also have centralized identification and lack metadata.

I suspect the problem Alex really wants to fix is pinning down

They're optimal in the sense that they are meaningful (though perhaps
not "implemented") with every resource.  You'd know that they weren't
if there existed a single resource for which any of the methods were
not meaningful.

I sometimes liken this to java.lang.Object, for illustrative purposes.
If it included a method which didn't make sense to all objects, then
not all objects could extend it.

&gt; to having solid content models - I wish FIPA would get some 
&gt; marketing dollars behind it :)

I don't know what he means by "Content models".  RDF maybe?

I might have introduced that term into the thread. But yes RDF would 
be a content model or, a 'model of data'. XML itself isn't, but XML

I see the smiley; does that mean you do or don't see the difference
between "implements" and "meaningful"?  It's an important difference.

In case it's the former, "Allow" specifies which methods are
*implemented*, such as whether or not I choose to implement toString()
on some particular Java object of my own creation.  That toString()
is even *on* java.lang.Object at all, is what I mean by "meaningful";
putting a "walkDog()" method on java.lang.Object would be an example of
"not meaningful".

Ok, then maybe I agree with that part of his point.

I disagree with his emphasis on schemas.  They are just syntactic
rules, and normally used in an un-RESTful way (not self-descriptive).
What you need is an architectural property called "partial
understanding"[1] which allows machines to process the portion of a
document that they can, rather than the all-or-nothing approach
typically taken in the XML+ schema world.  RDF is very well suited to
this, as is TopicMaps.

Hi all:

 

Please excuse the cross-post but this may be of interest to both lists. We
are making available for comment a new RSS 1.0 Module 'mod_context':

 

      http://www2.elsevier.co.uk/~tony/spec/rss/mod_context.html
&lt;http://www2.elsevier.co.uk/~tony/spec/rss/mod_context.html&gt;  

 

Note that the URL is provisional and that we expect that the Module will be
subsequently lodged under the URL

 

      http://www.egroups.com/files/rss-dev/Modules/Proposed/mod_context.html
&lt;http://www.egroups.com/files/rss-dev/Modules/Proposed/mod_context.html&gt; 

 

The rationale in defining the 'mod_context' RSS 1.0 module is that this
module allows RSS 1.0 feeds to provide contextual information which relates
a description of the feed channel or item to the provenance of the feed, the
requester of the feed, and the where and how the feed should be processed.
Rich descriptions of this contextual information can be provided using both
identifiers and metadata. The OpenURL Framework data model exists to support
network applications in the provisioning of context-sensitive services. 

 

This draft RSS 1.0 module is being released to support applications that
wish to make use of the ANSI/NISO Draft Standard for Trial Use 'The OpenURL
Framework for Context-Sensitive Services'. It is anticipated that a revised
version of this module will be resubmitted following a successful ballot by
NISO Voting Members when the Draft Standard is published as currently
expected NISO Standard Z39.88-2003.

 

For further information on the OpenURL Framework see the Draft Standard
documents

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] ReST vs MoST Messaging<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; but whatever is your system, you'll always have to document it, i.e. to
&gt; describe formats, etc. You can't define a data format, and thus a set of
&gt; behaviours, that will fit any applications needs....

Again and to be perfectly clear:

THE FORMATS SHOULD BE *ALL* YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM'S BEHAVIOR

~90% of your specification described how to use HTTP with your resources
~10% was a description of the formats.

So, if you let MoST constrain your system around its formats, you would 
have achieved a 1000% productivity increase.

&gt; As long as you know that /inbox/ is a container containing mime
&gt; messages,

The question (again) is:

HOW do you know that /inbox/ actually is a container containing MIME 
messages?

Also, what does it mean actually to be a container?  FIFO? LIFO? by 
from-address...?  How does the shape of the container relate to your index 
format for representing it?

MoST provides enough constraints so that knowing *ONLY* your index format, 
a client can deliver mail.  The client does not need to know *anything* 
about how the server thinks about inboxes internally.

&gt; so describe your format. In this description, i wanted to be unambiguous,
&gt; but the knowledge that the /inbox/ is a container is sufficient, has I
&gt; know that i can POST to add a content and GET to obtain the listing (and
&gt; delete to reset the container)

Again, how does the client know that /inbox/ is a container and not simply 
an index?

Your inbox format was a list of plaintext "subject : uri"  A few years ago, 
DJ Bernstein proposed an alternative to SMTP which made mail storage the 
sender's responsibility.  Your inbox format caused me to assume you 
intended something similar.  It implies that mail delivery is simply adding 
an entry to an index and letting the client be responsible for storing the 
message at some URI.

However, if you want mail storage to be the recipient's responsibility, and 
you want messages in MIME format, you should use a format for your inbox 
that supports appending MIME messages e.g. mbox or multipart/digest.

Note that simply by defining your file formats correctly you can completely 
control the semantics of your application!

Also note that whether the server STORES the messages in these format is 
TOTALLY IRRELEVANT.  The point is only that by exposing the resource using 
this content-type, it is saying that the resource can be manipulated as if 
in fact it is represented on the server in that content type.  (See my 
response to Roy).

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Jot, RNA and ReST vs MoST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>In your dissertation, you say:
"""
REST components communicate by transferring a representation of a resource 
in a format matching one of an evolving set of standard data types, 
selected dynamically based on the capabilities or desires of the recipient 
and the nature of the resource. Whether the representation is in the same 
format as the raw source, or is derived from the source, remains hidden 
behind the interface.
[...]
Each origin server provides a generic interface to its services as a 
resource hierarchy. The resource implementation details are hidden behind 
the interface.
"""

MoST says that the semantics of this generic interface should apply to the 
exposed representation rather than the "hidden" one.  Because, if HTTP 
methods apply only to the exposed representation of a resource, then their 
semantics are constrained entirely by the HTTP protocol and the 
content-type of the subject resource and HTTP thereby becomes a truly 
generic interface (at least on a per-content-type basis).

However, if HTTP methods are intended to apply to the "hidden" 
representation then, aside from the fact that the "hidden" representation 
would not be truly hidden, the semantics of HTTP methods would need to 
include the mapping between hidden and external representations.  If this 
mapping varies from resource to resource then the semantics of HTTP methods 
cease to be generic as they depend on the behavior of each resource 
server's mapping functions.

Although, based on your comments quoted above, I believe MoST follows 
logically and necessarily from ReST, many of the people on this list appear 
to disagree.  They believe that HTTP methods should be interpreted as 
applying to the internal representations rather than the external ones, 
forcing me so articulate this issue as "ReST vs MoST" rather than "ReST 
implies MoST."

&gt;&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the &gt;&gt; 
state of a resource into a response to a GET request, a client &gt;&gt; can have 
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what the content of that response
&gt;&gt; means; it is simply has bits that can mean anything at all.
&gt;
&gt; What does "mean" mean in this context?

If I GET a number and that number is intended to *represent* another 
number, how do I know what functions were applied to the represented number 
to produce the representing number.  Was it only the identity function? Was 
ln() applied?  Was round() or floor() applied?  If I don't know the mapping 
function between the internal and external representations, exactly what do 
I know about a represented resource simply from GETting a  representation 
from its server?

&gt;&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses
&gt;&gt; PUT/POST-ed content to change the state of a resource, a client
&gt;&gt; can have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST
&gt;&gt; actually will be.
&gt;
&gt; That just says that REST doesn't mandate one single model.  Nothing
&gt; prevents the server from establishing a model and telling the client
&gt; what it is.  That is how hypertext works: the engine of application
&gt; state change.

Exactly how does hypertext tell me the relationship between a resource and 
its representation?

Following the above example, if I PUT a number to the server, how does 
hypertext tell me what transformations the server applies to that number to 
change the actual state of the resource?

Note absent this hypothetical hypertext engine, what you are really saying 
is that ReST allows every server to choose its own semantics for GET, PUT, 
POST and that all the advantages ReST claims from delivering a generic 
interface would be bogus.


&gt;&gt; Roy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary
&gt;&gt; and specified at the whim of the server operator on a per-URI
&gt;&gt; basis.  I think these models should be standardized in some
&gt;&gt; manner and be URI independent.
&gt;
&gt; They aren't entirely arbitrary; they are merely chosen by the server.

They are arbitrarily chosen by the server operator because the server 
operator can choose whichever internal representation suits his/her fancy.

&gt; In some cases they will be selected from a standard (such as webdav).
&gt; In other cases they will be defined by an interface language (like WSDL).

You used to think differently.  In your dissertation you say:

"""
The semantics are thus not defined by the network interface (IIOP), but by 
the object's IDL spec. Whether this is a good thing or not depends on the 
application -- for distributed objects it is a necessity, for the Web it 
isn't.
"""

Now you tell us that we need these IDLs (now taking the form of WSDL). 
What changed?

You used to want "generic interface with standard semantics that can be 
interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines that 
originate services."

You now appear to have abandoned that project in favor of per-service 
semantics.  What happened?

&gt;&gt; Allowing clients to interact with agents of this power and
&gt;&gt; complexity through HTTP then requires that service operators be
&gt;&gt; permitted to overload HTTP methods to have essentially arbitrary
&gt;&gt; meanings.
&gt;
&gt; That doesn't follow at all.  Service operators control the implementation
&gt; of HTTP methods.  Methods get overloaded because service operators do want
&gt; additional semantics, but normal people don't know how to extend them and
&gt; implementers can't read protocol specs.  It is an artifact of the social
&gt; process surrounding standardized protocols.  You can't fix it by
&gt; forbidding the extension of methods.

In another thread on this topic, Yannick wants to create an "inbox" 
resource that is represented by plaintext lines of "subject : uri".  He 
says that this format actually represents a container of MIME messages, 
that one can add a message to this container by POSTing message/rfc822, and 
that a GET of a URI in the inbox representation should return a 
message/rfc822.

In other words, Yannick arbitrarily overloads GET to return his new index 
format as a representation of a "hidden" container rather than e.g. a 
multipart/digest containing all the messages (no downloading of mail 
archives allowed!).  He arbitrarily overloads POST to take a message/rfc822 
and add it to this imaginary container (in what order?),  rather than e.g. 
taking text/xml+message and converting and rather than taking the POST 
content as a message body and constructing message headers from the HTTP 
headers.

I'm pretty sure that Yannick is doing nothing that contravenes any spec. 
But I am also pretty sure that there is a problem if all of these methods 
can mean so many different things for such a tiny application.  It means 
that we need documentation of how to use HTTP for each and every actual and 
hypothetical URI on the Internet.  It means we lose the whole notion of 
simple interoperability.

Perhaps we could use WSDL, but why not simply follow the rule that HTTP 
semantics operate on external representations.  Then Yannick's index format 
specifies everything about you need to know and we don't need him to tell 
us how to use HTTP to operate on his resources.  (See the other thread for 
details).

&gt;&gt; But resources don't really need to be so abstract and the meanings of
&gt;&gt; HTTP
&gt;&gt; methods don't need to be so loose.  Programs don't actually manipulate
&gt;&gt; "concepts" or "non-virtual objects;" they just manipulate bits.
&gt;
&gt; Right.  It's people that manipulate concepts and non-virtual objects.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;   It would
&gt;&gt; be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits
&gt;&gt; whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose
&gt;&gt; meaning
&gt;&gt; is determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.
&gt;
&gt; No it wouldn't, since such a definition ignores the ability of people
&gt; to anticipate changes that have not yet occurred.  Time is essential
&gt; to the meaning of a hypertext link, and thus the definition of resource.
&gt; HTTP servers store representations, not resources.




&gt;&gt;   To say
&gt;&gt; otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect
&gt;&gt; between
&gt;&gt; having an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a
&gt;&gt; server
&gt;&gt; notify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; is a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP
&gt;&gt; server itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the
&gt;&gt; Internet and interacting via HTTP.
&gt;
&gt; Or simply that resource isn't what you think it means.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Viewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special*
&gt;&gt; hidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent
&gt;&gt; mediates
&gt;&gt; access.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and
&gt;&gt; across
&gt;&gt; the Internet can use any data structures they want for their
&gt;&gt; activities but
&gt;&gt; that their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an
&gt;&gt; HTTP
&gt;&gt; server as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for
&gt;&gt; communication
&gt;&gt; between these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared
&gt;&gt; *explicit
&gt;&gt; model* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be
&gt;&gt; changed.
&gt;
&gt; The blackboard model is another architectural style with a lot of
&gt; interesting work associated with it.  Tuple-spaces use that.  The
&gt; problem with blackboards isn't just a lack of a data model;
&gt; they also have centralized identification and lack metadata.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; MoST says that the semantics of this generic interface should apply to 
&gt; the exposed representation rather than the "hidden" one.  Because, if 
&gt; HTTP methods apply only to the exposed representation of a resource, 
&gt; then their semantics are constrained entirely by the HTTP protocol and

&gt; truly generic interface (at least on a per-content-type basis).

&gt; methods would need to include the mapping between hidden and external 
&gt; representations.  If this mapping varies from resource to resource 
&gt; then the semantics of HTTP methods cease to be generic as they depend 
&gt; on the behavior of each resource server's mapping functions.

No.  Information comes in many different representations.  That does not
change the semantics of GET or PUT -- not even a tiny bit.  IF the 
server
allows a resource to be negotiable in terms of representations, then the
resource (that abstract concept mapping) is independent of the bits.
That means the server either must disallow PUT on that resource,
possibly redirecting the request to some other resource that is
bit-for-bit equivalent, or be capable of inspecting each PUT
representation for the new abstract state.  The latter is not too
difficult for many practical uses: Day's Communique product extracts
the atoms of content from the individual cells of table whether it
is PUT as an excel spreadsheet, an HTML table, or a Word RTF table.

&gt; Although, based on your comments quoted above, I believe MoST follows 
&gt; logically and necessarily from ReST, many of the people on this list

&gt; the external ones, forcing me so articulate this issue as "ReST vs 
&gt; MoST" rather than "ReST implies MoST."

They apply to representations depending upon how the resource is 
defined,
but they apply to the resource (as in changing its state) uniformly.  
The
problem is the way you view a resource -- if you constrain the notion of
a resource to being a stored representation, then you simply eliminate
the freedom of the server to choose whether the resource is going to
be negotiable in bit format.  There are good things and bad things
about such a model, but it certainly isn't necessary.  The Web works
fine without such a constraint.

&gt;&gt;&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the &gt;&gt;
&gt; state of a resource into a response to a GET request, a client &gt;&gt; can 
&gt; have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what the content of that response

&gt; function? Was ln() applied?  Was round() or floor() applied?  If I 
&gt; don't know the mapping function between the internal and external 
&gt; representations, exactly what do I know about a represented resource 
&gt; simply from GETting a  representation from its server?

Whatever is applied, it cannot change the information state.  Obviously,
that means round() and floor() are out of the question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT/POST-ed content to change the state of a resource, a client
&gt;&gt;&gt; can have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST

&gt;&gt; what it is.  That is how hypertext works: the engine of application
&gt;&gt; state change.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly how does hypertext tell me the relationship between a resource 
&gt; and its representation?

By including the identifier in a context of use wherein the relationship
is predefined, just as it is for an HTML anchor.

&gt; Following the above example, if I PUT a number to the server, how does 
&gt; hypertext tell me what transformations the server applies to that 
&gt; number to change the actual state of the resource?

It doesn't, because you don't need to know.

&gt; Note absent this hypothetical hypertext engine, what you are really 
&gt; saying is that ReST allows every server to choose its own semantics

&gt;&gt; process surrounding standardized protocols.  You can't fix it by
&gt;&gt; forbidding the extension of methods.
&gt;
&gt; In another thread on this topic, Yannick wants to create an "inbox" 
&gt; resource that is represented by plaintext lines of "subject : uri".  
&gt; He says that this format actually represents a container of MIME 
&gt; messages, that one can add a message to this container by POSTing 
&gt; message/rfc822, and that a GET of a URI in the inbox representation 
&gt; should return a message/rfc822.
&gt;
&gt; In other words, Yannick arbitrarily overloads GET to return his new 
&gt; index format as a representation of a "hidden" container rather than 
&gt; e.g. a multipart/digest containing all the messages (no downloading of 
&gt; mail archives allowed!).  He arbitrarily overloads POST to take a 
&gt; message/rfc822 and add it to this imaginary container (in what 
&gt; order?),  rather than e.g. taking text/xml+message and converting and 
&gt; rather than taking the POST content as a message body and constructing 
&gt; message headers from the HTTP headers.

Why "overloads"?  He is simply using those methods as they were defined.
He isn't defining an interface of bits -- he is defining an information
interface.

&gt; I'm pretty sure that Yannick is doing nothing that contravenes any 
&gt; spec. But I am also pretty sure that there is a problem if all of 
&gt; these methods can mean so many different things for such a tiny 
&gt; application.  It means that we need documentation of how to use HTTP 
&gt; for each and every actual and hypothetical URI on the Internet.  It 
&gt; means we lose the whole notion of simple interoperability.

No, it doesn't -- you have no basis for such a claim.

&gt; Perhaps we could use WSDL, but why not simply follow the rule that 
&gt; HTTP semantics operate on external representations.  Then Yannick's 
&gt; index format specifies everything about you need to know and we don't 
&gt; need him to tell us how to use HTTP to operate on his resources.  (See 
&gt; the other thread for details).

Because HTTP semantics do not operate on external representations,
and therefore any attempt to claim such a rule for the general case
is false.  HTTP needs to be flexible to support gateways and legacy
systems for which the semantics you are demanding simply do not apply.

That does not prevent you from applying that rule in a specific case,
such as in a specific set of resources that your software is going
to be interacting with -- such an additional constraint is still
compatible with REST-based systems and may have some additional
properties that make it worthwhile, but you should also document
the trade-offs: those properties that are degraded by applying
that rule.

&gt; &gt; but whatever is your system, you'll always have to document it, i.e. to
&gt; &gt; describe formats, etc. You can't define a data format, and thus a set of
&gt; &gt; behaviours, that will fit any applications needs....
&gt; 
&gt; Again and to be perfectly clear:
&gt; 
&gt; THE FORMATS SHOULD BE *ALL* YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM'S BEHAVIOR
&gt; 
&gt; ~90% of your specification described how to use HTTP with your resources
&gt; ~10% was a description of the formats.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you let MoST constrain your system around its formats, you would 
&gt; have achieved a 1000% productivity increase.

Ok, so give an example.. I have to admit that i don't really understand.
You have to define a format that is suitable for any kind of
application. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the
representation to be self descriptive, but you still have to define (ou
refine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as 
Bill? said).

&gt; 
&gt; HOW do you know that /inbox/ actually is a container containing MIME 
&gt; messages?

it's a one-line-doc matter...  :), or application/x-container, and no
need for doc!

&gt; Also, what does it mean actually to be a container?  FIFO? LIFO? by 
&gt; from-address...?  How does the shape of the container relate to your index 
&gt; format for representing it?

why does the client have to care about that ???

&gt; MoST provides enough constraints so that knowing *ONLY* your index format, 
&gt; a client can deliver mail.

Here, i don't have to anything about the index format to deliver mail. I
have to know about it to retrieve mails. To deliver, all i have to know
is that /inbox/ accepts mime as the Content-Type of a POST, which can be
stated in an OPTION response (not sure) .

&gt;   The client does not need to know *anything* 
&gt; about how the server thinks about inboxes internally.

Why does it need it in the proposed example ?

&gt;  Your inbox format caused me to assume you 
&gt; intended something similar.  It implies that mail delivery is simply adding 
&gt; an entry to an index and letting the client be responsible for storing the 
&gt; message at some URI.

no. 

&gt; However, if you want mail storage to be the recipient's responsibility, and 
&gt; you want messages in MIME format, you should use a format for your inbox 
&gt; that supports appending MIME messages e.g. mbox or multipart/digest.

agin, no. 

the index is a *representation* of the container. e.g.

c: 
GET /inbox/

s:
200 ok
aaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid
bbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid

c:
GET /inbox/aaa-mid

s:
200 ok
MIME version: 1.0
...

c:
POST /inbox/
Content-Type: mime/rfc-822

MIME ...
Subject: ccc
Message-ID: ccc-mid
...

s:
201 created
Location: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid

c:
GET /inbox/

s:
200 
ok

aaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid
bbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid
ccc: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid



but this example is juste quickly imagined to be an example, and must
not be considered as a proposal, nor as an complete and robust system.
there is surely problems in it :)
but it is concrete. Can't you give a concrete example of MoST model ?

The web-calculus provides exactly this functionality. Given an
understanding of the web-calculus, the only application
information that needs to be communicated is the structure of the
application web.

For example, the web-calculus specification uses an electronic
currency for its examples. This electronic currency application
interface is completely defined by the set of schemas that define
the structure of a currency exchange web. These schemas are
available at:

http://waterken.com/iou/

The productivity leverage comes from everyone working to a common,
simple and well-defined model. Before even starting an
application, everyone knows what the basic interactions will be.
The only difference between two applications is the shape of the
application graph. The shape of the application graph is precisely
defined by the schemas.

It doesn't seem like the server should attempt to interpret the client

it seems like 206 is inappropriate for this.

|     a.) A reference in the XML Content like &lt;resources

| 
|         Content-Range: resources start-end / total
| 
|     d.) Both? A link in the XML Content and information in the header?

Content-Range isn't right.  Location headers have a different purpose.
(a) seems more like the right thing....

We've done this by exposing the ranging by paramaterizing the URI, and
including details of the full response-space in the response itself.

GET /sqlrest/customer?count=0&amp;offset=0
&lt;resources size="60000" /&gt;

GET /sqlrest/customer?count=5&amp;offset=0
&lt;resources size="60000"&gt;
  &lt;resource href="/sqlrest/customer/0"&gt;0&lt;/resource&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;resource href="/sqlrest/customer/5"&gt;5&lt;/resource&gt;
  &lt;!-- See NOTE1 --&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;

NOTE1:

On the theory that we're transfering hypertext media around, it seems
like something else could come back here... some description of how to
get the rest of the content.... maybe something like...

&lt;resources href="/sqlrest/customer"&gt;
  &lt;param name="count" val="5" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="offset" val="5" /&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;

We've though about this a bit in our project, but we've just decided to
punt and make it an implicit part of the particular resource-space being
gotten ...


| 3.) Only the type "bytes" are mentioned in the HTTP specification. Can I use
| a own type like resources or are there any proposals for REST?

No ... HTTP is dealing with something else WRT content-range and byte-ranges,
not application-level content chunking.

| 4.) Are there a more REST like approach?

I think what I outlined above is, but I'd like to hear other options.


Another related issue we've run into is the reference vs. "expanded"
sub-resource.  Some container resources have many sub-elements, and the
application wants to get a particular sub-range.

GET /container
&lt;container&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/1" /&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/2" /&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/127000" /&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;

Since the application is only going to turn around and ask for expanded
versions for some window it's currently processing, we've taken to
expanding a sub-range:

GET /container?expand=true&amp;count=2&amp;offset=0
&lt;container&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- elt data populated --&gt;
  &lt;/elt&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/2"&gt;
    &lt;!-- elt data populated --&gt;
  &lt;/elt&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/3"/&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/4"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;elt href="/container/127000" /&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;


It turns out that xfering the rest of those elt-references is quite
prohibitive, especially over the WAN.  Especially since they're just
being ignored by the client, anyways.  I'd encourage you not to make
the same mistake.  Oh, and _always_ return something useful enough for
the caller ...

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Jot, RNA and ReST vs MoST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Ok.  I just read the HTTP spec a bit more carefully and I am going to 
change my position on this issue somewhat.  HTTP implies MoST even if ReST, 
perhaps, does not.  If you using HTTP and NOT using MoST architecture, you 
are violating the RFC2616, the HTTP specification!

"""
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the 
supplied Request-URI.
"""
[Hyptertext Transfer Protocol --- HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)]

What does it mean to respond OK to a request that the "enclosed entity be 
stored"?  RFC2616 does not say that a "representation" of the enclosed 
entity is stored, but that the entity itself is stored.  I interpret this 
to mean that if I can PUT an entity with a particular content-type at a 
particular URI, I can GET back that entity with that same content-type at 
that URI.  (The alternative is to say that a server may operate 
destructively with respect to a PUT entity body which seems wrong)

"""
The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an 
entity) is identified by the Request-URI.
[...]
The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types 
which are acceptable for the response.
[...]
If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the client 
accepts all media types.
"""
[RFC2616]

So when a client sends a GET, it expects the information identified by the 
resource.  If "whatever information" means ALL information without data 
loss, the client can reasonably interpret the response to a GET to *BE* the 
server's representation.  (Obviously when the client sends an Accept 
header, it accepting non-fidelity to the server's actual representation, 
but that is really beside the point here.  GET without an Accept header 
implies fidelity).

"""
The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity 
enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by 
the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
"""
[RFC2616]

Since the semantics of POST depend on the definition of "subordinate" 
resource and the definition of "subordinate" resource is dependent on the 
content-type of the server's representation of the resource, we can now say 
that the semantics of POST depends ENTIRELY on the content-type of the 
resource as determined by GET.

--On Friday, August 08, 2003 4:25 PM -0700 "Roy T. Fielding"
&gt; IF the server
&gt; allows a resource to be negotiable in terms of representations, then the
&gt; resource (that abstract concept mapping) is independent of the bits.

To be more specific, IF the request is in response to a GET with an Accept 
header, the bits  of the returned entity may be arbitrarily far from the 
bits of the resource itself.  HOWEVER, if the GET comes *without* an Accept 
header, the server MUST send the resource itself.  In other words, NO 
hidden representation.

&gt; The
&gt; problem is the way you view a resource -- if you constrain the notion of
&gt; a resource to being a stored representation, then you simply eliminate
&gt; the freedom of the server to choose whether the resource is going to
&gt; be negotiable in bit format.  There are good things and bad things
&gt; about such a model, but it certainly isn't necessary.  The Web works
&gt; fine without such a constraint.

MoST does not prohibit the server from handling Accept headers.  It just 
prohibits the server from sending random bits in response to a GET request 
*without* an Accept header.  If the server wants to handle Accept headers, 
GREAT, but that is really beside the point in this discussion.

&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that Yannick is doing nothing that contravenes any
&gt;&gt; spec.

I was wrong about this.  Reading the spec more carefully Yannick's app IS 
in violation of HTTP (details in other thread)

&gt; HTTP needs to be flexible to support gateways and legacy
&gt; systems for which the semantics you are demanding simply do not apply.

Unless you can give me a case where the MoST interpretation of HTTP cannot 
be used to support an application that you think it supports under your 
interpretation, this assertion is unfounded!

MoST architectural style means that you don't need hidden information to 
interact with an HTTP server.

If we take HTTP seriously by follow the requirements of MoST architectural 
style, we get more interoperability and transparency, higher productivity, 
and more happiness :- ).

See my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.
Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough to 
define your entire application from the client's perspective.

If the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept 
header, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the 
semantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a 
container.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST means 
add an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container; messages 
must be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.

If the server returns a container in response to a GET without an Accept 
header, the resource is a container and not an index.  That means the 
semantics of POST should be with respect to the container and not an index. 
In other words, if the resource is a container, then POST means add a 
message to the container and can at your option affect an index.  Messages 
are stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing constrains the 
server from providing an index in response to a GET with a an "Accept: 
text/x-yannick-index", but that is really beside the point.

Note, nothing constrains how the server actually stores the index or the 
container.  All that is required is that clients can interact solely in 
terms of the representations it exposes.

&gt;&gt; HOW do you know that /inbox/ actually is a container containing MIME
&gt;&gt; messages?
&gt;
&gt; it's a one-line-doc matter...  :), or application/x-container, and no
&gt; need for doc!

If the content-type returned from a GET without an Accept header is indeed 
an application/x-container
then how does the client obtain an index?  If it gets an index only when it 
sends the appropriate Accept header, then I have no issue with your app.

&gt;&gt;   The client does not need to know *anything*
&gt;&gt; about how the server thinks about inboxes internally.
&gt;
&gt; Why does it need it in the proposed example ?

It does if GET w/o an Accept header does not imply the required semantics 
w/r/t POST.

&gt; the index is a *representation* of the container. e.g.

It depends what you mean by representation.
0 is a representation of all integers after a suitable transformation.
What is the content-type returned from a GET without an Accept header?
What information is that content-type intended to represent?

&gt; c:
&gt; GET /inbox/
&gt;
&gt; s:
&gt; 200 ok
&gt; aaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid
&gt; bbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid

So /inbox/ is an index.  Appending an entry to this index is very different 
from appending a message to an inbox.

&gt; c:
&gt; POST /inbox/
&gt; Content-Type: mime/rfc-822
&gt;
&gt; MIME ...
&gt; Subject: ccc
&gt; Message-ID: ccc-mid
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; s:
&gt; 201 created
&gt; Location: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid

You CAN support this, but it is not HTTP because it is not meaningful to 
append a MIME message to an
index (because the index does not contain message data).

You needs to support this:
c:
POST /inbox/
Content-type: text/index-entry

ccc: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid

If this is not legal, you are not really supporting HTTP.

&gt; but this example is juste quickly imagined to be an example, and must
&gt; not be considered as a proposal, nor as an complete and robust system.
&gt; there is surely problems in it :)
&gt; but it is concrete. Can't you give a concrete example of MoST model ?

&gt; header, the resource is a container and not an index.  That means the
&gt; semantics of POST should be with respect to the container and not an
index.
&gt; In other words, if the resource is a container, then POST means add a
&gt; message to the container and can at your option affect an index.  Messages
&gt; are stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing constrains the
&gt; server from providing an index in response to a GET with a an "Accept:
&gt; text/x-yannick-index", but that is really beside the point.

If I understand correctly, the idea is that if a resource is labeled as a
"container" (where "container" has mutually agreed upon semantics), then a
client absolutely knows how and when each of the HTTP methods can be used on
that resource.  And what happens when you don't want to provide all
capabilities of a container?  For instances, what if the only function you
want to support is POST of a message and the only successful response is
202?  Once posted, there is no way to GET, PUT, DELETE, etc the message (via
that URI, anyhow).  It seems to me you would have to define the container
with restrictions or define a entirely new model ("drop box"?).  But then
what if the next time, you need something similar that provides only POST
and GET, except that also the expected response for the POST is either 201
or 302?

Let's take another look at RNA...

The interface is split into two URI types:  Identity and Inbox.  In either
case, the "client" (likely a remote server) may only POST an xml-based RNA
document.  In the case of the Identity URI, there is a simple rule that says
"if recipient likes the request entity, it will return a 200 with a similar
response entity, possibly adding or setting elements; otherwise, it will
reject the request appropriately."  In the case of the Inbox URI, there is a
simple rule that says "if recipient likes the request entity, it will return
a 202 (no response entity);  otherwise, it will reject the request
appropriately."  The Identity and Inbox URI have different criteria and
therefore do not necessarily return all of the same possible 4xx responses.
Now, as it happens to be that the Identity URI is highly visible, it also
defines the use of the GET method, which has absolutely no rules on how it
is implemented (beyond the semantics of a GET).  This is because people tend
to plug highly visible URIs into their web browsers and expect to get
something understandable back.  The Inbox URI, on the other hand, is
relatively hidden from the general user and therefore does not have the GET
method defined.

So, how can this be modeled in a way that would replace the need for
documentation?  What are the data models of the two URI types?  What allows
the client to know the valid range of RNA documents (in this case,
xml-based) that can be sent in the request entity, and in the case of the
Identity URI, returned in the response entity?  What if RNA were rewritten
to use ONX or YAML or some entirely proprietary format?  What allows the
clients to know what each of the possible 2xx, 3xx, and 4xx response codes
mean in context to the request such that it may correct its problem and try
again?

If you know how to model all of this in a clear, simple manner that doesn't
tie RNA's hands in any way, I'm all for it.  But what I feel you are
proposing is either too limiting or is too complicated.  Heck, I've got the
entire English language to write the spec with and I'm *still* not entirely
comfortable with the wording.

The wording in HTTP is "subordinate resource". Why can't a message
resource
be "subordinate" to an index resource? That's how directories work,
right?
If I GET a directory, I expect a hyperlinked list of its contents, not
all

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; We've done this by exposing the ranging by paramaterizing the URI, and
&gt; including details of the full response-space in the response itself.

  Yes, that's how millions of web apps like Google etc. handle large lists.
By default (w/o the list-management query params) they just send back the
first ten or so items, then later send subsequent list chunks as the client
requests them.


&gt; &lt;resources href="/sqlrest/customer"&gt;
&gt;   &lt;param name="count" val="5" /&gt;
&gt;   &lt;param name="offset" val="5" /&gt;
&gt; &lt;/resources&gt;

  That's cool and more flexible for a sophisticated client, but for many
apps it's easier just to include a link to the previous and next chunks; for
example:

&lt;resources rel="next" href="/sqlrest/customer?offset=5&amp;count=5" /&gt;

And while urls that make sense and are guessable are really
developer-friendly and we need more of them, it's absolutely best web
practice to send a description for producing the next, prev, and other
related urls (if not the urls themselves) with every page, just as you do
for the urls that identify contained resources. It's self-descriptive, which
is an explicit rest interface constraint (see
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5
_1_5), it enables clients to treat urls opaquely (see
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque), and it furthers your
app's web of linked resources, harnessing the awesome power of the world
wide web.

Nothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources.  You can 
PUT a message somewhere else and then updating the index.  You can add an 
entry to the index for a URL that does not currently resolve.  In contrast, 
the only way to add a message to a container is...to add a message to a 
container, making the message subordinate to the container.  Indexes don't 
imply subordination.  Containership does.

&gt; That's how directories work, right?
&gt; If I GET a directory, I expect a hyperlinked list of its contents, not all
&gt; the contents together in an archive.

Since HTTP URLs are hierarchical, an enumeration of all subordinate URLs is 
sufficient to communicate "whatever information" the directory URI 
designates.

Notably, because indexes don't themselves imply subordination of indexed 
resources, you can't take an index to imply that you add a file to a 
directory by POSTing to it.  To get an entry to appear in the index, you 
must put a corresponding file in the directory.

So you can view my objection to POSTing to Yannicks message indexes as 
equivalent to objecting to POSTing to directory URLs.  The semantics just 
aren't there to do it.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] ReST vs MoST Messaging<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Seairth,

MoST is just about taking HTTP seriously.  If the resource does not allow a 
particular method, give an error.

Re RNA (&lt;http://www.seairth.com/web/rna/&gt;):

&gt; The interface is split into two URI types:  Identity and Inbox.

Bad premise.  HTTP URIs designate RESOURCES that have *content-types*. 
URIs themselves do not have types.  This bad URL-type premise means you 
start by defining a special content-type for POST rather than a 
content-type for an inbox.  Having no inbox type means having no standard 
way to check your mail.  To me, this seems like a major failure in a 
"notification" protocol.  Your spec then becomes documentation of various 
interaction protocols that I find lengthy, arbitrary, and hard to follow 
(sorry).

Rather than a 15 page specification, how about one sentence:

 Map email addresses to HTTP by delivering to http://user@...

Given the constraints imposed by taking HTTP seriously, a little knowledge 
of existing content-types, and a little common sense, this one sentence is 
all you need to specify a system that does everything I believe RNA does. 
Simply tell users:

 Your inbox is located at http://user@...

Users can GET their inbox URLs and discover they have content-type: 
multipart/digest (RFC1521).  They can then build/install a simple 
HTTP&lt;-&gt;POP proxy and to read their mail using their favorite POP clients. 
When they reply to messages, their mail delivery agents can attempt to POST 
to the delivery URL of the sender before attempting SMTP delivery.  (The 
delivery URL of the sender is defined by the one sentence spec).

Before they POST to this URI, they do a HEAD to discover the content-type 
they may POST.  When they discover the content-type is multipart/digest, 
they know they can POST message/rfc822.  When they attempt to POST a 
message/rfc822 but get a "413 Request Entity Too Large" (because the 
recipient requires that mail storage be the sender's responsibility), they 
PUT their message body to some URI they control and then re-POST using an 
RFC2017 URL external-body content-type.  The server responds 201 CREATED 
with a Location header.  If they later decide they want to cancel that 
message, they can try to DELETE the url provided in that Location header. 
If they get a 200, they know their DELETE is successful.  If they get a 
403, they know they are going to have to explain the message they sent in a 
fit of rage.

General Comments:
* The above system is defined ENTIRELY by the relevant content-types.  Any 
ambiguities are the result of ambiguities in the content-types and not 
ambiguities in how to use HTTP.  If you wanted to be more careful, you 
might define a multipart/external-body content-type that  allows only parts 
that are message/rfc822 with URL external-body content-type.  Note that 
having done so, you would still be COMPLETELY SILENT about HTTP methods as 
they would be determined entirely by your container type..

* There is no explicitly documented standard for associating a URL with a 
MIME-part.  You could specify one.  However, given the constraint of 
RFC2616 and digest format, I think the *obvious* standard is simply to give 
each part a Location: header.  I think this is so obvious that I am not 
sure it worth documenting.  But feel free.

* The above was so short because there are already MIME container types 
that do more-or-less what you want.  Some applications may require you do 
define new content-types and content-types for containers of those types 
but any discussion of using HTTP with those types would be tutorial rather 
than specification.

* I am not aware of a standard XML container type.  There used to be work 
on XML "groves" but I don't know where that went.  So implementing the 
above with XML types actually requires a lot more content-type 
documentation work.  Given the installed base of messaging applications 
that use MIME, I'm also not sure it is worth bothering.

HTTP completely specifies the meaning of HTTP methods with respect to HTTP

Neither MoST nor HTTP says anything about the behavior of agents that

&gt; with a container.  See the definition of POST in rfc2616.  

"""
The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity
is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate
to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a
newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
database.
"""

I don't see where this imply MoST... your proposed is based on Mime, not
HTTP, to imply how to interact with the resource...


&gt; &gt; These are application level specificities, while Rest is
&gt; &gt; communication/interaction level.
&gt; 
&gt; MoST addresses the same level as ReST.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can define a common way to express
&gt; &gt; rules and restrictions of your application, as you can define a generic
&gt; &gt; container "super-type", with the corresponding behaviours, but I thing
&gt; &gt; that is out of the scope of ReST...
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP completely specifies the meaning of HTTP methods with respect to HTTP 
&gt; resources.  If you are defining different meanings for these methods you 
&gt; are violating HTTP.  MoST is just the observation that HTTP is good. 
&gt; Neither MoST nor HTTP says anything about the behavior of agents that 
&gt; interact with those resources.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; See my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough
&gt; &gt;&gt; to  define your entire application from the client's perspective.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept
&gt; &gt;&gt; header, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the
&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a
&gt; &gt;&gt; container.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST means
&gt; &gt;&gt; add an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container; messages
&gt; &gt;&gt; must be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns a container in response to a GET without an Accept

&gt; &gt;&gt; Messages  are stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing
&gt; &gt;&gt; constrains the  server from providing an index in response to a GET with

&gt; Nothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources. You
can

an

Okay, you're using "container" as distinct from, say, "collection" in
WebDAV.

&gt; &gt; That's how directories work, right?  If I GET a directory, I expect
a
&gt; &gt; hyperlinked list of its contents, not all the contents together in
an
&gt; &gt; archive.
&gt;
&gt; Since HTTP URLs are hierarchical, an enumeration of all subordinate
URLs
&gt; is sufficient to communicate "whatever information" the directory URI
&gt; designates.
&gt;
&gt; Notably, because indexes don't themselves imply subordination of
indexed
&gt; resources, you can't take an index to imply that you add a file to a
&gt; directory by POSTing to it. To get an entry to appear in the index,
you
&gt; must put a corresponding file in the directory.
&gt;
&gt; So you can view my objection to POSTing to Yannicks message indexes as
&gt; equivalent to objecting to POSTing to directory URLs. The semantics
just
&gt; aren't there to do it.

HTTP still leaves POST pretty open. As Yannick just quoted, RFC 2616
says,
"The posted entity is subordinate to that URI in the same way that *a
file
is subordinate to a directory containing it*, a news article is
subordinate
to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a

POSTing
a file to a directory.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] ReST vs MoST Messaging<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>From: "Alex Jacobson" &lt;alex@...&gt;

&gt; MoST is just about taking HTTP seriously.  If the resource does not allow
a
&gt; particular method, give an error.

But if a client only knows a given resource is a "container", it won't know
that a given method is not allowed until the method is actually tried.  I
certainly wouldn't want to design a client with expectations that are not
necessarily true.

&gt; Re RNA (&lt;http://www.seairth.com/web/rna/&gt;):
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The interface is split into two URI types:  Identity and Inbox.
&gt;
&gt; Bad premise.  HTTP URIs designate RESOURCES that have *content-types*.
&gt; URIs themselves do not have types.  This bad URL-type premise means you
&gt; start by defining a special content-type for POST rather than a
&gt; content-type for an inbox.  Having no inbox type means having no standard
&gt; way to check your mail.  To me, this seems like a major failure in a
&gt; "notification" protocol.  Your spec then becomes documentation of various
&gt; interaction protocols that I find lengthy, arbitrary, and hard to follow
&gt; (sorry).

Fair enough.  I know the spec needs some work.  From the comments you make
below, I feel you do not understand what RNA is (which I am willing to admit
may entirely have to do with the documentation).  A few thing I would like
to point out before continuing is that RNA is *not* a mail protocol and
"Inbox" does *not* mean a mail inbox.  Viewing RNA in this manner would
definitely cause the misunderstanding you seem to have.

Having said that, let's try another approach.  It may even be that this is
the sort of modeling you are talking about.  I'm making this up as I go, so
bear with me...

1. resources: Identity, Inbox
2. content-types: application/x.rna.agreement+xml,
application/x.rna.notification+xml
3. map(Identity): POST application/x.rna.agreement+xml =&gt;
200(application/x.rna.agreement+xml), GET =&gt; (200(*/*), 302())
4. map(Inbox): POST application/x.rna.notification+xml =&gt; 202()


Here is how the above rules are read:

1. Two resources are involved: an Identity resource and an Inbox resource.
In order to write a client, the programmer will have to understand what
these resources are.  This understanding comes from documentation that
describes them.

2. Two content-types are involved: application/x.rna.agreement+xml and
application/x.rna.notification+xml [1].  As with the resources, the
programmer must understand the content-types to write the client.  Here,
however, it would at least be possible to plug in existing code (written by
another programmer).

3. An Identity resource allows two methods: POST and GET.  For POST, the
request entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.agreement+xml.  The
possible response [2] to a POST is 200, where the only returnable
content-type is also application/x.rna.agreement+xml.  For GET, the possible
responses can be 200, where the returnable content-type can be anything, and
302, where no response entity is given.

4. An Inbox resource allows one method: POST.  For POST, the request
entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.notification+xml.  The
possible response to a POST is 202, where no response entity is given.

Notes:
[1] Currently, the RNA spec only has one content-type:
application/x.rna+xml.  However, the above process has made me realize that
I really had two different content types that need to be defined.  On the
other hand, I suppose I could also just use application/xml with XML
Namespaces to differentiate the two document types internally.  That doesn't
really seem like a good approach, but I have to admit I am a bit gun shy
when it comes to XMLNS.
[2] 4xx and 5xx responses are alway implicitly supported, but can be
explicitly named above if special criteria need to be given (such as a
specific returnable content-type).


Now, as I said above, it is still up to the programmer to understand what
the resources and the content-types mean.  The above rules don't come
anywhere close to explaining what RNA actually is.  But I have to admit that
they do make it much easier to see how the pieces fit together, even if you
don't understand what the pieces are.  I think I will try to draft a rework
of the RNA documentation in this manner and see if it makes things easier to
understand and implement.  However, for the moment, I will give a quick
synopsis of each of those bits:

Identity Resource
This resource represents a user's (person, program, machine, etc.) identity.
Currently, it has only two functions:  negotiate RNA Agreement documents
(content-type of application/x.rna.agreement+xml), and to return something
(such as an html document) what queried. Upon successful negotiation of an
RNA Agreement document, the client has either been given access to an Inbox
Resource, or has been given validation of the current RNA Agreement.

Inbox Resource
This resource represents an endpoint that collects notifications.
Currently, it has only one function: accept RNA Notification documents
(content-type of application/x.rna.notification+xml).

application/x.rna.agreement+xml content-type
This content-type is an xml-based document used for negotiating access to
Inbox Resources.  This content-type has a set of rules governing what is
valid based on whether the document is being sent (as request entity) or
returned (as response entity).

application/x.rna.notification+xml content-type
This content-type is an xml-based document used to notify someone (or
something) about another resource.  This content-type has a limited set of
rules and format that must be conformed to.


Additional Note(s):  The RNA specification does not define any method for a
user to retrieve notifications sent to him.  It also does not define any
other configuration, validation, etc criteria.  RNA only defines the
"public" server interface.  It is expected that servers will act as clients
when using RNA between each other (as opposed to having a dedicated client
program).  I am currently working on a set of "private" server interfaces
that allows a user to view received notifications, define agreement
negotiation criteria, send notifications, etc.  This specification is being
kept separate from RNA on purpose.  This allows other to define their own
specifications for dealing with the back-end stuff as is appropriate for
their own uses of RNA.  For instance, one such set of interfaces may be used
to implement a mail-like usage of RNA.  Another such set of interfaces may
be used to implement a peer file-sharing network.  Yet another may be used
to implement an "instant messaging" function.


So, there we are... does this clear anything up about RNA?  Also, does any
of the above stuff look like what you want to do with MoST?  Well, until
tomorrow...

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] ReST vs MoST Messaging<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

Alex's explanation of subordination and containment below
heightens for me the need for distinction between resource and
representation in the web lexicon.

Alex gives two examples.  In one, you POST an entry to an
index, which updates the index without necessarily changing the
resource which it indexes.  In the other, you POST a message
to a container, making the message subordinate to (and contained
within) the container.

If the index above indexes the container above, it is likely that
that latter operation affects both resources (the index and the
container), as evidenced by later GETs.

The problem here is an ambiguity between a representation of
the container and the index resource itself.  Let me clarify.  If there
was only one URI in the system and it identified the container
and you did a GET on it, it might be reasonable to call the served-
up representation an "index" or "directory" of the container.

Still assuming only that one URI, there is no defined operation
for POSTing to the index, because the index is a representation,
not a resource.  So although the resource is represented as an index,
you would still be POSTing to a container.

You can identify a resource which behaves as an index for the
designated container, and you could allow it to proxy for the
container, handling POSTS as if it were the container itself, if you
want to.  This would be legal HTTP, because HTTP also allows
resources to simply act as data processors, unconstrained by
notions of subordination, annotation and extension.

But I think I've drifted off the subject.  The main point is not to
confuse the container resource's representation (an index) with
some other resource (an index) which may not be implemented,
or which may be implemented with a semantics other than the
proxy one I mentioned above.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt;&gt; MoST is just about taking HTTP seriously.  If the resource does not 
allow a
&gt;&gt; particular method, give an error.
&gt;
&gt; But if a client only knows a given resource is a "container", it won't
&gt; know that a given method is not allowed until the method is actually
&gt; tried. I certainly wouldn't want to design a client with expectations
&gt; that are not necessarily true.

Nothing about ReST or MoST or HTTP prevents a server from requiring valid 
authentication tokens in GET request.  You can discover that authentication 
is required simply by receiving a 401.  More generally, why have all of 
these status codes if the client should simply know not to violate the 
constraints they describe from some out-of-band documentation.

What is at issue here is how much you can discover WITHOUT out-of-band 
documentation of the particular resource.  Per resource documentation means 
you no longer have a generic/visible/transparent API.

MoST says that HTTP provides enough constraints so that the only 
out-of-band documentation needed is the content-type definitions.

A useful rule:
If you would be better off defining a new HTTP method than using an 
existing one, you are not really using HTTP.  You would be better off using 
a new HTTP method if it is the only way to tell whether or not your 
resource has the functionality you are prescribing.  In other words, a 
resource that doesn't implement your method returns a 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED 
status.

&gt; RNA is *not* a mail
&gt; protocol and "Inbox" does *not* mean a mail inbox.  Viewing RNA in this
&gt; manner would definitely cause the misunderstanding you seem to have.

OK, what is the purpose of RNA?

&gt; Having said that, let's try another approach.  It may even be that this is
&gt; the sort of modeling you are talking about.  I'm making this up as I go,
&gt; so bear with me...
&gt;
&gt; 1. resources: Identity, Inbox
&gt; 2. content-types: application/x.rna.agreement+xml,
&gt; application/x.rna.notification+xml
&gt; 3. map(Identity): POST application/x.rna.agreement+xml =&gt;
&gt; 200(application/x.rna.agreement+xml), GET =&gt; (200(*/*), 302())
&gt; 4. map(Inbox): POST application/x.rna.notification+xml =&gt; 202()

Nope.  You still don't have a content-type for identity or inbox.

&gt; 1. Two resources are involved: an Identity resource and an Inbox resource.
&gt; In order to write a client, the programmer will have to understand what
&gt; these resources are.  This understanding comes from documentation that
&gt; describes them.

But since you don't provide content-type for the resources, the programmer 
has no way to understand what they are.

Instead you are providing documentation that describes how they respond to 
various HTTP method names.  The programmer still has no idea what they 
*are*.

What they *are* constrains how they interact via HTTP.  Defining a custom 
interface via HTTP is defining a custom interface and loses all the 
advantages of genericity/visibility/transparency etc.  It is NOT 
discoverable.
Given the arbitrariness of your interface, why not define a new HTTP method?

&gt; 2. Two content-types are involved: application/x.rna.agreement+xml and
&gt; application/x.rna.notification+xml [1].  As with the resources, the
&gt; programmer must understand the content-types to write the client.  Here,
&gt; however, it would at least be possible to plug in existing code (written
&gt; by another programmer).

NOTHING motivates these content-types unless you specify the content-type 
of the resource itself.  They are completely arbitrary.  Why not just 
define a new HTTP method that requires these content-types?  Then, at 
least, you would know whether the resource supports it.

&gt; 3. An Identity resource allows two methods: POST and GET.  For POST, the
&gt; request entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.agreement+xml.
&gt; The possible response [2] to a POST is 200, where the only returnable
&gt; content-type is also application/x.rna.agreement+xml.  For GET, the
&gt; possible responses can be 200, where the returnable content-type can be
&gt; anything, and 302, where no response entity is given.

If the returned content-type is undefined, you are violating HTTP and 
describing NOTHING.

&gt; 4. An Inbox resource allows one method: POST.  For POST, the request
&gt; entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.notification+xml.  The
&gt; possible response to a POST is 202, where no response entity is given.

202 implies ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the behavior of the system.  You are 
describing entirely arbitrary interfaces.  Why not define a new method?

A resource that accepts POSTs of ANY content-type and returns random 
content in response to a GET implements RNA.  What is the point?
At least if you created a new method, the fact that RNA is supported would 
be visible.

&gt; Notes:
&gt; [1] Currently, the RNA spec only has one content-type:
&gt; application/x.rna+xml.  However, the above process has made me realize
&gt; that I really had two different content types that need to be defined.
&gt; On the other hand, I suppose I could also just use application/xml with
&gt; XML Namespaces to differentiate the two document types internally.  That
&gt; doesn't really seem like a good approach, but I have to admit I am a bit
&gt; gun shy when it comes to XMLNS.

It really helps HTTP to pass as specific a content-type as possible in the 
header.  Use the text/xml+format convention if you can.

&gt; [2] 4xx and 5xx responses are alway implicitly supported, but can be
&gt; explicitly named above if special criteria need to be given (such as a
&gt; specific returnable content-type).

Your spec says that an RNA inbox accepts any POST of the content-type you 
specify.  Stuff that is not that content-type is not covered by your spec.
Again, your spec defines ABSOLUTELY NO visible behavior by an HTTP server.

&gt; Identity Resource
&gt; This resource represents a user's (person, program, machine, etc.)
&gt; identity. Currently, it has only two functions:  negotiate RNA Agreement
&gt; documents (content-type of application/x.rna.agreement+xml), and to
&gt; return something (such as an html document) what queried. Upon successful
&gt; negotiation of an RNA Agreement document, the client has either been
&gt; given access to an Inbox Resource, or has been given validation of the
&gt; current RNA Agreement.

If resources have "functions" you are implementing a custom interface.  Why 
not give these functions explicit method names?

&gt; Inbox Resource
&gt; This resource represents an endpoint that collects notifications.
&gt; Currently, it has only one function: accept RNA Notification documents
&gt; (content-type of application/x.rna.notification+xml).

See above re functions.

&gt; Additional Note(s):  The RNA specification does not define any method for
&gt; a user to retrieve notifications sent to him.  It also does not define any
&gt; other configuration, validation, etc criteria.  RNA only defines the
&gt; "public" server interface.

Fine.  Why not define custom method names for this interface so at least 
the client can know that the server actually claims to implement this 
interface?

&gt; It is expected that servers will act as
&gt; clients when using RNA between each other (as opposed to having a
&gt; dedicated client program).  I am currently working on a set of "private"
&gt; server interfaces that allows a user to view received notifications,
&gt; define agreement negotiation criteria, send notifications, etc.  This
&gt; specification is being kept separate from RNA on purpose.  This allows
&gt; other to define their own specifications for dealing with the back-end

&gt; Another such set of interfaces may be used to implement a peer
&gt; file-sharing network.  Yet another may be used to implement an "instant

If you want to define customer interfaces, that is fine.  Its just not 
using HTTP.  Why not use IDL?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Yes, but that comes after:
"""
The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity 
enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource   identified 
by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
"""

So the actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the 
RESOURCE identified by they URI (not the URI itself).  Subordination only 
has meaning based on the content-type of that resource.

The paragraph you quote also adds the constraint that the URI returned in 
the Location header in a 201 also must be subordinate in URI space to the 
POSTed URI.  Obviously the server has to figure out how best to implement 
this subordination.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; See my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough to  define your entire application from the client's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; header, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; container.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means add an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; messages must be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns a container in response to a GET without an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Accept header, the resource is a container and not an index.  That
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means the semantics of POST should be with respect to the container
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not an index.  In other words, if the resource is a container,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; then POST means add a  message to the container and can at your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; option affect an index. Messages  are stored in the container  a la
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SMTP.  Note, nothing constrains the  server from providing an index
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in response to a GET with a an "Accept:  text/x-yannick-index", but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that is really beside the point.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>From: "Alex Jacobson" &lt;alex@...&gt;
&gt; &gt; RNA is *not* a mail
&gt; &gt; protocol and "Inbox" does *not* mean a mail inbox.  Viewing RNA in this
&gt; &gt; manner would definitely cause the misunderstanding you seem to have.
&gt;
&gt; OK, what is the purpose of RNA?

Its nothing more than a way for one party to notify another party of a
resource.

&gt; &gt; Having said that, let's try another approach.  It may even be that this
is
&gt; &gt; the sort of modeling you are talking about.  I'm making this up as I go,
&gt; &gt; so bear with me...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. resources: Identity, Inbox
&gt; &gt; 2. content-types: application/x.rna.agreement+xml,
&gt; &gt; application/x.rna.notification+xml
&gt; &gt; 3. map(Identity): POST application/x.rna.agreement+xml =&gt;
&gt; &gt; 200(application/x.rna.agreement+xml), GET =&gt; (200(*/*), 302())
&gt; &gt; 4. map(Inbox): POST application/x.rna.notification+xml =&gt; 202()
&gt;
&gt; Nope.  You still don't have a content-type for identity or inbox.

What are you talking about?  Resources dont have content-types!  Only the
representations of them do.  For instance, suppose you have a resource that
is an image of me.  Either through conneg or through different URIs, a GET
may return a jpg, gif, png, svg, bmp, wmf, pdf, mix, pcx, or even ascii art.
Each of those representations have a content-type.  The resource itself is
not any one of those content-types and should not be expressed as such.  It
*may* be that the actual bits on the server are stored as svg (and converted
for all other content-type representations), but that doesn't mean that a
client should think of the resource as being an svg resource.  That is an
implementation detail that has nothing to do with the client-server
relationship. Likewise, neither the Identity or Inbox resources should have
a content-type.

&gt; &gt; 1. Two resources are involved: an Identity resource and an Inbox
resource.
&gt; &gt; In order to write a client, the programmer will have to understand what
&gt; &gt; these resources are.  This understanding comes from documentation that
&gt; &gt; describes them.
&gt;
&gt; But since you don't provide content-type for the resources, the programmer
&gt; has no way to understand what they are.
&gt;
&gt; Instead you are providing documentation that describes how they respond to
&gt; various HTTP method names.  The programmer still has no idea what they
&gt; *are*.
&gt;
&gt; What they *are* constrains how they interact via HTTP.  Defining a custom
&gt; interface via HTTP is defining a custom interface and loses all the
&gt; advantages of genericity/visibility/transparency etc.  It is NOT
&gt; discoverable.
&gt; Given the arbitrariness of your interface, why not define a new HTTP
method?

All that needs knowing is what the resource does with the associated
content-type (3 and 4 above).  Beyond that, the client shouldn't care what
the resource is.

&gt; &gt; 2. Two content-types are involved: application/x.rna.agreement+xml and
&gt; &gt; application/x.rna.notification+xml [1].  As with the resources, the
&gt; &gt; programmer must understand the content-types to write the client.  Here,
&gt; &gt; however, it would at least be possible to plug in existing code (written
&gt; &gt; by another programmer).
&gt;
&gt; NOTHING motivates these content-types unless you specify the content-type
&gt; of the resource itself.  They are completely arbitrary.  Why not just
&gt; define a new HTTP method that requires these content-types?  Then, at
&gt; least, you would know whether the resource supports it.

Huh?

&gt; &gt; 3. An Identity resource allows two methods: POST and GET.  For POST, the
&gt; &gt; request entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.agreement+xml.
&gt; &gt; The possible response [2] to a POST is 200, where the only returnable
&gt; &gt; content-type is also application/x.rna.agreement+xml.  For GET, the
&gt; &gt; possible responses can be 200, where the returnable content-type can be
&gt; &gt; anything, and 302, where no response entity is given.
&gt;
&gt; If the returned content-type is undefined, you are violating HTTP and
&gt; describing NOTHING.

If you are talking about the bit concerning GET and the 200 response, I am
not saying it's undefined.  I am saying its the set of all possible
content-types.  But let's not get hung up on this detail.  It is only there
because most humans want to plug URIs into web browsers with the expectation
of getting something back.  Unlike URIs pointing to Inbox resource, URIs
pointing to Identity resources are highly visible.  Now, as we discuss this,
I do think this function is outside the scope of RNA, esp. given the
rewording in my prior post.  As I said, though, let's not get stuck on this
minor point.  It isn't central to RNA.

&gt; &gt; 4. An Inbox resource allows one method: POST.  For POST, the request
&gt; &gt; entity's content-type must be application/x.rna.notification+xml.  The
&gt; &gt; possible response to a POST is 202, where no response entity is given.
&gt;
&gt; 202 implies ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the behavior of the system.  You are
&gt; describing entirely arbitrary interfaces.  Why not define a new method?

Would you like 204 instead?  To me, 202 means "the request was valid and
there is nothing more to say".  If you know what
application/x.rna.notification+xml is and what its relationship to an Inbox
resource is, then I think it means all that it needs to mean.

&gt; A resource that accepts POSTs of ANY content-type and returns random
&gt; content in response to a GET implements RNA.  What is the point?
&gt; At least if you created a new method, the fact that RNA is supported would
&gt; be visible.

What?  Where did this come from?

&gt; &gt; Notes:
&gt; &gt; [2] 4xx and 5xx responses are alway implicitly supported, but can be
&gt; &gt; explicitly named above if special criteria need to be given (such as a
&gt; &gt; specific returnable content-type).
&gt;
&gt; Your spec says that an RNA inbox accepts any POST of the content-type you
&gt; specify.  Stuff that is not that content-type is not covered by your spec.
&gt; Again, your spec defines ABSOLUTELY NO visible behavior by an HTTP server.

Sorry, you've lost me here as well.  What do you mean by that last sentance?

&gt; &gt; Identity Resource
&gt; &gt; This resource represents a user's (person, program, machine, etc.)
&gt; &gt; identity. Currently, it has only two functions:  negotiate RNA Agreement
&gt; &gt; documents (content-type of application/x.rna.agreement+xml), and to
&gt; &gt; return something (such as an html document) what queried. Upon
successful
&gt; &gt; negotiation of an RNA Agreement document, the client has either been
&gt; &gt; given access to an Inbox Resource, or has been given validation of the
&gt; &gt; current RNA Agreement.
&gt;
&gt; If resources have "functions" you are implementing a custom interface.
Why
&gt; not give these functions explicit method names?

Because POST is sufficient.  I don't see that creating a new method would be
any more helpful.

&gt; &gt; It is expected that servers will act as
&gt; &gt; clients when using RNA between each other (as opposed to having a
&gt; &gt; dedicated client program).  I am currently working on a set of "private"
&gt; &gt; server interfaces that allows a user to view received notifications,
&gt; &gt; define agreement negotiation criteria, send notifications, etc.  This
&gt; &gt; specification is being kept separate from RNA on purpose.  This allows
&gt; &gt; other to define their own specifications for dealing with the back-end
&gt; &gt; stuff as is appropriate for their own uses of RNA.  For instance, one
&gt; &gt; such set of interfaces may be used to implement a mail-like usage of
RNA.
&gt; &gt; Another such set of interfaces may be used to implement a peer
&gt; &gt; file-sharing network.  Yet another may be used to implement an "instant
&gt; &gt; messaging" function.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to define customer interfaces, that is fine.  Its just not
&gt; using HTTP.  Why not use IDL?

I only mentioned this to make clear that this was not part of the RNA
specification. As with that bit above, let's not dwell on this, as it
doesn't directly have to do with the RNA specification and this
conversation.

How is that functionally different from a mail system that requires RFC2017 
URL external body content-types? In other words a mail system in which the 
body of the message is access via URL rather than included in the message 
itself.

Since my one line spec does exactly that.  Why do I need all the RNA docs?

&gt;&gt; Nope.  You still don't have a content-type for identity or inbox.
&gt;
&gt; What are you talking about?  Resources dont have content-types!  Only the

That is the subject of the current debate.  My claim is that POST requires 
that resources MUST have content-types and that those resource 
content-types MUST be exposed whenever a client make a GET requests without 
an Accept header.

How the server stores the resource is irrelevant.  The server must BEHAVE 
as if the content-type is whatever it says in response to a raw GET.

Did you read my last reply to Roy?  Have you read the actual text of 
RFC2616?

&gt; For instance, suppose you have a resource that is an image of me.

What does it mean for the resource to be an image of you?  You have a 
resource that is an image.  RFC2616 requires that the server behave as if 
the image is stored in whatever content-type it declares in response to a 
GET or HEAD request.

&gt; Either through conneg or through different URIs,
&gt; a GET may return a jpg, gif, png, svg, bmp, wmf, pdf, mix, pcx, or even
&gt; ascii art. Each of those representations have a content-type.  The
&gt; resource itself is not any one of those content-types and should not be

&gt; stored as svg (and converted for all other content-type representations),
&gt; but that doesn't mean that a client should think of the resource as being
&gt; an svg resource.

You are confusing conneg with raw GET.  The client *should* think of the 
resource as being a text/xml+svg resource IF that is the content-type the 
server supplies in response to a GET without an Accept header.

&gt; That is an implementation detail that has nothing to do
&gt; with the client-server relationship. Likewise, neither the Identity or
&gt; Inbox resources should have a content-type.

If they don't have a content-type, it is not really meaningfully to talk 
about POSTing to it because without a content-type you lack a notion of 
subordinate resources.

In what way is a notification subordnate to an Inbox or an Agreement 
subordinate to an Identity?  How can a client know that?

&gt;&gt; What they *are* constrains how they interact via HTTP.  Defining a custom
&gt;&gt; interface via HTTP is defining a custom interface and loses all the
&gt;&gt; advantages of genericity/visibility/transparency etc.  It is NOT
&gt;&gt; discoverable.
&gt;&gt; Given the arbitrariness of your interface, why not define a new HTTP
&gt; method?
&gt;
&gt; All that needs knowing is what the resource does with the associated
&gt; content-type (3 and 4 above).  Beyond that, the client shouldn't care what
&gt; the resource is.

How does the client know the content-type it is supposed to POST?  If you 
are restricting POST to an entirely arbitrary content-type and the effect 
of that POST is entirely invisible to the client and the notion of 
"subordinate resource" has no meaning, in what sense are you implementing 
HTTP POST.  You are defining a new method and should choose another name? 
At very least, if you did, the client would know whether the server is 
actually implementing RNA or just accepting POSTs of *any* random 
content-type.  The client would know this based on the NOT IMPLEMENTED 
status code.  Your protocol provides the client NO WAY to know what the 
server is actually doing (whether the resource actually even intends to 
implement an RNA interface).

&gt;&gt; If the returned content-type is undefined, you are violating HTTP and
&gt;&gt; describing NOTHING.
&gt;
&gt; As I said, though, let's not
&gt; get stuck on this minor point.  It isn't central to RNA.

The content-type of a resource is essential to HTTP.  Otherwise PUT, POST, 
and GET have no meaning.

&gt;&gt; 202 implies ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the behavior of the system.  You are
&gt;&gt; describing entirely arbitrary interfaces.  Why not define a new method?
&gt;
&gt; Would you like 204 instead?  To me, 202 means "the request was valid and
&gt; there is nothing more to say".  If you know what
&gt; application/x.rna.notification+xml is and what its relationship to an
&gt; Inbox resource is, then I think it means all that it needs to mean.

Unless Inbox has a content-type, I have NO way to know what its 
relationship is to ANYTHING.  All I know is that it accepts your 
content-type via a method you call POST (but that isn't the POST described 
by the HTTP spec).  Why not use another method name?  It would be less 
confusing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Notes:
&gt;&gt; &gt; [2] 4xx and 5xx responses are always implicitly supported, but can be
&gt;&gt; &gt; explicitly named above if special criteria need to be given (such as a
&gt;&gt; &gt; specific returnable content-type).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your spec says that an RNA inbox accepts any POST of the content-type you
&gt;&gt; specify.  Stuff that is not that content-type is not covered by your
&gt;&gt; spec. Again, your spec defines ABSOLUTELY NO visible behavior by an HTTP
&gt;&gt; server.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, you've lost me here as well.  What do you mean by that last
&gt; sentence?

Are you defining the behavior of the URI with respect to all possible 
POSTed content-types or only with respect to the content-types you define? 
If the former, you can't talk about 4xx or 5xx codes.  If the later, you 
are moving even further away from HTTP and are really just defining a new 
HTTP method.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Identity Resource
&gt;&gt; &gt; This resource represents a user's (person, program, machine, etc.)
&gt;&gt; &gt; identity. Currently, it has only two functions:  negotiate RNA
&gt;&gt; &gt; Agreement documents (content-type of application/x.rna.agreement+xml),

&gt;
&gt; Because POST is sufficient.  I don't see that creating a new method would
&gt; be any more helpful.

You are *already* creating a new method, the only question is whether you 
can or should call it POST.  Since the HTTP spec reserves the POST method 
name, to comply with HTTP, you must choose another name.

&gt; resource that is an image.  RFC2616 requires that the server behave as if
&gt; the image is stored in whatever content-type it declares in response to a
&gt; GET or HEAD request.

It does?  Where does it claim that?

&gt; &gt; Either through conneg or through different URIs,
&gt; &gt; a GET may return a jpg, gif, png, svg, bmp, wmf, pdf, mix, pcx, or even
&gt; &gt; ascii art. Each of those representations have a content-type.  The
&gt; &gt; resource itself is not any one of those content-types and should not be
&gt; &gt; expressed as such.  It *may* be that the actual bits on the server are
&gt; &gt; stored as svg (and converted for all other content-type
representations),
&gt; &gt; but that doesn't mean that a client should think of the resource as
being
&gt; &gt; an svg resource.
&gt;
&gt; You are confusing conneg with raw GET.  The client *should* think of the
&gt; resource as being a text/xml+svg resource IF that is the content-type the
&gt; server supplies in response to a GET without an Accept header.

If the client only knows about the text/xml+svg content-type, then that will
be its world-view of the resource regardless of what other representations
could be returned.  On the other hand, if the client knows both the
text/xml+svg and the image/gif content-types, and the resource can be
expressed as either, then I think it's foolish for the client to think that
the resource is just text/xml+svg.

&gt; &gt; That is an implementation detail that has nothing to do
&gt; &gt; with the client-server relationship. Likewise, neither the Identity or
&gt; &gt; Inbox resources should have a content-type.
&gt;
&gt; If they don't have a content-type, it is not really meaningfully to talk

&gt; subordinate resources.
&gt;

&gt; subordinate to an Identity?  How can a client know that?

What does this matter to the client?

&gt; &gt; Because POST is sufficient.  I don't see that creating a new method
would
&gt; &gt; be any more helpful.
&gt;
&gt; You are *already* creating a new method, the only question is whether you
&gt; can or should call it POST.  Since the HTTP spec reserves the POST method
&gt; name, to comply with HTTP, you must choose another name.

Hmm.. this seems to be the rub (or one of them, anyhow).  I think that RNA's
use of POST falls cleanly within the HTTP's intended use for POST.  You
don't.

&gt;
&gt; Obviously, you don't.  Go on doing things the way you are.  If you want to
&gt; have a conversation of REST and MoST, that's fine.  But I'd appreciate it
&gt; we can do it without telling me that RNA is pointless.

Since this is a debate about the merits of ReST vs MoST, your ReSTful 
Notification Architecture is exhibit A.

My goal in this discussion is actually to convince you that RNA as it 
stands IS pointless.  More generally, my goal is to show all the people who 
are defining "ReSTful interfaces" that what they are doing is unnecessary. 
That they just need content-types.  All of you are smart people and my hope 
is that you will put your efforts into more valuable tasks.

If you are interested in a notification mechanism for HTTP, what I, 
personally, would really like to see is a WATCH http method.

Create a watch resource for watchedURI
C: WATCH watchedURI
C: Location: watcherURI
S: 201 CREATED
S: Location: watchURI

See what URI is doing the watching
C: GET watchURI
S: 200 OK
S:
S: watcherURI

Change it
C: PUT watchURI
C:
C: newWatcherURI
S: 200 OK

Stop watching
C: DELETE watchURI
S: 200 OK

This method creates a watchResource that replicates the current state of 
watchedURI to watcherURI.  Things that need refinement:
* what latency should the watcher expect?
* what happens if the watcherURI is unreachable?
* can the watchURI simply PUT the current state of the watchedURI rather 
than transmitting all the intermediate POSTs?
* can we use eTags to prevent loops?

The value of this HTTP method would be to decouple server functionality 
from resource management.  You could then have standalone webservers whose 
job is to maintain the integrity of resources.  Anyone else can implement 
functionality associated with a resource change independent of the actual 
web server managing the resource.


&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nope.  You still don't have a content-type for identity or inbox.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; What are you talking about?  Resources dont have content-types!  Only
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; representations of them do.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is the subject of the current debate.  My claim is that POST
&gt;&gt; requires that resources MUST have content-types and that those resource
&gt;&gt; content-types MUST be exposed whenever a client make a GET requests
&gt; without
&gt;&gt; an Accept header.
&gt;
&gt; Well, this is where I disagree.

I've given lots of reasons to believe that resources have content-types.
Care to provide a reason why you don't?

&gt;&gt; How the server stores the resource is irrelevant.  The server must BEHAVE
&gt;&gt; as if the content-type is whatever it says in response to a raw GET.
&gt;
&gt; I do not see in the RFC where POST means anything about GET (or vice
&gt; versa) for the same resource.  Could you point it out for me?

I already did in my last reply to Roy.  Did you read it?
Here is the URL for your convenience:
&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3887&gt;

If a server accepts PUT, a subsequent GET of the resource MUST return the 
same data with the same content-type.  And again, RFC2616 says that POST 
means create a resource subordinate to resource designed by the POSTed URI. 
It make no sense to talk about subordinate resources if resource structure 
is hidden.  The way you expose resource structure in HTTP is via the 
content-type header.

Do you have an alternate interpretation of subordinate resource?

&gt;&gt; &gt; For instance, suppose you have a resource that is an image of me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What does it mean for the resource to be an image of you?  You have a
&gt;&gt; resource that is an image.  RFC2616 requires that the server behave as if
&gt;&gt; the image is stored in whatever content-type it declares in response to a
&gt;&gt; GET or HEAD request.
&gt;
&gt; It does?  Where does it claim that?

Again, read my last reply to Roy.

&gt;&gt; You are confusing conneg with raw GET.  The client *should* think of the
&gt;&gt; resource as being a text/xml+svg resource IF that is the content-type the
&gt;&gt; server supplies in response to a GET without an Accept header.

&gt; knows both the text/xml+svg and the image/gif content-types, and the
&gt; resource can be expressed as either, then I think it's foolish for the
&gt; client to think that the resource is just text/xml+svg.

Quoting myself from my last reply to Roy:
""""""
"""
The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
entity) is identified by the Request-URI.
[...]
The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types
which are acceptable for the response.
[...]
If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the client
accepts all media types.
"""
[RFC2616]

So when a client sends a GET, it expects the information identified by the
resource. If "whatever information" means ALL information without data
loss, the client can reasonably interpret the response to a GET to *BE* the
server's representation. (Obviously when the client sends an Accept
header, it accepting non-fidelity to the server's actual representation,
but that is really beside the point here. GET without an Accept header
implies fidelity).
""""""

&gt;&gt; &gt; That is an implementation detail that has nothing to do

&gt;&gt; subordinate to an Identity?  How can a client know that?
&gt;
&gt; What does this matter to the client?

Because otherwise the client isn't POSTing according to the definition in 
RFC2616.  It is just using another method that is also called POST (in 
violation of HTTP).

&gt;&gt; &gt; Because POST is sufficient.  I don't see that creating a new method 
would
&gt;&gt; &gt; be any more helpful.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You are *already* creating a new method, the only question is whether you

In what sense does POSTing an RNA notification imply a request that it be 
accepted as a new subordinate of the inbox?
What does it mean for a notification to be a new subordinate of an inbox?

&gt; In what sense does POSTing an RNA notification imply a request that it be

&gt; What does it mean for a notification to be a new subordinate of an inbox?
&gt; 

What does it mean for /you/ for a resource to be subordinate to an other
? it is not related to the uri, since they are opaque. It is not a
'index' question, since a file is subordinate to a directory (see rfc)
and when you get a directory (at least in Apache) you get an index and
not the content. Do you mean that Apache violate http ?
So what is subordination ? For me, it is just a kind of "relational
integrity" in rdbs (foreign keys, on.. cascade, trigers...) 
an message(mid,from,date,body) table is subordinate to a
box(title,id,desc) by sub(box.id,message.mid). You can select an index
(i.e. just all the ids of messages in the box) or an archive (all
messages) and to delete a box mean to delete all messages it contains.
But boxes and messages have there own namespaces (uri in the rest world)
This is how I understand subordination. (I don't mean that ressources
must be stored in an rdbs, it is just an analogy).

&gt; Nothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources.  You can

&gt; the only way to add a message to a container is...to add a message to a 
&gt; container, making the message subordinate to the container.  Indexes don't

What in a container representation, has you stated, imply that it is a
container is the content type. In your example, I know that I can POST a
mime/rfc822 because the inbox is message/delivery. But your doc is one
line because the documentation of these content-type has already been
done. Someone can't use your message system without reading all the mime

You need to define/select content-types *no matter what*.  My point is that 
you DON'T need to define the behavior of HTTP methods because RFC2616 
already does that.  If you are defining behavior for existing HTTP methods, 
you are probably violating the RFC.  And if you don't want to read the MIME 
RFCs, define a shorter content-type format:

===Syntax===
text/notification-container: part*
part: location? "\n" text/notification "\n"
location: URL
text/notification: (name-value-pair \s)*
name-value-pair: name ":" value "\n"
name: [^\s:]+
value: [^\n&lt;&gt;]*
identity: value "&lt;" [A-z0-9]+ "@" DOMAIN-NAME "&gt;"
==Semantics==
"Location" name identifies notified resource. requires URL value
"From" name identifies notifier, requires identity value

Hmm 12 more lines in ~5 min.  Still much less work than all of RNA.

Note: Your container syntax MUST be a container for MIME types or you can't 
POST to it.

An index is, by definition, a container only of pointers and not of the 
indexed information itself.  You can *say* otherwise.  It just wouldn't be 
true.

&gt; Starting from the perspective of what a resource can accept via POST is 
&gt; incorrect.
&gt; You must start from the perspective of what the resource *IS* then you know 
&gt; what content-types can be made subordinate via a POST.
&gt; 
&gt; So my question to you is: what is this thing that you want to store your 
&gt; various content-types?  Is there an existing content-type that describes 
&gt; it?  If not, you need to define one so that, at least nominally.

The resource is a message, that can be represented by various
content-types, an thus the server can accept any of them, and return any
of them... 

&gt; Once you do that, the client can do a HEAD of the URI and see that it has
&gt; content-type: application/x-yannick-container
&gt; 
&gt; A google search on this content type reveals what resources types can be 
&gt; subordinate to it.  Now you know what you can POST.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, how the server actually stores your container type is *irrelevant*. 
&gt; Confusion caused by the vagueness of ReST.  All that matters is that it 
&gt; acts as if the resource has the content-type claimed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; In what sense does POSTing an RNA notification imply a request that it
&gt; &gt;&gt; be  accepted as a new subordinate of the inbox?
&gt; &gt;&gt; What does it mean for a notification to be a new subordinate of an inbox?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What does it mean for /you/ for a resource to be subordinate to an other
&gt; &gt; ? it is not related to the uri, since they are opaque. It is not a
&gt; &gt; 'index' question, since a file is subordinate to a directory (see rfc)
&gt; &gt; and when you get a directory (at least in Apache) you get an index and
&gt; &gt; not the content. Do you mean that Apache violate http ?
&gt; 
&gt; Justin asked this same question and I answered it.  Not all resources that 
&gt; have subordinates are POSTable.  For example, since directories are not 
&gt; POSTable, it is ok for the server to return an index of their subordinates. 
&gt; The subordinates are identifiable as such because HTTP URIs are 
&gt; hierarchical (not completely opaque).

http rfc2616 state that a file is subordinate to a directory ... in the
POST section!! How can you say that a directory is not postable ??

&lt;quote page='53'&gt;
9.5 POST

   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed
   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:

      - Annotation of existing resources;

      - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
        or similar group of articles;

      - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;

      - Extending a database through an append operation.

   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
   server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity
   is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate
   to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a
   newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
   database.
&lt;/quote&gt;

if my uri is http://host/messages?mid=132346132 , it's not
hierarchical... but the message is still subordinate to the box. (se
quote above), as long as a ref to that URI is present in the result of
the GET on the box uri (a external content in the header of a
mime/rfc822 in an message/digest if you want).

Subject:The truth about POST?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>There has been much discussion about how POST should or shouldn't be used.
What seems to be a major sticking point is the relationship of the request
entity to the resource.  For reference (RFC2616 9.5):

    The POST method is used to request that the origin
    server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a
    new subordinate of the resource identified by the
    Request-URI in the Request-Line."

Note that this does not say that the request entity is a "subordinate
resource".  It only says that it is "a new suboridnate of the resource".
Though some may disagree, that's a world of difference.  POST never once
claims that the request entity is a resource.  All it claims is that the
target resource can make a resource out of the request entity.  This is
evident by the variety of functions that POST can handle:

    - Annotation of existing resources;

    - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,
      mailing list, or similar group of articles;

    - Providing a block of data, such as the result of
      submitting a form, to a data-handling process;

    - Extending a database through an append operation.

Make special note of the third example.

Now, the POST definition also says:

    The actual function performed by the POST method is
    determined by the server and is usually dependent on
    the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to
    that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to
    a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate
    to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is
    subordinate to a database.

When trying to clarify what the definition means by "subordinate", it
focuses on easily visualizable concepts where "subordination" is already a
well-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive
clarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is that
the request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other way around.
A record cannot insert itself into a database, the database must insert a
record into itself.  The same can be said for file/directories and
articles/newsgroups.

The next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not itself
treat the request entity as a resource.

    The action performed by the POST method might not
    result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In
    this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the
    appropriate response status, depending on whether or
    not the response includes an entity that describes
    the result.

 Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also, I
would argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid response,
but that's a minor issue.)

And the last relevant part of the specification is:

    If a resource has been created on the origin server,
    the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain
    an entity which describes the status of the request
    and refers to the new resource, and a Location header
    (see section 14.30).

Now, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity to a
resource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to the
definition, the response entity is the "status" of the request, not a
representation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even if
the POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST itself is
still nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In other
words, the response is still just the output of the target resource function
based on the input.


And that's it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of
additional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily
directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that accept
POST requests and give back a response.  That's it.  Boring, but quite
useful.

<pre>Seairth,

POST requires that it is *meaningful* for the request-entity to be a 
subordinate of the target resource.  For example, it is meaningful to talk 
about POSTing a log-entry to a log-file because we understand that 
log-entry can be a subordinate of a logfile (even if the log-entry never 
gets its own URI).

In contrast, I'm still waiting for you to explain how an RNA notification 
is subordinate to an RNA inbox.  Is it subordinate "in the same way that a 
file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is 
subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is 
subordinate to a database?"  Unless you define what an inbox is, you can't 
really POST to it.

And, my more general point is, once you define what an inbox is, you don't 
need specifically to document POST as it is defined entirely by the 
semantics of RFC2616 and your definition of an inbox.

&gt; Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily
&gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that
&gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That's it.

There is no way to violate the semantics of POST under this interpretation; 
it has no meaning.  If POST means nothing in particular, why not use 
another verb name?  At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED 
to determine whether or not the resource has the behavior you expect from 
your method.

&gt;
&gt;At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED

501 cannot be used on a resource-by-resource level.  The documentation says
the respsonse is appropriate "when the server does not recognize the request
method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource."  Note the "any
resource" part.  Instead, you should be using 405 ("method not allowed").

<pre>Alex,

It could be you're reading too much into the term 'subordinate'.  It
could be that all RFC2616 means to express is the difference between
PUT and POST.  It could be that 'subordinate' means, roughly,
'yielding control', so that the resource POSTed to remains in control
of the operation, as opposed to say, being replaced as a result of
the operation.

It could be that somewhere between POST having no meaning
and POST having a fully specified and complete and final meaning
lies the truth of POST.  According to 2616, that is.

The question is "to what sort of resource is your message a subordinate?"

&gt; http rfc2616 state that a file is subordinate to a directory ... in the
&gt; POST section!! How can you say that a directory is not postable ??

POST implies that there is an obvious meaning to a request for an entity to 
become a subordinate.  I am not sure how you POST to a directory because 
directory semantics usually require a file name to get stuff put in the 
directory.

If you are defining a directory-style resource that accepts POST and 
assigned random directory names, that's fine, but then, again, you need to 
communicate that in the content-type!

Why do you oppose requiring the user to ask for an index if the use wants 
an index?


&gt; if my uri is http://host/messages?mid=132346132 , it's not
&gt; hierarchical... but the message is still subordinate to the box. (se
&gt; quote above), as long as a ref to that URI is present in the result of
&gt; the GET on the box uri (a external content in the header of a
&gt; mime/rfc822 in an message/digest if you want).

What is the URI of your box and when you do a raw GET, does the server 
return "whatever information" is referenced by the URI?  Does that 
information include the fact that it is meaningful for a message to be 
subordinate to your resource?
If I receive an index in response to a raw GET, how do I know whether I am 
supposed to POST notifications (a la RNA) or messages (as you seem to want)?
Does an index-type communicate that the resource is POSTable?  Directory 
indexes communicate only that the resource is a container.

Alex, it could be you're reading too much meaning into "whatever".  I
read it to mean "whatever the implementation/authority deems fit", not
"every last bit of information possibly associated with the resource".
Isn't the latter just a bit extreme?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] The truth about POST?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I am not requiring all that much of the term subordinate.  It just has to 
have a clear meaning with respect to a POSTed request entity and a target 
resource.  Unless the client knows what it means for a request entity to be 
a subordinate of a target resource it can't make a request for the server 
to do make it so.  Either it is making a request for something else, or it 
is making a request for something random.  The only way for the client to 
know what it means for a request entity to be subordinate to a particular 
resource is for it to have a model of what the resource actually is and how 
another entity can be subordinate to that resource.

The question on the table is how the client discovers this model.

If the client discovers this model via out-of-band documentation, then 
there is really no reason to restrict the method name used to being POST. 
If we have to learn about a resource specific definition of "subordinate" 
for each resource, then we are better off proliferating method names and 
relying on 405 (thank you Seairth for the correction) to tell us what is 
going on.

Question for Seairth: Why do you insist on using POST?

If you do insist on using POST then implicitly you are saying that the 
client can acquire this model from within HTTP itself (without reference to 
custom resource APIs).  I think the only way HTTP provides for acquiring 
this model is by the client knowing the content-type of the target 
resource.

Alternative question for Seairth: If you do insist on using POST, how does 
the client know what it means?

Yet another version of this same question: Can you give an example of how a 
server could in theory return 200 and still violate the semantics of POST?

If you can't (if everything is permitted), then again why restricting 
yourself to this one method name.  Wouldn't it be better to proliferate 
method names corresponding to each service provided and use 405 to know 
what is actually available.

&gt; It could be you're reading too much into the term 'subordinate'.  It
&gt; could be that all RFC2616 means to express is the difference between
&gt; PUT and POST.  It could be that 'subordinate' means, roughly,

&gt;
&gt; It could be that somewhere between POST having no meaning

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Seairth,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; POST requires that it is *meaningful* for the request-entity to be a
&gt;&gt; subordinate of the target resource.  For example, it is meaningful to
&gt;&gt; talk about POSTing a log-entry to a log-file because we understand that
&gt;&gt; log-entry can be a subordinate of a logfile (even if the log-entry never
&gt;&gt; gets its own URI).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In contrast, I'm still waiting for you to explain how an RNA notification
&gt;&gt; is subordinate to an RNA inbox.  Is it subordinate "in the same way that
&gt;&gt; a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is
&gt;&gt; subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is
&gt;&gt; subordinate to a database?"  Unless you define what an inbox is, you
&gt;&gt; can't really POST to it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And, my more general point is, once you define what an inbox is, you
&gt;&gt; don't need specifically to document POST as it is defined entirely by the
&gt;&gt; semantics of RFC2616 and your definition of an inbox.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily
&gt;&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that
&gt;&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That's it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is no way to violate the semantics of POST under this
&gt;&gt; interpretation
&gt; ;
&gt;&gt; it has no meaning.  If POST means nothing in particular, why not use
&gt;&gt; another verb name?  At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED
&gt;&gt; to determine whether or not the resource has the behavior you expect from
&gt;&gt; your method.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; There has been much discussion about how POST should or shouldn't be
&gt; used.
&gt;&gt; &gt; What seems to be a major sticking point is the relationship of the
&gt; request
&gt;&gt; &gt; entity to the resource.  For reference (RFC2616 9.5):
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     The POST method is used to request that the origin
&gt;&gt; &gt;     server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a
&gt;&gt; &gt;     new subordinate of the resource identified by the
&gt;&gt; &gt;     Request-URI in the Request-Line."
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Note that this does not say that the request entity is a "subordinate
&gt;&gt; &gt; resource".  It only says that it is "a new suboridnate of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; resource". Though some may disagree, that's a world of difference.
&gt;&gt; &gt; POST never once claims that the request entity is a resource.  All it
&gt;&gt; &gt; claims is that the target resource can make a resource out of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; request entity.  This is evident by the variety of functions that POST
&gt;&gt; &gt; can handle:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Annotation of existing resources;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,
&gt;&gt; &gt;       mailing list, or similar group of articles;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Providing a block of data, such as the result of
&gt;&gt; &gt;       submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Extending a database through an append operation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Make special note of the third example.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, the POST definition also says:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     The actual function performed by the POST method is
&gt;&gt; &gt;     determined by the server and is usually dependent on
&gt;&gt; &gt;     the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to
&gt;&gt; &gt;     that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to
&gt;&gt; &gt;     a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate
&gt;&gt; &gt;     to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is
&gt;&gt; &gt;     subordinate to a database.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; When trying to clarify what the definition means by "subordinate", it
&gt;&gt; &gt; focuses on easily visualizable concepts where "subordination" is
&gt;&gt; &gt; already
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt; well-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive
&gt;&gt; &gt; clarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is
&gt;&gt; &gt; that the request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other
&gt;&gt; &gt; way around. A record cannot insert itself into a database, the
&gt;&gt; &gt; database must insert a record into itself.  The same can be said for
&gt;&gt; &gt; file/directories and articles/newsgroups.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not
&gt;&gt; &gt; itself treat the request entity as a resource.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     The action performed by the POST method might not
&gt;&gt; &gt;     result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In
&gt;&gt; &gt;     this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;     appropriate response status, depending on whether or
&gt;&gt; &gt;     not the response includes an entity that describes
&gt;&gt; &gt;     the result.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also,
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt; would argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid
&gt;&gt; &gt; response, but that's a minor issue.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; And the last relevant part of the specification is:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     If a resource has been created on the origin server,
&gt;&gt; &gt;     the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain
&gt;&gt; &gt;     an entity which describes the status of the request
&gt;&gt; &gt;     and refers to the new resource, and a Location header
&gt;&gt; &gt;     (see section 14.30).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt; resource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; definition, the response entity is the "status" of the request, not a
&gt;&gt; &gt; representation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even
&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt; the POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST
&gt; itself
&gt;&gt; &gt; is still nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In
&gt;&gt; &gt; other words, the response is still just the output of the target
&gt; resource
&gt;&gt; &gt; function based on the input.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; And that's it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of
&gt;&gt; &gt; additional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily
&gt;&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that
&gt;&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That's it.  Boring, but
&gt;&gt; &gt; quite useful.

&gt; I am not requiring all that much of the term subordinate.  It just has to

It's clearly different from PUT.  Where is it written that it must be
any clearer than that?  I think you're forcing that interpretation.

&gt; I am not requiring all that much of the term subordinate.  It just has to
&gt; have a clear meaning with respect to a POSTed request entity and a target
&gt; resource.  Unless the client knows what it means for a request entity to
&gt; be a subordinate of a target resource it can't make a request for the
server
&gt; to do make it so.  Either it is making a request for something else, or it
&gt; is making a request for something random.  The only way for the client to
&gt; know what it means for a request entity to be subordinate to a particular
&gt; resource is for it to have a model of what the resource actually is and
&gt; how another entity can be subordinate to that resource.

Why does the client need to know anything more than what it POSTs and what
is returned?  If the request entity of a POST is acceptable by the server,
then the client knows that the request entity is subordinate in some fashion
to that resource.  If the server returns a representation of the resource
that client understands, then the client know what the server has told it
about that resource.  Beyond that, what does the client need to know?

In the case of RNA, there was nothing to return. The resource behind the
"InboxURI" is a black hole.  Stuff only goes in.  The resource has a
separate URI which allows all sorts of additional manipulation (if
authenticated) like GET and DELETE.  So why would the client that POSTs to
the InboxURI need to know anything about the resource?  The client knows
what a request entity with a content-type of
application/rna.notification+xml is.  It knows that, upon receiving a 2xx
response, the resource accepted the request entity.

 (NOTE: The "separate URI" mentioned above is not specifically defined by
RNA, only hinted at.  The implementation of that URI is up to the needs of
the specification using RNA as the "front end".  Maybe this has been the
problem.  Maybe the spec was not clear enough, specifically that it could
not be used as a stand-alone specification.  It needs an additional spec to
provide the "other half" of the application.  However, there isn't
necessarily a single "other" spec, which is why it was not included in RNA.)

&gt; If you do insist on using POST then implicitly you are saying that the
&gt; client can acquire this model from within HTTP itself (without reference
&gt; to custom resource APIs).  I think the only way HTTP provides for
&gt; acquiring this model is by the client knowing the content-type of the
&gt; target resource.

I do not see why content-type would be enough.  For example, what would it
mean to a client that a resource (as perceived through its representation)
is an image/jpeg or application/xml?  How does that tell a client whether
you can GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE?  I suppose one could certainly define a
content-type with specific HTTP bindings, but that puts unreasonable
constraints on how the content-type may be used.  Maybe you are using
"content-type" in a way different than myself?  My meaning is limited to the
HTTP content-type header field.

&gt; Alternative question for Seairth: If you do insist on using POST, how does
&gt; the client know what it means?

What is "it"? The POST request?  The server?

&gt; Yet another version of this same question: Can you give an example of how

Is that question correct?  You seem to be asking me to give an example to

<pre>&gt; Why does the client need to know anything more than what it POSTs and what

Because unless the server knows what the client intends in making a 
request, it cannot return 200 OK.  If the client has no idea what the 
result of a POST actually will be then the server can have no idea what the 
client's intention was in making the POST.  If the server has no idea what 
the client's intention was in making the POST it cannot make the claim that 
"The request has succeeded."(RFC2616 10.2.1)

&gt; In the case of RNA [...] The client knows
&gt; what a request entity with a content-type of
&gt; application/rna.notification+xml is.  It knows that, upon receiving a 2xx
&gt; response, the resource accepted the request entity.

And did what with it?  What did the client intend in POSTing the 
notification?

&gt;&gt; If you do insist on using POST then implicitly you are saying that the
&gt;&gt; client can acquire this model from within HTTP itself (without reference
&gt;&gt; to custom resource APIs).  I think the only way HTTP provides for
&gt;&gt; acquiring this model is by the client knowing the content-type of the
&gt;&gt; target resource.
&gt;
&gt; I do not see why content-type would be enough.  For example, what would it
&gt; mean to a client that a resource (as perceived through its representation)
&gt; is an image/jpeg or application/xml?

Assuming that the server returned the content-type in response to a raw-GET 
or raw-HEAD, the client knows that:
1. The server will act as if the resource is an instance of that 
content-type (even if its internal-representation/storage-model is 
different).  Therefore a change of content-type in response to another 
raw-GET or raw-HEAD implies a change of state not simply a change in the 
representation of that state.

2. The server will not return 413 Media Type Not Supported in response to a 
PUT of that content-type

3. If it is meaningful for another content-type to be a subordinate of the 
resource's content-type, the server will not return 413 in response to a 
POST of that content-type to that URI AND if the server returns 200, it 
will in fact make the POSTed entity of the resource in the manner implied 
by the content-type.  Since image/jpeg and application/xml do not provide a 
meaning for another entity to be subordinate, the server may return either 
413 or 405 in response to a POST to that resource.

&gt; How does that tell a client whether
&gt; you can GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE?

status codes and content-type.

But the real question is again how the server knows whether to return 200 
OK in response to such a request?  It can only return 200 OK if it knows 
what the client requested.  Since the intentions of a GET, PUT, and DELETE 
are obvious (though Yannick's original notification spec violated even 
DELETE), the only question left is how the server should interpret a POST 
request.  Unless there is a private out of band communication with the 
client, the only way it can constrain the meaning of POST enough to return 
200 is via the relation between the resource content-type and the POSTed 
content-type.  If the resource has no content-type, the server has no idea 
what the client means when it requests that the POSTed entity be made 
subordinate to that resource.

&gt;&gt; Alternative question for Seairth: If you do insist on using POST, how
&gt;&gt; does the client know what it means?
&gt;
&gt; What is "it"? The POST request?  The server?

I will rephrase the question: If the client makes a POST request, how does 
the server know what the client intended well enough to fulfill the request 
and claim that it succeeded by returning 200 OK?

&gt;&gt; Yet another version of this same question: Can you give an example of how
&gt;&gt; a server could in theory return 200 and still violate the semantics of
&gt; POST?
&gt;
&gt; Is that question correct?  You seem to be asking me to give an example to
&gt; disprove myself... I think...

If you can't give such an example, you need to explain why RFC2616 did not 
define POST simply as a catchall request that the server do some arbitrary 
server determined action with the request entity.  You need to explain all 
the verbiage about subordinate resources etc etc.

And, if you do believe POST is just such a catchall method, you actually 
need to explain why they bothered to define POST at all because then under 
your interpretation POST has no particular identifiable semantics and 
therefore "cannot be assumed to share the same semantics for separately 
extended clients and servers."(RFC2616 sect. 9)

In other words, if POST has no particular identifiable semantics, the only 
way for the server to claim accurately that a POST request succeed (200 
OK), is for it to have negotiated a private meaning of POST for that 
resource.  If you are defining a private API anyway, then there is no 
particular reason to use a
public method name and actually a good reason to use private method names 
so you can take advantage of 405 and 503 status codes and give more 
visibility to intermediaries about what is actually being done.

Can you give any good reason to use POST as the name of your RNA 
notification method?  Why not use RNA-NOTIFY?

&gt;
&gt; It's clearly different from PUT.  Where is it written that it must be

It must be clear enough for the server to be able claim that the request 
succeeded (200 OK).  If the server doesn't know the meaning of the request, 
it can't return 200 OK.  And if the meaning of the request is subject to a 
private negotiation between the server operator and the client operator, 
then there is no particular reason to use a public method name.

How else can you interpret the beginning of section 9 of RFC2616:
"""
   The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below. Although
   this set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to
   share the same semantics for separately extended clients and servers.
"""

If POST is a catchall, it is not a "common method" it is a private method 
with a public name and client and servers cannot assume that they share the 
same semantics when the method is used.

If POST has a specific meaning then it is a "common method" for all HTTP 
clients and servers.  If you have a different specific meaning for POST, 
please share.  But if you are saying that POST has no specific meaning at 
all, then I think you are talking about a protocol other than HTTP/1.1.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] The truth about POST?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Reiteration/clarification of my prior post:

The server needs to know what the client meant in making request  in order 
to claim that the request succeeded (200 OK).

Either the meaning of a POST is constrained by the request-entity and the 
requested URI or it is constrained by the request-entity and the 
content-type of the resource identified by that URI.

If you believe the former, then you believe the client cannot make a POST 
request without some out of band communication with the server and perhaps 
we should rename the POST method to DO_SOMETHING_WITH_THIS_REQUEST_ENTITY. 
If you believe the former then you should acknowledge that POST has no 
public definition at all (the intro to section 9 of rfc2616, 
notwithstanding) and that you really don't need a generic method name at 
all because the semantics are private between the client and server in any 
case (that you should really use a private method name).

However, if you insist on using POST as your method name, you MUST think 
that POST has a public meaning and therefore that clients can make a POST 
request without an out-of-band communication with a server operator.  I 
think the only way to constrain the meaning enough for the server to 
understand the client's intentions is via content-type.  If you can think 
of another constraint, please say so.

If you cannot provide another constraint, then you must conclude that 
content-type is the only way to constrain meaning, that the client must 
understand the content-type of the resource in order to POST to it, that 
therefore HTTP is about transferring the resource-model via content-type 
(the MoST thesis is correct), and that the server may NOT arbitrarily 
reinterpret the meaning of HTTP methods in a way that is visible to the 
client (the REST thesis is either vague or wrong).

&gt; 
&gt; Assuming that the server returned the content-type in response to a raw-GET 
&gt; or raw-HEAD, the client knows that:
&gt; 1. The server will act as if the resource is an instance of that 
&gt; content-type (even if its internal-representation/storage-model is 
&gt; different).  Therefore a change of content-type in response to another 
&gt; raw-GET or raw-HEAD implies a change of state not simply a change in the 
&gt; representation of that state.

rfc2616 states that a post can be used to add comments to a document
(e.g.). So the "raw get" retrun an html document, which can accept ...
say xml+xlink anotea-like comments... it's not the same content-type...
how can you assume that? because in a wiki-like system, a post of html
to http://host/doc.html#section can mean that I want to add a paragraph
to this section... or any other example where you post to a "html"
document...

&gt; 3. If it is meaningful for another content-type to be a subordinate of the 
&gt; resource's content-type, the server will not return 413 in response to a 
&gt; POST of that content-type to that URI AND if the server returns 200, it 
&gt; will in fact make the POSTed entity of the resource in the manner implied 
&gt; by the content-type.  Since image/jpeg and application/xml do not provide a 
&gt; meaning for another entity to be subordinate, the server may return either 
&gt; 413 or 405 in response to a POST to that resource.

For me, it is meaningful to post EXIF metadata to a image/jpeg. It's
juste an example of the fact that you (the client or the server) can't
presume of what can be meaningful in a post for the other side of the
application. If I make a system that *in a "row get"* return image/jpeg,
and allow a POST of metadat (exif of other similar system), And if I
don't give you additional doc, you'll never use this functionality,
simply assuming that you can't POST to a image/jpeg ?? Meatadata are
"subordinate" to the image, at least in my interpretation of what
"subordinate" means), so I can POST them to an image if the system
allows it...

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Simple URI Discovery Syntax (SUDS)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Heh.  I warned that it was a rough draft.... :)

From: "Walden Mathews" &lt;waldenm@...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1. Does a remote application want to discover URIs, or does it want
&gt; to discover resources?

I agree that a remote application wants to discover resources.  However, in
order to work with those resources, it must do so through URIs and
representations.  The objective of SUDS to get ahold of the URI of a
resource, not the resource itself. I need to go reword all of that stuff.

&gt; 2. What is a "resource URI", as opposed to a regular URI?

I didn't see "resource URI" in the document.  Oh wait, that was in the
e-mail.  In answer, there is no difference.  It probably would have been
better to read as "resource's URI".  After all, what you are after is the
URI, not the resource (that's what you use the aquired URI for).

&gt; 3. In practice, what would SUDS actually be used for?  A focused
&gt; scenario would help.  In mean, isn't the web really about the discovery
&gt; of resources, one within the context of another?  And if that's the
&gt; case, then where does this scheme fit in?

I don't know if that's what the web is all about, but it certainly is a part
of the equation.   However, the ability to do this effectively seems fairly
limited.  For instance, for any given resource, how can one know if it meets
the needs of your client?  How can a client know what a resource can and
cannot do (or what can be done to the resource)?  If there is a resource
that provides a specific representation through a given URI, how do you find
that URI?  It may be that the URI you currently have for the resource
returns HTML, and it may be that the html document contains &lt;link&gt; elements
to point to this same information.  However, this requires a client to be
capable of parsing html and &lt;link&gt; elements.  But it may be that the URI you
have returns another content-type.  It would then be necessary for the
client to understand that format to get the same information (assuming the
information was available).  SUDS, on the other hand, provides clients to
query this information at the resource level instead of the representation
level.

As for a scenario, let's see...  Suppose you have a blog entry at
http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.  Now, here are the things you could
do with SUDS for that URI:

1) Discover which content-types are available (which your client also
understands).

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="application/pdf"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

returns

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.rss2"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.atom"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""/&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

2) Discover where you can POST comments to.

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

returns

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.comments"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;


Another scenario...  suppose robots.txt files and p3p were given a mime type
(or do they already have one?).  In this case, a query like the following
could be submitted to http://www.example.com/:

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

which would return

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/robots.txt"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/p3p.xml"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/logo.jpg"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

Yet another scenario...  suppose you have a URI
(http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss) to a "container" resource.  You
need to know what the client can and cannot do with/to the resource via the
given URI.  So, you POST the following:

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="DELETE"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="POST"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="PUT"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts conent-type="text/html"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

returns

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss"&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts http-method="POST" conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
        &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
        &lt;returns content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
        &lt;returns content-type="application/pdf" content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
        &lt;returns content-type="text/xhtml+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

(hmm... maybe this should be about interfaces, not URIs... Resource
Interface Discovery Syntax (RIDS)?)


I have another example using an extended SUDS document, which is connected
to my RNA stuff, but I'm not ready to show that one yet...

So, how does any of this work for you?

I think I'm still missing a big, important piece.  It looks like you have
some SUDS server that can basically answer questions about
syntax, but if I was looking for a resource in a serious way, I
would care more initially about the semantics, not the syntax, and
I don't see how you've addressed that (not meaning to sound as
if I think you should, mind you).

By analogy, it would be as if I went to The Home Depot in search
of a tool with seventeen moving parts and a power cord.

Also, I'm assuming this is a central registry kind of thing, as
opposed to a metadata service provided by SUDSY resources
generally.  Because instead of doing content negotiation on a
selected resource, it points you to a resource that fits the syntactic
requirement, right?

It's true that I haven't directly addressed semantics.  However, there are
various levels of semantic discovery.  For instance, in the case of the blog
example, if I POST a SUDS document to the URI of the entry resource:

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

and I get back

&lt;suds&gt;
    &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.comments"&gt;
        &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/sud&gt;
&lt;/suds&gt;

what more needs to be known?  The semantics are wrapped up in the
content-type, http-method, and the relationship to the resource that
processed the SUDS request.  Now, I am not saying this is sufficient for all
needs.  I do believe, however, that it's a goog start.  Since the SUDS is
xml-based, it is also possible to extend the request to allow for additional
criteria.  Obviously, the SUDS more or less punts on this to avoid getting
bogged down in the endless possibilities...

&gt; Also, I'm assuming this is a central registry kind of thing, as
&gt; opposed to a metadata service provided by SUDSY resources
&gt; generally.  Because instead of doing content negotiation on a
&gt; selected resource, it points you to a resource that fits the syntactic
&gt; requirement, right?

No, I was thinking about SUDSy resources, though I don't see why a central
registry couldn't be done.  The idea would be to enhance existing resources
to include this functionality.  So, instead of just having a blog entry
resource, you have a blog entry resource capable of processing SUDS
documents.

So, does this clear any of it up, or make things worse?  :)

<pre>In my toolkit, which I currently call Rest++, I have RESTful Template
Library, or RTL, which coexists along side ATL, STL, and WTL frameworks.
RTL uses Xerces-C v2.3 and is what the rest of the samples and services I'm

So if you're using Visual C++ and can use these frameworks in your
application, then you'll have a rich set of tools that cooperate nicely and

How about "application resource space"?

Doesn't have the greatest acronym, though.

We do use the phrase "REST API" in our company, and it has kind
of bugged me. But in design discussions we talk about "mapping
concepts to the resource space", so that seems to be the idea to

&gt; Heh.  I warned that it was a rough draft.... :)
&gt;
&gt; From: "Walden Mathews" &lt;waldenm@...&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Does a remote application want to discover URIs, or does it want
&gt;&gt; to discover resources?
&gt;
&gt; I agree that a remote application wants to discover resources.  However,
&gt; in order to work with those resources, it must do so through URIs and
&gt; representations.  The objective of SUDS to get ahold of the URI of a
&gt; resource, not the resource itself. I need to go reword all of that stuff.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. What is a "resource URI", as opposed to a regular URI?
&gt;
&gt; I didn't see "resource URI" in the document.  Oh wait, that was in the
&gt; e-mail.  In answer, there is no difference.  It probably would have been
&gt; better to read as "resource's URI".  After all, what you are after is the
&gt; URI, not the resource (that's what you use the aquired URI for).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. In practice, what would SUDS actually be used for?  A focused
&gt;&gt; scenario would help.  In mean, isn't the web really about the discovery
&gt;&gt; of resources, one within the context of another?  And if that's the
&gt;&gt; case, then where does this scheme fit in?
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if that's what the web is all about, but it certainly is a
&gt; part of the equation.   However, the ability to do this effectively seems
&gt; fairly limited.  For instance, for any given resource, how can one know
&gt; if it meets the needs of your client?  How can a client know what a
&gt; resource can and cannot do (or what can be done to the resource)?  If
&gt; there is a resource that provides a specific representation through a
&gt; given URI, how do you find that URI?  It may be that the URI you
&gt; currently have for the resource returns HTML, and it may be that the html
&gt; document contains &lt;link&gt; elements to point to this same information.
&gt; However, this requires a client to be capable of parsing html and &lt;link&gt;
&gt; elements.  But it may be that the URI you have returns another
&gt; content-type.  It would then be necessary for the client to understand
&gt; that format to get the same information (assuming the information was
&gt; available).  SUDS, on the other hand, provides clients to query this
&gt; information at the resource level instead of the representation level.
&gt;
&gt; As for a scenario, let's see...  Suppose you have a blog entry at
&gt; http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.  Now, here are the things you
&gt; could do with SUDS for that URI:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Discover which content-types are available (which your client also
&gt; understands).
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="application/pdf"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; returns
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.rss2"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.atom"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""/&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2) Discover where you can POST comments to.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; returns
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.comments"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="POST" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Another scenario...  suppose robots.txt files and p3p were given a mime
&gt; type (or do they already have one?).  In this case, a query like the
&gt; following could be submitted to http://www.example.com/:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; which would return
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/robots.txt"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/p3p.xml"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/logo.jpg"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yet another scenario...  suppose you have a URI
&gt; (http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss) to a "container" resource.
&gt; You need to know what the client can and cannot do with/to the resource
&gt; via the given URI.  So, you POST the following:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="DELETE"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="PUT"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/html"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; returns
&gt;
&gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST" conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns content-type="application/pdf" content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xhtml+xml"/&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;
&gt; (hmm... maybe this should be about interfaces, not URIs... Resource
&gt; Interface Discovery Syntax (RIDS)?)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have another example using an extended SUDS document, which is connected
&gt; to my RNA stuff, but I'm not ready to show that one yet...
&gt;
&gt; So, how does any of this work for you?

<pre>Welcome back to this world.  :)

In answer to your question: simplicity.  SID (which replaced SUDS) can be
learned in a matter of minutes.  No, it is not a perfect solution for all
situations (what is?).  But I think there is a great (or at least
increasing) need for better introspection, and I think that something like
WSDL is overkill for many.

&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;

&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; which would return
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/robots.txt"&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yet another scenario...  suppose you have a URI
&gt; &gt; (http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss) to a "container" resource.
&gt; &gt; You need to know what the client can and cannot do with/to the resource
&gt; &gt; via the given URI.  So, you POST the following:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="DELETE"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="PUT"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/html"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; returns
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss"&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST" conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="application/pdf"
content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xhtml+xml"/&gt;
&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (hmm... maybe this should be about interfaces, not URIs... Resource
&gt; &gt; Interface Discovery Syntax (RIDS)?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have another example using an extended SUDS document, which is
connected
&gt; &gt; to my RNA stuff, but I'm not ready to show that one yet...

<pre>Seairth,

I don't think the question is clear the way you have worded
it.  In concrete terms, "when you GET a representation of a resource,
should that representation include a description of the operations
the resource supports?"  Isn't that closer to the real issue?

In general, aren't questions about the alleged composition of
a resource moot, because representations is all we can really
observe?

&gt; it.  In concrete terms, "when you GET a representation of a resource,
&gt; should that representation include a description of the operations
&gt; the resource supports?"

That's not what I am asking.  Rephrased:

Is the *ability* to perform a GET against a resource part of that resource?
Is the response itself (not just the body) part of that resource?

or

Can a resource be accessible through HTTP and still not have any aspect of
HTTP be part of itself?

In concrete terms, suppose there is a text file (content-type: text/plain).
It exists, but is not accessible (limited to the discussion of HTTP).  It is
resource R.  Now, we make that text file available via HTTP at URI_A.  I can
issue a GET on URI and get back a representation of that text file.  Is it
still resource R or is it now resource R', where the ability to perform a
GET on it and to get back a representation (plus HTTP headers, etc) are also
part of the resource?

&gt; Isn't that closer to the real issue?

Not exactly, though that conversation did spark my question.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] SID (was Re:Simple URI Discovery Syntax)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Ok, but if you are interesting in doing something WSDL-like, why are you 
interested in ReST?  My generic claim is that exposing an resource via HTTP 
is enough to identify its interface without resort to WSDL-like things.

Mark Baker says that is what ReST is about:
&lt;http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2002/11/19#2002-11-reinacker-uniform-
interface&gt;
&lt;http://www.thearchitect.co.uk/weblog/archives/2002/11/000023.html#comments&gt;

Roy says something similar in his thesis:
"""
The semantics are thus not defined by the network interface (IIOP), but by 
the object's IDL spec. Whether this is a good thing or not depends on the 
application -- for distributed objects it is a necessity, for the Web it 
isn't.

Why is this important? Because it differentiates a system where network 
intermediaries can be effective agents from a system where they can be, at 
most, routers.

This kind of difference is also seen in the interpretation of a message as 
a unit or as a stream. HTTP allows the recipient or the sender to decide 
that on their own. CORBA IDL doesn't even allow streams (yet), but even 
when it does get extended to support streams, both sides of the 
communication will be tied to the same API, rather than being free to use 
whatever is most appropriate for their type of application.
[...]
What distinguishes HTTP from RPC isn't the syntax. It isn't even the 
different characteristics gained from using a stream as a parameter, though 
that helps to explain why existing RPC mechanisms were not usable for the 
Web. What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests 
are directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics 
that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines 
that originate services. The result is an application that allows for 
layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the 
information origin, which is very useful for an Internet-scale, 
multi-organization, anarchically scalable information system. RPC 
mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not 
network-based applications.
"""
&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm&gt;

How does this square with SID/SUDS?

&gt; In answer to your question: simplicity.  SID (which replaced SUDS) can be

&gt; situations (what is?).  But I think there is a great (or at least

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Does a remote application want to discover URIs, or does it want
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to discover resources?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree that a remote application wants to discover resources.
&gt;&gt; &gt; However, in order to work with those resources, it must do so through
&gt;&gt; &gt; URIs and representations.  The objective of SUDS to get ahold of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; URI of a resource, not the resource itself. I need to go reword all of
&gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt; stuff.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. What is a "resource URI", as opposed to a regular URI?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I didn't see "resource URI" in the document.  Oh wait, that was in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; e-mail.  In answer, there is no difference.  It probably would have
&gt;&gt; &gt; been better to read as "resource's URI".  After all, what you are
&gt;&gt; &gt; after is
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; URI, not the resource (that's what you use the aquired URI for).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. In practice, what would SUDS actually be used for?  A focused
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; scenario would help.  In mean, isn't the web really about the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; discovery of resources, one within the context of another?  And if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that's the case, then where does this scheme fit in?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't know if that's what the web is all about, but it certainly is a
&gt;&gt; &gt; part of the equation.   However, the ability to do this effectively
&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; &gt; fairly limited.  For instance, for any given resource, how can one know
&gt;&gt; &gt; if it meets the needs of your client?  How can a client know what a
&gt;&gt; &gt; resource can and cannot do (or what can be done to the resource)?  If
&gt;&gt; &gt; there is a resource that provides a specific representation through a
&gt;&gt; &gt; given URI, how do you find that URI?  It may be that the URI you
&gt;&gt; &gt; currently have for the resource returns HTML, and it may be that the
&gt; html
&gt;&gt; &gt; document contains &lt;link&gt; elements to point to this same information.
&gt;&gt; &gt; However, this requires a client to be capable of parsing html and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;link&gt; elements.  But it may be that the URI you have returns another
&gt;&gt; &gt; content-type.  It would then be necessary for the client to understand
&gt;&gt; &gt; that format to get the same information (assuming the information was
&gt;&gt; &gt; available).  SUDS, on the other hand, provides clients to query this
&gt;&gt; &gt; information at the resource level instead of the representation level.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; As for a scenario, let's see...  Suppose you have a blog entry at
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.  Now, here are the things you
&gt;&gt; &gt; could do with SUDS for that URI:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Discover which content-types are available (which your client also
&gt;&gt; &gt; understands).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="application/pdf"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; returns
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.rss2"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.atom"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Discover where you can POST comments to.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="POST"
&gt;&gt; &gt;         conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt; &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; returns
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.comments"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="POST"
&gt;&gt; &gt;         conent-type="application/atom+xml"/&gt; &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Another scenario...  suppose robots.txt files and p3p were given a mime
&gt;&gt; &gt; type (or do they already have one?).  In this case, a query like the
&gt;&gt; &gt; following could be submitted to http://www.example.com/:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; which would return
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/robots.txt"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="text/robots"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/policies/p3p.xml"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="application/p3p+xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/logo.jpg"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns http-method="GET" conent-type="image/jpeg"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yet another scenario...  suppose you have a URI
&gt;&gt; &gt; (http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss) to a "container" resource.
&gt;&gt; &gt; You need to know what the client can and cannot do with/to the resource
&gt;&gt; &gt; via the given URI.  So, you POST the following:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri=""&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="DELETE"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="PUT"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/html"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; returns
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;sud uri="http://www.example.com/groups/rest-discuss"&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="GET"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts http-method="POST" conent-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;accepts content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="application/pdf"
&gt; content-encoding="gzip"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;         &lt;returns content-type="text/xhtml+xml"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     &lt;/sud&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/suds&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; (hmm... maybe this should be about interfaces, not URIs... Resource
&gt;&gt; &gt; Interface Discovery Syntax (RIDS)?)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have another example using an extended SUDS document, which is
&gt; connected
&gt;&gt; &gt; to my RNA stuff, but I'm not ready to show that one yet...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; So, how does any of this work for you?

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't think the question is clear the way you have worded
&gt;&gt;it.  In concrete terms, "when you GET a representation of a resource,
&gt;&gt;should that representation include a description of the operations
&gt;&gt;the resource supports?"
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That's not what I am asking.  Rephrased:
&gt;
&gt;Is the *ability* to perform a GET against a resource part of that resource?
&gt;

Is that the same as 'Is the ability to respond to a GET request  part of 
the resource?'

&gt;Is the response itself (not just the body) part of that resource?
&gt;  
&gt;

Are the words that are used to describe an idea part of the idea?

I'm not sure how to determine the answer to your question.  My instinct 
is to say that the HTTP stuff is not part of the resource, but at this 
point, I'm not sure how I would defend that statement (give me a while 
and I might come up with something).


&gt;or
&gt;
&gt;Can a resource be accessible through HTTP and still not have any aspect of
&gt;HTTP be part of itself?
&gt;
&gt;In concrete terms, suppose there is a text file (content-type: text/plain).
&gt;It exists, but is not accessible (limited to the discussion of HTTP).  It is
&gt;resource R.  Now, we make that text file available via HTTP at URI_A.  I can
&gt;issue a GET on URI and get back a representation of that text file.  Is it
&gt;still resource R or is it now resource R', where the ability to perform a
&gt;GET on it and to get back a representation (plus HTTP headers, etc) are also
&gt;part of the resource?
&gt;  
&gt;

A couple of points.

I seem to remember something somewhere talking about how resources may 
be composed of other resources (which is what I think your example 
describes).  I think in your example, you have identified two resources 
- one that is accessible via HTTP (R') and one that is not (R).  The one 
accessible via HTTP (R') is composed of another resource (R) that is not 
accessible via HTTP. (Either that or you have a resource that is 
accessible via two different mechanisms - your definition doesnt give 
enough detail for me to know which is the case.)

The second point is that a GET on R' by definition returns a 
representation of R', not R.  It may happen that the representations of 
the two resources are the same, but that doesnt change what you call the 
results of a GET on R'.  How a resource's representations are produced 
(e.g., retrieve from file or from database) is an implementation detail, 
and I wouldn't normally consider that detail to be relevant to the 
definition of the resource (although I'm sure there are resources where 
that detail is relevant).

thanks for this, it's very interesting.
 
Some questions:
 
The container provides the ability to specify which media type
it accepts. If this is XML, then it makes sense to use
rf:acceptedNamespace to specify which semantics the conteiner
understands. But what if the input type is not XML but some other
form of semantically structured data? Propably the addition of
a more generic element such as rf:acceptedSemantics could help here?
 
 
Is the intention behind the rf-namespace to signal that the input is
requested or possible now (at the time of parsing) or is the intention
more
to publish the availablility of rf:Containers (e.g. publishing a list
of many rf:Containers to inform 'semantic web agents') in general?
 
 
Also, rf is a fragment-identifier-free namespace. Cool! ;-)

Good to hear, thanks.

"acceptedNamespace" is just a hack to address the problem that
people are using application/xml incorrectly, as if the application
were dispatched on the namespace rather than the media type.  I should
probably say that in my description.

&gt; Is the intention behind the rf-namespace to signal that the input is
&gt; requested or possible now (at the time of parsing) or is the intention
&gt; more
&gt; to publish the availablility of rf:Containers (e.g. publishing a list
&gt; of many rf:Containers to inform 'semantic web agents') in general?

The latter.  I think the former is best handled out of band to a
mechanism such as this.

&gt; Also, rf is a fragment-identifier-free namespace. Cool! ;-)

HEAD gives you the content-type which implies both the allowed POSTable 
types and the allowed query strings.

If the server does not support all the content-types, entities, and query 
strings implied by the content-type of the resource identified by the 
target URI, it can return the above status codes.  If the content-type of 
the target resource does not sufficiently constrain the client, choose a

The semantic web needs is better documentation of content-types.  It does 
not need better documentation of the capabilities of particular URIs.

Right.  Tim's wrong.  This is the rathole known as httpRange-14[1] in
W3C TAGland.  Tim believes that the range of http URIs is a "conceptual
work", whereas others, including Roy and myself, believe that the range
of http URIs (and indeed, any URI) is all resources.

&gt; Exactly what purpose does this spec serve that is not already served by 
&gt; HEAD, 405, 413,414, and 415?

First, you need an uri on which to perform your HEAD. Therefore you need
at least an uri list.

&gt; HEAD gives you the content-type which implies both the allowed POSTable 
&gt; types and the allowed query strings.

Suppose that the default content-type is html, to be complient with
browsers (like IE) that ask for */* (even if the purpose of your service
is to be queried by a specific client dealing with xml).
Therefore, the submission method is an html form, and thus the
content-type is www-url-encoded. How do you then specify the names and
the types of the form's fields ?

&gt; If the server does not support all the content-types, entities, and query 
&gt; strings implied by the content-type of the resource identified by the 
&gt; target URI, it can return the above status codes.  If the content-type of 
&gt; the target resource does not sufficiently constrain the client, choose a 
&gt; more-specific content-type.
&gt; 
&gt; The semantic web needs is better documentation of content-types.  It does

Subject:RDF Forms (sample newsletter-order-container)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
-- Mark--

here are some ideas about describing existing POST containers:

In general, there are millions of them on the Web in the form:

&lt;form action="http://www.example.org/post-container" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="foo" /&gt;
  &lt;!-- more input/textarea/select elements here --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

Besides using application/x-www-form-urlencoded as the
accepted encoding, all the various input 'fields' have to be
communicated to the processing application. As a first shot
I suggest an rf:acceptsField property in the same style as
rf:indexedBy.

So, the above POST container can be described with

&lt;rf:Container xmlns:rf="http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/"
              xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
              rdf:about="http://www.example.org/post-container"&gt;
 
&lt;rf:acceptedMediaType&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/rf:acceptedMediaType&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="http://www.example.com/foo"
rf:shortName="foo"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- others go here --&gt;
&lt;/rf:Container&gt;

To illustrate some of the issues that arise I tried to describe
the "newsletter-order-container" located at

       http://www.oasis-open.org/newsletters/action.php

(The form resides at
  http://www.oasis-open.org/newsletters/subscribe.phtml)
    

&lt;rf:Container xmlns:rf="http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/"
              xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
             
rdf:about="http://www.oasis-open.org/newsletters/action.php"&gt;
 
&lt;rf:acceptedMediaType&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/rf:acceptedMediaType&gt;

  &lt;!-- These fields are the ones that can propably be 'standardized' for
       all newsletter-order-container: --&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="http://www.newsletter.org/name"
rf:shortName="name"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="http://www.newsletter.org/email"
rf:shortName="email"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="http://www.newsletter.org/organisation"
rf:shortName="org"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- These fields are checkboxes that let the user choose what
       newsletters to order, meaning that we have to find a
       way to communicate to the application that these are
       multiple 1/0 'decisions'.  This is propbaly also common
       to all newsletter-order-container --&gt;

  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="oasis"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="cover"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="dailynews"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="xmldev"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="samldev"/&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="ebdev"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Below we have to &lt;select&gt; elements with various
       options: --&gt;

  &lt;!-- original value/label pairs:

      Corporate Management/Corporate Management (CEO, COO, President,
VP, Director)
      Systems Management/CIO/CTO/IT/IS/Systems Management
      Net Management/Internet/Intranet/Web/E-Commerce Management
      engineering/Engineering Management
      consultant/Consultant
      other/Other
   --&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="JFunction"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- original value/label pairs:

       vendor/Product Vendor
       user/User
       consultant/Consultant
       other/Other
   --&gt;
  &lt;rf:acceptsField rdf:resource="" rf:shortName="interest"/&gt;
&lt;/rf:Container&gt;

What needs to be resolved is how to communicate the possible
option values to the application and propably how to make use of
the additional information that the labels provide (e.g. when the
described container is renederd for a human user with a web browser.

Subject:web-calculus presentation at HP Labs<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Waterken Inc. recently presented the web-calculus to HP Labs in
Palo Alto, California. The talk explains how the web-calculus is
derived from existing REST theory, and highlights the advantages
of this design. The presentation generated much positive
discussion, especially amongst HP Lab's web services group.

HP Labs provided wonderful A/V support, including a video of the
presentation. The presentation video and the slides are available
for download from the Waterken Inc. site. See:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/HP2003/

The presentation is really the first work that explains the
functionality benefits that come from using the web-calculus. In
explaining these benefits, the presentation also serves as a good
primer on REST. I encourage everyone to download and view the
video.

Thanks to everyone at HP Labs who made the presentation possible.

<pre>Is their an consensus to deal with http header in url query string when
it's impossible for the client to manage them (e.g. html forms).
It could be useful if everyone use the same parameters. I propose one of
the form HttpEquiv&lt;Header&gt;, inspired by the html meta tag 
(e.g. http://host/service/resource?HttpEquivAccept=text/xml )

Hmm, perhaps that is better than having to spider the entire internet to 
find out what the entry in the phonebook actually means....
&lt;/polemics&gt;

But this is why I asked for a use case.

In practice, given a content-type for a resource, the number of e.g. 
POSTable content-types to that resource is, with a few notable exceptions 
fairly small.

And, if you are going to make the phonebook argument, why are you not 
enumerating all the content-types for which the resource can provide 
representations in response to a GET?

&gt;&gt; Exactly what purpose does this spec serve that is not already served by
&gt;&gt; HEAD, 405, 413,414, and 415?
&gt;
&gt; First, you need an uri on which to perform your HEAD. Therefore you need
&gt; at least an uri list.

Yes, you obviously need a URI.  The question is whether it make sense to 
provide the information available from the URI along with the URI itself. 
Why not provide the URI along with the resource itself?

&gt;&gt; HEAD gives you the content-type which implies both the allowed POSTable
&gt;&gt; types and the allowed query strings.
&gt;
&gt; Suppose that the default content-type is html, to be complient with
&gt; browsers (like IE) that ask for */* (even if the purpose of your service
&gt; is to be queried by a specific client dealing with xml).
&gt; Therefore, the submission method is an html form, and thus the
&gt; content-type is www-url-encoded. How do you then specify the names and
&gt; the types of the form's fields ?

A HEAD of /collection.xml returns content-type: application/shoe-orders+xml
Some research on this content-type tells you that it looks like this:
 &lt;orders&gt;
  &lt;order custId="asdsad" addrId="abc123" cartId="abc123" ccNo=".....   /&gt;
  ...
 &lt;/orders&gt;

The schema tells you which elements are required and which are optional.
Since the translation from form-encoded of these name value pairs to an 
update to this object is obvious, the content-type tells you everything you 
need to know about the form.

So now you create a form located at /form.html
it POSTs to /collection.xml

The server responds:
  201 Created
  Location: postedobjectlocation
  Content-type: text/plain

  Thank you for posting.

The end user is never directly exposed to the application/shoe-orders+xml 
type.

Note: It would be more elegant if there was a variant of multipart/mixed 
that had a types parameter which constrained the set of types allowed in 
the mix, but I am not aware of an RFC that looks like that so we are stuck 
with the above.

I disagree. your example is simple enough to make it obvious, but it is

Ok.  Give me a non-obvious case that is not an example of poor engineering

&gt; Moreover, this can't be automated. You have to look

You always need to understand the content-types (and schema) with which you 
are dealing.  RDF forms also requires you to understand schema.  The 
question is whether you need anything more (beyond the constraints of 
HTTP/1.1).  As far as understanding content-types (and schema), the effort 
on RDF forms would be better spent improving the infrastructure for 
resolving content-type names to their documentation.  Perhaps adding a url 
parameter to the content-type header designating the location of the 
documentation about the content-type would be the way to go.

&gt; And finally, this suppose that your "default" (or

The default type of *what* is text/html?  The form?  The POSTable resource? 
The entity body returned from the POST?  The point of my elucidation 
(copied below) is that browser based form interaction never actually 
require a GET of a POSTable resource, so it can be whatever type you want. 
My general point is that that type should provide enough information for 
form-designers and other client-side developers to understand how to 
interact with the resource.

There's a middle ground here.  It's not perfectly RESTful, but is more
so than the everything-with-POST approach.  And what's making it
unRESTful is HTTP's lack of mandatory extensions (at least I think
that's the only thing).

A PUT would look like this;

POST /moby HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/not-echo+xml
Action: http://some-pie-uri.example.org/intent/put

&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;entry&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;author&gt;&lt;name&gt;Herman Melville&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;created&gt;1851-10-18T02:00:00Z&lt;/created&gt;
 &lt;content type='text/plain'&gt;Call me Ishmael.&lt;/content&gt;
 &lt;/entry&gt;

and a "DELETE /moby" would look like this;

POST /moby HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/not-echo+xml
Action: http://some-pie-uri.example.org/intent/delete
[zero length body]

"Action" serves to identify the "extended intent" of the POST
submission.  It's the non-SOAP version of SOAPAction.

As mentioned, all that's missing for this to be fully RESTful, I
believe, is mandatory extensions.  So a more RESTful PUT-via-POST
example, using RFC 2774 which adds mandatory extensions to HTTP,
would be (though I'm *not* proposing this);

M-POST /moby HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/not-echo+xml
Man: "http://some-pie-uri.example.org/pie-ns/"; ns=1
1-Action: http://some-pie-uri.example.org/intent/put

&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;entry&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;author&gt;&lt;name&gt;Herman Melville&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;created&gt;1851-10-18T02:00:00Z&lt;/created&gt;
 &lt;content type='text/plain'&gt;Call me Ishmael.&lt;/content&gt;
 &lt;/entry&gt;

I'd still like to be able to use PUT and DELETE though.  But doing
this in addition would seem to address the concerns of the folks who
are concerned about the lack of widespread support for PUT and
DELETE.

&gt; Ok.  Give me a non-obvious case that is not an example of poor engineering 
&gt; and that cannot be refactored to be simple enough to be obvious.

as the use of html forms imply the use of an html browser as a GUI, and
not a custom client, the client can't deal with many http headers (e.g.
changing Accept on the fly, conditional GET, other methods than
post/get. This is browser poor engineering, not service. But to deal
with these problems, the simplest solution is to add params in the query
part that are not directly related to the content (data) of the
resource. (see my HttpEquiv... proposal). Thus, if your service use such
a trick, theses params are not implies by the "schema" of your type. In
addition, all your argumentation suppose that the type *has* a schema
and is validable... which in not alway true either. 

&gt; &gt; Moreover, this can't be automated. You have to look
&gt; &gt; for this schema.

&gt; resolving content-type names to their documentation.  Perhaps adding a url 
&gt; parameter to the content-type header designating the location of the 
&gt; documentation about the content-type would be the way to go.

If such an url is included in the header, I agree for this argument. But
in the current situation, the name of the MIME type is not enough, and
it's all that you can obtain from the service. As you can't modify the
MIME standard, the solution would be a Meta-Content header, but this
discussion is an other problem, already debated here. Moreover, an
rf-like document allow to use a *unique* language to describe the form.
What is the language of your schema ? if it's the content is not xml ...
Such a unique format (joined with the discovery it implies, contrary tto
MIME that don't say where to find the format definition, when it even
exists) allow full automation e.g. on the fly form generation... 

&gt; &gt; And finally, this suppose that your "default" (or
&gt; &gt; "main") type is application/shoe-order+xml, and I precised that is this
&gt; &gt; example case, default is text/html and the server can return many
&gt; &gt; formats, thanks to, e.g. , server-side xslt, so there is *no* "main"
&gt; &gt; type.
&gt; 
&gt; The default type of *what* is text/html?  The form?  The POSTable resource? 

The postable resource, which is what is interesting here. Suppose you
have an url to an article. the default type of the get is html. you can
post comments to that article. Explain me how you deal with that...
The type return by the head is html. there is no schema for the post
content. You can't POST to an other uri, because you would loose the
meaning of the post. 

&gt; The entity body returned from the POST?  The point of my elucidation 
&gt; (copied below) is that browser based form interaction never actually 
&gt; require a GET of a POSTable resource, so it can be whatever type you want. 
&gt; My general point is that that type should provide enough information for 
&gt; form-designers and other client-side developers to understand how to 
&gt; interact with the resource.

Urrgghhh... Fwiw it's still a lot better that a recent and nasty

I know you said to me once that it's not a fundamental problem that 
HTML forms don't support DELETE and PUT. But the workarounds such as 
yours leaves me deeply unconvinced - I think the HTML designers and 
the W3C set a very bad precedent and a lot of the goofy thinking 
around SOAP uber POST can be seen as coming from that precedent.

I'm working on a reliable delivery exchange over HTTP and I'm 
running into similar problems as CarrotVsOrange. My take on that 
debate is that RSS justifies using the full HTTP method set and 
working around is shortsighted - it's not just that current lack of 
widespread support for DELETE and PUT isn't a good technical 
argument, but for RSS it's a not a good expedient argument either, 
since RSS is not anywhere like as dependent on HTML forms or 
browsers as CGI type technology was.

Mark,

True, but you only need extensions in this case to workaround the 
clients. The core problem is at the client, not HTTP, which has all 
the methods we need to get the job done already.

Nonetheless, thanks for this. I'm going to have a crack at

I think RDF Schema can help there.  You could, for example,
define a collection which includes your allowable values, then
declare the property to have a rdfs:domain of that collection.

We're doing that on a project I'm working on, anyhow.

It's a formalization of a problem I keep running into with WS and 
HTTP inter-administrative integrations. For my money, once you can 
reliably transfer documents using client-server HTTP, a considerable 
number of unneccesary WS specs can be canned.


&gt; For example, what do you mean by "reliable delivery exchange"?

Once and only once delivery, on a pure client-server HTTP model, no 
extensions a la WebDAV/HTTPR, based on the five packet handshake 
protocol (parties exchange a token to begin with), state inspectable 
  by third parties.

But truthfully, in a commercial setting, I mean this - if it doesn't 
get from A to B, just once, my ass is on the line. The purpose of 
the protocol is to fulfil a business need at a low cost. Most of the 
customers I work with are concerned about being locked-in to magic 
black boxes, so opening the protocol is important in that respect.

Paul Prescod wrote up a great one pager on this a few years back on 
a model where the client and server exchange a URI token, and a lot 
of my understanding on what you can and can't do regarding reliable 
communications on the Internet came from Miles Sabin. I think you 
need a wee bit more than Paul outlined, but a hell of a lot less 
than any of the reliable-over-HTTP protocols I've seen.

It's not baked yet, the main issues are what resource the URI token 
names (I think it's the exchange and not the message) and the 
PUT/DELETE debacle (well, I think it's a debacle :)

I implemented something recently that used Apache CGI to do it's own 
hand-rolled Basic auth.  A trick that you can use to get Apache to 
supply a Authorization header to CGI scripts is to use these 
directives in a .htaccess file:

  RewriteEngine on 
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:authorization} (.*) 
  RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1] 

Is there any other reason that you need to use a different name?  
Remember that the "Authorization" header has special semantics in 
section 14.8 - shared caches may not cache the replies to requests 
that were sent with this header, unless arrangements are made to 
specifically make them cacheable.

You say a web service is a command interface for "pushing" commands.
I think it more accurate to say it is an interface for "pushing" state.
Moreover, the lambda calculus is theoretically incompatible with state
change, requiring Monads as a separate path to describe state change --
calculations and commands being considerably different (see e.g.
&lt;http://www.research.avayalabs.com/user/wadler/papers/monadsdeclare/monadsdeclare.ps&gt;).

Perhaps I am not understanding Web Calculus, but, based on this

&gt; You say a web service is a command interface for "pushing" commands.

Could you clarify, perhaps with an example?

&gt; Moreover, the lambda calculus is theoretically incompatible with state

Certainly Church's lambda-calculus did not have state change, but
many of the languages based on the lambda-calculus have
incorporated side-effects. When the presentation uses the term
lambda, it is using the term in much the same way as it is used in
Lisp.  Each node in the graph is a closure. The HTTP POST verb is
then understood to mean "apply".

Also note that the web-calculus is just an interface model, not a
computation model. The model used on the server to represent state
change is not relevant to the web-calculus. The web-calculus is
solely concerned with the interface the server exposes to the
client, just as REST is. Given this limitation, we are only
concerned with the interface aspects of the lambda-calculus,
namely applying arguments to an anonymous closure. In HTTP terms,
POSTing to a resource identified only by a URL.

As further explained in the presentation, the web-calculus then
extends the lambda-calculus model by incorporating graph
introspection, or GET in HTTP terms.

&gt; Perhaps I am not understanding Web Calculus, but, based on this
&gt; presentation, it strikes me as inconsistent with ReST, MoST, and the lambda
&gt; calculus.  Perhaps you can clarify.

I suggest viewing the video. I am working on a paper based on the
video, but it is not ready yet. Of course, there is also the
web-calculus specification itself. See:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/

In the presentation, I show how the web-calculus is defined,
starting from REST's constraints. Definition of the web-calculus
proceeds by adding constraints. This process yields a model that
is compatible with REST, as the end product necessarily conforms
to REST's constraints.

Subject:is this okay?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I am reworking my little blog program such that it will now generate actual
static files that can be served directly by Apache.  For those of you aware
of Sam Ruby's Mombo, my program will work in a similar way.  Now, here's the
issue...

When a request is made for a file that does not yet physically exist,
mod_rewrite is used to redirect the request through a CGI script.  The
script then generates the file and stores it.  Now, what I need to do is
also return the contents of the file back to the user.  But!  I do not want
to deal with all of the headers that Apache would normally return were the
file already in place.  So here is my thought:  once the file has been
created, return a 301 (Moved Permanently) response back to the same exact
request URL.  The browser then re-GETs the file and Apache handles the
request without any CGI intervention the second time around.  (All other
requests get handled by Apache the first time around.)

All of you have probably noticed the potential for the good ol' "infinite
loop" problem, but interestingly, both IE and Mozilla allow such a
redirection back to the URL that just got the 301 response (and I am
guessing the other 30x responses do the same).  So, technically this seems
to work.  However, does anyone see anything "bad" about this approach?  It
seems to be very simple, clean, and effective, but I thought I would ask...
just in case...

Subject:Addressing context?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

apologies if this is a bit off-topic, I am not sure how much my
question relates to
REST in general.

I am currently researching how Topic Maps and Web architecture relate
to each other.
One primary difference is addressing context: Topic Maps essentially
use two distinct
addressing contexts (to be chosen by the Topic Map author), using a
URI  as an
identifier for an abstract concept or as an identifier for 'a
document' (in the sense
of Web page).

I have understood that Web architecture is grounded in the existence
of a single,
unique addressing context (URI allways identifies resource) and
vaguely think that
I see some technical/conceptual advanteges of this, well, axiom.

The distinction can also bee seen this way: In TM-land the author of a
Topic Map
decides in what a given URI identifies, in Web-land the controling
authority
makes this decison.

My particular questions are:

- Is the idea that an authority controls the 'meaning of URI' a REST
principle or
  'just' a Web principle?

- What exactly are the technical advantages of using a unique
addressing context
  when building distributes systems based on REST? Has anybody
analized that
 in detail or can help me with some pointers?

Thanks.

Jan

I'd say the latter.  I don't recall REST talking at all about ownership,

via use" aspect of REST.

Well, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been
discussed for many many years.  Not that I'm very familiar with the
history, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or
Nelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can't be more specific.  I'm sure somebody
here who's more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.

&gt; 
&gt; I hope so! 8-)

In fact, it was rather difficult to grasp this part of Web architecture
because
we (1) really have in our bones that the *use* of a URI determines what
it
actually identifies.  IOW: the use provides addressing context.

(1) 'we': Topic Map community, but I think also a substantial portion
     of knowledge representation communities in general.

Sorry again, to raise these issues on this list. While I believe that
the 
use of names (e.g. URIs) in combination with context is the superior
choice for knowledge representation, I also understand that a
knowledge representation system can only be "on the Web" if it uses
a unique addressing context.

I am bringing this up here, because I am looking for the technical
arguments/benefits for a knowledge representation system to be
"on the Web" as much as possible and, well, I expect to get the
most qualified answers on this list.

One argument I know about is that unique addressing context enables 
intermediaries to 'add-in additional information'  because they need
not deal with any addressing ambiguity of the URIs they 'see'. (Hope
I recalled that correctly). 

Are there other arguments along these lines?



&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The distinction can also bee seen this way: In TM-land the author of a
&gt; &gt; Topic Map
&gt; &gt; decides in what a given URI identifies, in Web-land the controling
&gt; &gt; authority
&gt; &gt; makes this decison.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My particular questions are:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Is the idea that an authority controls the 'meaning of URI' a REST
&gt; &gt; principle or
&gt; &gt;   'just' a Web principle?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd say the latter.  I don't recall REST talking at all about ownership,
&gt; though it's possible some degree of that is implicit in the "meaning
&gt; via use" aspect of REST.

Mark, do you have any pointers regarding this "meaning via use"
aspect of REST?

And, uh, to me this sounds like the exact opposite to "meaning
via authoritative assignment"...?!?!?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - What exactly are the technical advantages of using a unique
&gt; &gt; addressing context
&gt; &gt;   when building distributes systems based on REST? Has anybody
&gt; &gt; analized that
&gt; &gt;  in detail or can help me with some pointers?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been
&gt; discussed for many many years.  Not that I'm very familiar with the
&gt; history, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or
&gt; Nelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can't be more specific.  I'm sure somebody
&gt; here who's more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.

Subject:REST's Definition of Resource<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Hello--

I have some questions regarding REST's definition[1] of resource:

REST (re-)defines resource to be an abstraction not only of a)
information
resources (e.g. Web pages) but also of a) services and b) abstract
concepts.
While I see a clear reason for the neccessity of b) for REST to be an
architecture suitable for distributed systems I cannot see a reason for
c). IMHO,
abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but
are
subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other
words:
subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not
part
of the architecture itself).

Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines 'resource' to
include
c) ?

The second question I have is related to the question what the
semantics of a resource are.  Roy's dissertation says:

"REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the
 semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather
 than the value corresponding to those semantics at the
 time the reference is created."

To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the
semantics of resources.  What is the precise meaning of 'author' here?
Author of a 'document' that uses a particular URI or the author that
somhow 'brings into being' a particular resource?

Thanks,

Jan

Here is another way to express my question:

I don't believe that the notion of a resource's state makes any sense
wrt abstract concepts so why would REST allow me to TRANSFER
REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STATES of cars, dogs or even believes?

While POSTing to 'presidential democracy' IMHO *obviously* makes
no sense I also have serious problems with the idea of GETing a
representation of the state of 'presidential democracy'.

So, why does REST ("REpresentational State Transfer"!) include the
notion
of abstract concepts in the definition of resource?


Somewhat confused....

Every thing (two words 8-) is a resource.  c) is automatically included
by this definition, and to remove it would be arbitrary, and would
lessen the power of the Web.

&gt; The second question I have is related to the question what the
&gt; semantics of a resource are.  Roy's dissertation says:
&gt; 
&gt; "REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the
&gt;  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather
&gt;  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the
&gt;  time the reference is created."
&gt; 
&gt; To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the
&gt; semantics of resources.

No, it's just that the document returned via GET doesn't have to be
100% unambiguous about what the URI identifies (and I suggest that it
couldn't be if it wanted to, but that's another topic for another day
8-).

For example, a URI that returned a picture of a clock in my house could
be used to identify the following resources;

- the current time
- that particular clock
- the largest clock in my house
- a JPG image of a clock
- an object located 6.5' above the floor in my kitchen

From an observer's POV, the URI could identify any of those if I'm
only ever returning an image from my webcam pointed at that clock.

&gt;  What is the precise meaning of 'author' here?
&gt; Author of a 'document' that uses a particular URI or the author that
&gt; somhow 'brings into being' a particular resource?

Any use of the URI can contribute to its meaning.  Using the clock
example, if a bunch of people used that URI to identify "the current
time", and then my clock breaks and I decide not to fix it (I'm using
it to identify "that particular clock"), then there is, in effect, an
expectation on me to change what it identifies to what most people
think it identifies.  It's up to me whether or not I want to do that,
of course.

A great example is the SOAP 1.1 URI at W3C; http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/ .
The URI should be able to be used as the identifier for "the latest
W3C version of SOAP", but so many people were using it to explicitly
refer to SOAP 1.1, rather than "SOAP in general", that the W3C made an
explicit decision not to redirect that URI to SOAP 1.2 once it went Rec.
FWIW, they did redirect for HTML; http://www.w3.org/TR/html

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jan,

The two questions are closely related.  Suppose you know I've
been renovating my house for the last 4 years, and you're interested
in that project.

Suppose I (the author) assign a URI as an identifier of the concept
"Walden's house renovation", and give you that URI.

Suppose that you use a browser or whatever to deference that URI
periodically over a span of several years.  Suppose that each time
you do so, you retrieve a different "document" in response, each one
representing at the time of dereferencing the project under study.

Note that if each document so served required its own URI, then
there would be no identity at the level of my project, only identity
of documents representing it.  That would not serve your interest in
my project as well as having an identifier that targets the project
directly.

As the "author", I assign the URI, and then manage the implementation
such that the representations all support a "sameness" of subject.  Roy
uses the word "semantic" there.

Regards,

Walden

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; &gt; &gt; - Is the idea that an authority controls the 'meaning of URI' a REST
&gt; &gt; &gt; principle or
&gt; &gt; &gt;   'just' a Web principle?

If the question is whether URIs generically have
"meaning"  outside of the context in which they
are delivered, the answer is no.

The most general URI scheme is the "data:" URI
scheme (RFC2397) which allows delivery of raw data
via URI e.g.

    data:,I%20agree%20with%20you.

Since data: URIs have no authoity but do have
meaning (via context), I think we can trivially
assert that the meaning of at least some URIs
comes from use-context rather than any authority.

If the question is whether the meaning of URIs
with authorities e.g. HTTP URIs is controlled by
those authorities, the answer is still no.
If I send you an HTTP URI that returns the
sentence "I agree with you", only context
tells you who "I" is in the sentence, not the
authority.

Alternatively, what do you mean by "meaning of a
URI"?

HTTP URIs are locators.  They have no other

&gt; &gt; abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other
&gt; &gt; words:
&gt; &gt; subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not
&gt; &gt; part
&gt; &gt; of the architecture itself).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines 'resource' to
&gt; &gt; include
&gt; &gt; c) ?
&gt; 
&gt; Every thing (two words 8-) is a resource.  c) is automatically included
&gt; by this definition, and to remove it would be arbitrary, and would
&gt; lessen the power of the Web.

I understand, though that does not really satisfy me....but that is
another
topic for another day ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The second question I have is related to the question what the
&gt; &gt; semantics of a resource are.  Roy's dissertation says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the
&gt; &gt;  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather
&gt; &gt;  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the
&gt; &gt;  time the reference is created."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the
&gt; &gt; semantics of resources.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it's just that the document returned via GET doesn't have to be
&gt; 100% unambiguous about what the URI identifies (and I suggest that it
&gt; couldn't be if it wanted to, but that's another topic for another day
&gt; 8-).
&gt; 
[...]
&gt; Any use of the URI can contribute to its meaning.  Using the clock
&gt; example, if a bunch of people used that URI to identify "the current
&gt; time", and then my clock breaks and I decide not to fix it (I'm using
&gt; it to identify "that particular clock"), then there is, in effect, an
&gt; expectation on me to change what it identifies to what most people
&gt; think it identifies.  It's up to me whether or not I want to do that,
&gt; of course.

Ah, interesting. This focusses on the collaborative aspect of the Web
and kind of makes it possible for the Semantic Web to grow while
still being "on the Web". Did I get that right?

OTH: is that documented somewhere? Why is there an ongoing
debate within RDF/SW about what certain URIs denote and what not?
(e.g. fragment-identifier-URIs pointing to Web pages etc.)

IOW: Is it *your* explanation/position? REST's position?  Is the
RDF/SW community aware of this view at all?

Jan

P.S. Really helpfull, thanks Mark!

Sorry.

Jan

&gt; If the question is whether URIs generically have
&gt; "meaning"  outside of the context in which they
&gt; are delivered, the answer is no.
&gt; 
&gt; The most general URI scheme is the "data:" URI
&gt; scheme (RFC2397) which allows delivery of raw data
&gt; via URI e.g.
&gt; 
&gt;     data:,I%20agree%20with%20you.
&gt; 
&gt; Since data: URIs have no authoity but do have
&gt; meaning (via context), I think we can trivially
&gt; assert that the meaning of at least some URIs
&gt; comes from use-context rather than any authority.
&gt; 
&gt; If the question is whether the meaning of URIs
&gt; with authorities e.g. HTTP URIs is controlled by
&gt; those authorities, the answer is still no.
&gt; If I send you an HTTP URI that returns the
&gt; sentence "I agree with you", only context
&gt; tells you who "I" is in the sentence, not the
&gt; authority.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, what do you mean by "meaning of a
&gt; URI"?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope so! 8-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In fact, it was rather difficult to grasp this part of Web architecture
&gt; &gt; because
&gt; &gt; we (1) really have in our bones that the *use* of a URI determines what
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; actually identifies.  IOW: the use provides addressing context.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (1) 'we': Topic Map community, but I think also a substantial portion
&gt; &gt;      of knowledge representation communities in general.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry again, to raise these issues on this list. While I believe that
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; use of names (e.g. URIs) in combination with context is the superior
&gt; &gt; choice for knowledge representation, I also understand that a
&gt; &gt; knowledge representation system can only be "on the Web" if it uses
&gt; &gt; a unique addressing context.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am bringing this up here, because I am looking for the technical
&gt; &gt; arguments/benefits for a knowledge representation system to be
&gt; &gt; "on the Web" as much as possible and, well, I expect to get the
&gt; &gt; most qualified answers on this list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One argument I know about is that unique addressing context enables
&gt; &gt; intermediaries to 'add-in additional information'  because they need
&gt; &gt; not deal with any addressing ambiguity of the URIs they 'see'. (Hope
&gt; &gt; I recalled that correctly).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are there other arguments along these lines?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The distinction can also bee seen this way: In TM-land the author of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Topic Map
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides in what a given URI identifies, in Web-land the controling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; authority
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes this decison.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My particular questions are:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Is the idea that an authority controls the 'meaning of URI' a REST
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principle or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   'just' a Web principle?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd say the latter.  I don't recall REST talking at all about ownership,
&gt; &gt; &gt; though it's possible some degree of that is implicit in the "meaning
&gt; &gt; &gt; via use" aspect of REST.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mark, do you have any pointers regarding this "meaning via use"
&gt; &gt; aspect of REST?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And, uh, to me this sounds like the exact opposite to "meaning
&gt; &gt; via authoritative assignment"...?!?!?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - What exactly are the technical advantages of using a unique
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressing context
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   when building distributes systems based on REST? Has anybody
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analized that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  in detail or can help me with some pointers?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed for many many years.  Not that I'm very familiar with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; history, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can't be more specific.  I'm sure somebody
&gt; &gt; &gt; here who's more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>alex,

that may be what the http spec says, but i don't believe
that's up-to-date with the thinking that's currently going
on in the web architecture area, in which uri are *identifiers*
primarily and may also be locators, names or whatever.

identity is a key principle here, not to be eclipsed by
something you may have found in the letters of the http
spec, the language of which is not always the most fortunate
from the architecture perspective.

since the nature of Jan's question was in the REST domain,
not in the HTTP domain, if we must split hairs, then I feel
an architecturally scoped answer is more appropriate than
a purely HTTP protocol scoped answer.  But we can let Jan
decide that.

Walden

I think so.  I like the way you phrased that, as if this were a feature
rather than a bug.  Nice.

Not AFAICT.

&gt; Why is there an ongoing
&gt; debate within RDF/SW about what certain URIs denote and what not?

I don't think there's any one answer to that, unfortunately.
Everybody sees things slightly differently.

&gt; IOW: Is it *your* explanation/position? REST's position?  Is the
&gt; RDF/SW community aware of this view at all?

It's mine, and I believe it to be in synch with Roy's, but I don't
think REST-the-architectural-style talks about it.  I figure it's an
emergent property of REST, or any style in which identifiers can be
late bound to representations (i.e. pretty much every large scale
system around).

Yes, the SW community is aware of this view.  The whole "public meaning"
discussion is about it, and many involved seem to also see things this
way, at least in part.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>It depends on the scheme.

HTTP URIs identify locations at which data may be
retrieved/deposited.

MD5 URIs identify data that may be located at some HTTP URI
at some point in time.

DATA URIs identify the data contained therein, data that may be
located at particular HTTP URI at some point in time and
identified by an MD5 URI at all times.

ReST is about the value of using HTTP URIs as they were intended,
as resource location identifiers, rather than as channels for
communication with RPC servers.

If current thinking is that HTTP URIs designate anything
other than a location, more thinking is probably required.

<pre>Alex,

I think it would be incorrect, even for HTTP scheme, to assert
that the location is necessarily the resource.

REST says resources are anything with identity, and that URI
are identifiers for them.  Period.  HTTP and other specifications
may say what they will about locations, et cetera.

What is your statement below "ReST is about..." based on?  It
sounds to me like your own interpretation, which seems to favor
a dogmatic adherence to the letter of RFC 2616, rather than
an attempt to understand what's written in the REST thesis or
other ongoing efforts to define web architecture.

<pre>I've written a new paper: "Powerful Web Services Through
Composition".  The paper's description is:

"This document shows how the web-calculus is derived from the
REST architectural model that underlies the World Wide Web (WWW).
The advantages of this approach to web services are highlighted."

The paper covers the material from my presentation at HP Labs a
few weeks ago. The paper and the talk explain why the web-calculus
is a good approach to web services.

I hope this paper will better communicate why I am working on the
web-calculus, and encourage others to as well.

I am thinking of submitting this paper to CACM, so I look forward
to any feedback.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; I think it would be incorrect, even for HTTP scheme, to assert
&gt; that the location is necessarily the resource.

There is only one HTTP URI scheme, the HTTP
Uniform Resource Locator as defined in (rfc2616).

I would agree that server operators *should* avoid
changing what resources are found via particular
URLs but I think it is a mistake to say that they
are guaranteed to do so -- there are way too many
404s found via Google.  Would you sign a
contract that requires you to abide by the terms
of a document "identified" by a URL you don't
control?

Applied to HTTP, ReST stlye is about transferring
representations of the state of resources found
via HTTP URL's rather than e.g. transferring
representations of procedure calls to and
return-values from RPC servers.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Alex,

I don't know where you are going with this, but it
doesn't sound like REST to me.  I think it's now pretty
far afield of Jan's question, and likely to be of no
value to continue.

Summary:

REST (re-) defines resources to include abstract
concepts because users of the system sometimes find
identity in abstraction.  In other words, they want it
to be that way.  They want the level of indirection and
late binding that allows representations to track a
single concept over time.  'Resource' is just the name
of a relationship that binds those representations into
single identity, the thing of interest.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt; I don't believe that the notion of a resource's state makes any sense
&gt; wrt abstract concepts so why would REST allow me to TRANSFER
&gt; REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STATES of cars, dogs or even believes?

How do you think about abstract concepts like "3"?  Do you think of
it symbolically (the glyph) or numerically?  If you need to explain
to someone the algorithm for calculating the area of a circle, how
do you do that?  Those are all representations.

&gt; While POSTing to 'presidential democracy' IMHO *obviously* makes
&gt; no sense I also have serious problems with the idea of GETing a
&gt; representation of the state of 'presidential democracy'.

Then don't provide one.  There is no requirement that all resources
have representations.

&gt; So, why does REST ("REpresentational State Transfer"!) include the
&gt; notion of abstract concepts in the definition of resource?

Because they are resources.

<pre>Please bear with me....I get the impression that
there are a number of implicit ideas about REST that
I have been completely missing so far.

More questions....


I actually thought that REST is 'purely technical', an architecture
for distributed systems. (in that sense, for example, directly
comparable to Corba).

OTH, what Roy said in his last reply suggests that REST is also
considered with knowledge representation issues. Is that correct?


If so:
A fundamental concept in knowledge representation is to provide
surrogates for real-world subjects in order to provide 'electronic
handles' for making assertions about the real-world things. Is
this thinking within the realm of REST itself?

If so:
Are URIs intended to be these surrogates?


Might seem like an awkward way to approach this, but it will
help me understand.

Thanks.

What I mean is if REST goes beyond the technical aspects of distributed
systems?

If REST is only about the technical aspects (e.g. how messages are
transferred, how interfaces are contrained) then what Roy writes is
IMHO outside the scope of REST. 

Put in another way: in what sense is what Roy writes relevant for
an architectural style for distributed systems?

To mw, what Roy says, are aspects of a possible application of REST
but not REST itself.

So, what am I missing?

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST's Definition of Resource<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jan,

I don't think it would ever be correct to say that "REST [or
any architectural style, for that matter] is only about the technical
aspects...".  The purpose of studying architectural styles is so
that we can reason about the properties of the system.

In this case, there are two properties driving the definition of
"resource" within the REST style:

(1) consistency of reference.  When you say "GET the algorithm
for computing the area of a circle" or "GET the current weather
in Norwalk", you want those requests to have consistent semantics
over time.  Even if the particular answers vary.

(2) scaleability.  One way to achieve that consistency is to let
identifiers identify representations, and rely on centralized link services
to
track state changes.  Every time the current weather in Norwalk
changed, a new document and a new identifier would have to be
minted, and all existing documents with a reference to Norwalk
weather would need their links updated, the overall cost of the operation
being commensurate with the total number of such links.  The other,
more scaleable, way to achieve that is to do what REST does:

"""
Traditional hypertext systems [61], which typically operate in a closed or
local environment, use unique node or document identifiers that change every
time the information changes, relying on link servers to maintain references
separately from the content [135]. Since centralized link servers are an
anathema to the immense scale and multi-organizational domain requirements
of the Web, REST relies instead on the author choosing a resource identifier
that best fits the nature of the concept being identified. Naturally, the
quality of an identifier is often proportional to the amount of money spent
to retain its validity, which leads to broken links as ephemeral (or poorly
supported) information moves or disappears over time.
"""

I don't think REST seeks to be a framework for knowledge
representation or semantics.  I think the requirements above led
to its definition being inevitably "conceptual".

REST "resource" is unlike any other architectural component
I am aware of in this sense.  A "filter" component in a pipe &amp;
filter style makes promises about the consistency and relative
statelessness of the transform, but not any semantic consistency
of the output.

In modeling REST formally, you can remove "resource" from
the picture without harming the purely technical aspects of the
system.  What you then end up with is a many-to-many relation
from URI to representations.  Perhaps that's all the Web *really*
is, but it's hard to find any guidance in the building of useful
systems in that.  Put another way, it's hard to decide what value
such a system might be providing.

Interesting topic.

Walden

Hmm, I see some light I think.

Do you argue that resource is (re-) defined the way it is
on the basis of *observation*? 

To put this in other words: *Because* users are using URIs to
identify abstract concepts REST defines resource to include them?

Yet other words: The definition of resource is the result of
observation and not the result of, uhh, the process of 'engineering'
REST?  An *observation* not a *design decision*?

That would clarify a *lot*.


What I have allways thought is that keeping the unique addressing context
*forced* REST to include abstract concepts in the definition of resource
(*although* this is really awkward from the knowledge representation POV [1])


Jan

[1] Because it is the cause for the URI/meaning etc. trouble. 
    (To be clear: I am not trying to criticise REST, I am trying to
     understand its origin and implications)





&gt; 'Resource' is just the name
&gt; of a relationship that binds those representations into

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST's Definition of Resource (fwd)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jan,

HTTP says that URLs are simply addresses for resources.

REST is an architectural style in which each URL maps to a the current
instances of the some concept e.g. the current issue of the newspaper or
the current state of Walden's house, or the October 1, 2003 issue of the
newspaper (this is the current instance of the 10/1/2003 newspaper).

Of course since the content varies, this begs the question of how you as
the user of such a resource know what concept is being instantiated and
represented at a particular URL.  And the answer is the communication
context in which the URL was delivered.

Roy's paper is relatively silent on this communication context other than
to say that it is supplied by the world wide web.

Personally, I prefer to collapse this division and view URLs in terms of a
set of commitments other parties make about the content available at a
resource and their abilities to uphold those commitments.  I prefer to
think of content located by a URLs as being the result of some party's PUT,
POST, or DELETE and avoid the trap into which many REST oriented developers
fall of exposing hidden representations

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Thanks for your answers, I am still digesting them.

However, I think I need to ask some more practical questions:


Suppose the HTML snippet:

&lt;p&gt;
  Professor &lt;a href="http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/pages/svenonius.html"&gt;
  Elaine Svenonious&lt;/a&gt; is the author of several papers, ....
&lt;/p&gt;


Is REST's interpretation of this snippet that the author uses the URI to
identify a resource that 'is' the person Elaine Svenonious?

And that the author's intention is *not* to identify a resource that 'is'
the Web page.

&gt; I don't think it would ever be correct to say that "REST [or
&gt; any architectural style, for that matter] is only about the technical
&gt; aspects...".  The purpose of studying architectural styles is so
&gt; that we can reason about the properties of the system.
&gt;
&gt; In this case, there are two properties driving the definition of
&gt; "resource" within the REST style:
&gt;
&gt; (1) consistency of reference.  When you say "GET the algorithm
&gt; for computing the area of a circle" or "GET the current weather
&gt; in Norwalk", you want those requests to have consistent semantics
&gt; over time.  Even if the particular answers vary.
&gt;
&gt; (2) scaleability.  One way to achieve that consistency is to let
&gt; identifiers identify representations, and rely on centralized link
&gt; services to
&gt; track state changes.  Every time the current weather in Norwalk
&gt; changed, a new document and a new identifier would have to be
&gt; minted, and all existing documents with a reference to Norwalk
&gt; weather would need their links updated, the overall cost of the 
&gt; operation
&gt; being commensurate with the total number of such links.  The other,
&gt; more scaleable, way to achieve that is to do what REST does:
&gt;
&gt; """
&gt; Traditional hypertext systems [61], which typically operate in a 
&gt; closed or
&gt; local environment, use unique node or document identifiers that change 
&gt; every
&gt; time the information changes, relying on link servers to maintain 
&gt; references
&gt; separately from the content [135]. Since centralized link servers are 
&gt; an
&gt; anathema to the immense scale and multi-organizational domain 
&gt; requirements
&gt; of the Web, REST relies instead on the author choosing a resource 
&gt; identifier
&gt; that best fits the nature of the concept being identified. Naturally, 
&gt; the
&gt; quality of an identifier is often proportional to the amount of money 
&gt; spent
&gt; to retain its validity, which leads to broken links as ephemeral (or 
&gt; poorly
&gt; supported) information moves or disappears over time.
&gt; """
&gt;
&gt; I don't think REST seeks to be a framework for knowledge
&gt; representation or semantics.  I think the requirements above led
&gt; to its definition being inevitably "conceptual".

That's an excellent summary, Walden.  REST does not seek to be a
framework for KR, but it is a framework for communication.  The KR
systems that I am familiar with are primarily based on models of
facts/claims/reality instead of perceptions, since building a
reasoning system with multiple perspectives is a bit like
working with a schizophrenic.  However, since communication is
at the heart of learning, they end up with similar challenges.
and similar terminology.

&gt; REST "resource" is unlike any other architectural component
&gt; I am aware of in this sense.  A "filter" component in a pipe &amp;
&gt; filter style makes promises about the consistency and relative
&gt; statelessness of the transform, but not any semantic consistency
&gt; of the output.

Yep, I struggled with that in writing the dissertation -- is
each resource a datum, a connector, a component, or something
else that just hasn't been talked about in the literature?
I think of it as an abstract goal, more than anything else,
but classified it as data because it didn't fit elsewhere.
It is, essentially, data that is only used by reference.

&gt; In modeling REST formally, you can remove "resource" from
&gt; the picture without harming the purely technical aspects of the
&gt; system.  What you then end up with is a many-to-many relation
&gt; from URI to representations.  Perhaps that's all the Web *really*
&gt; is, but it's hard to find any guidance in the building of useful
&gt; systems in that.  Put another way, it's hard to decide what value
&gt; such a system might be providing.

And that is the key, really, since the main reason we know that a
conceptual resource must exist is because of the number of ways
that a link can fail.  It is only when people complain bitterly
about the lack of an expected sameness that you realize the goal
of the link has nothing to do with the listener at the end of
the HTTP address, but rather the expectation that it identifies
(indirectly, as there is no such thing as direct HTTP
identification) something other than the address.

People don't create links to server software; they create links to
information.  If the system pretends that the target of a link is
nothing more than a communication point, then the system cannot
anticipate and correct for the kinds of information failures that
people actually care about.  Or, more to the point, people won't
design the system (which doesn't care either way) such that it
detects such failures when possible and includes the features
necessary for indirection, redirection, etc.

BTW, the definition of resource in REST applies only to information
systems.  The one that applies to all uses of URI is in the
rfc2396bis draft, which has larger scope but ends up being less
useful as a result.  There are no other generally agreed upon
definitions of resource for the Web technologies, though many people
still think of it as a "document" and simply change the definition
of document to have the same properties as a resource.

&gt; the Web page.

REST is an architectural style, not an interpreter.  REST-based
components will see the anchor reference (which gives meaning),
extract the reference, obtain the URI from that reference, and
perform a retrieval action (implied by the anchor tag, not by the
URI).  What exactly the URI identifies is not relevant to the client,
since it only follows the rules of interaction called for by the
protocols.

The origin server, if a request gets that far, receives a request and
maps it to a response, using however complicated or slow a process it
might desire.  To be Turing-like, you might even place a person on
the back end that does a manual mapping for each request.  However,
for efficiency reasons, the mappings are typically arranged in advance.

REST does not define how the mapping works, and thus cannot say one
way or the other as to the URI coiner's intention.  It does know that
whether the URI identifies the person or not is irrelevant to the
meaning and nature of a successful response to the request, which
in all cases is a representation.  A "Web page" is actually a
construct of one or more representations as rendered by the client,
and thus is never directly identified by a URI (the first URI is
merely a starting point from which my home page is constructed as
a sequence of interactions, depending on the client configuration).

We have no way of knowing whether the URI, as used by the author,
is intended to identify the person, their home page, or some other
aspect of past responses that the author simply had no other URI
to reference.  That's why it is useful to look at the text inside
the anchor, both here and in other authors' use of the URI, and
any other metadata that might be laying about.

Why does REST'allow' the interpretation that the author uses the URI to
identify a resource that 'is' the person Elaine Svenonious?




The person "Elaine Svenonious" is not directly addressable (in the sense that it
does not have a location) and allowing a URI to identify it implies (IMHO) the
use of URIs as names (which I thought was purely an RDF/Semantic Web issue).


Hmm, propably my non-understanding can also be expressed like this:
How can an architectural style for distributed systems use object references
(here URIs) as object references AND names for abstract concepts?

[You just cannot reference an asbtract concept directly, you can only refer
to it by name.]

So it is true that an author's use of a URI provides a context that
affects what resource the URI is actually intended to identify, yes?

So, a single URI can in fact identify several different resources
(depending on the URI-user's intention). Did I get that right?

Roy, hat is the meaning of 'author' in what you write? Is it

- the person that 'issued' the URI in the first place ("naming authority")


- or the person that used the URI as the value of the href attribute?

An opportunity for some extreme, and perhaps useful, irony has
presented itself in this last question of yours.  (I wonder, though, how
much this really has to do with REST.)

Did you realize that you used the word "hat" where you probably
meant to use the word "what"?

What did you mean to identify with that word (or should I say "hat
were you trying to identify..."?).  Does the context of that sentence
affect the *architecture* of the English language?

I like this question.  You should clarify one aspect of it, though.
Do you mean that (say, over a given time period) GET(URI1) *always*
yields Representation1, and likewise for URI2/Representation2?
Or do you  mean that via observation, we have just seen the scenario
below played out once?

You are asking questions of the nature What may two people claim?

Well, to keep it simple(?), let's stick to the "always" scenario.

&gt; You are asking questions of the nature What may two people claim?
&gt; and What allows knowledge?  Are these the questions you mean to
&gt; ask, or do you mean to ask questions about the constraints in REST?

Well, a bit of both, really.  The first bit has to do with whether a single
client can know the commonality of two URIs that point to the same resource.
For example, there is this resource somewhere and it has two URIs
referencing it.  How can a client assert that these two URIs reference a
single resource?  It seems to me that the answer is you can't necessarily
know.  It is possible, though, that the semantics of a particular
representation (e.g. RDF document) could allow such understanding, but that
would be specific to that resource and not generally applicable to all
resources.  In other words, each resource would have to explicitly tell the
client in a potentially proprietary way of the relationship of its URIs.
But there isn't anything at a more generic level (say HTTP, for instance)
that allows this to be known.

The other part is whether it is possible for two clients to assert that they
talking about the same single resource if neither of them share an
identifier (URI).  It seems to me that they cannot.  Period.  Which gets me
back to the first question... if a single client does not have a mechanism
to find that two different URIs are of the same resource, then it is in the
same seat as the two clients that do not share a resource.

Now, maybe this is beyond the scope of REST.  I really don't know.  Or maybe
the problem here is that HTTP's implementation of REST is not complete in
this matter.  Or maybe this is a red herring that's just confusing issues
(no, I really don't know if it is or not).

&gt; 
&gt; An opportunity for some extreme, and perhaps useful, irony has
&gt; presented itself in this last question of yours.  (I wonder, though, how
&gt; much this really has to do with REST.)
&gt; 
&gt; Did you realize that you used the word "hat" where you probably
&gt; meant to use the word "what"?

Yes, I meant "what" sorry about that.

&gt; 
&gt; What did you mean to identify with that word (or should I say "hat
&gt; were you trying to identify..."?).  Does the context of that sentence
&gt; affect the *architecture* of the English language?

I tried, but I admit that I don't get what you are up to. Is this an
analogy I don't get?

: From: "Walden Mathews" &lt;waldenm@...&gt;
: &gt;
: &gt; I like this question.  You should clarify one aspect of it, though.
: &gt; Do you mean that (say, over a given time period) GET(URI1) *always*
: &gt; yields Representation1, and likewise for URI2/Representation2?
: &gt; Or do you  mean that via observation, we have just seen the scenario
: &gt; below played out once?
:
: Well, to keep it simple(?), let's stick to the "always" scenario.

My take is that two identifiers that consistently yield different
representations, sans any other meta-data affecting the format
of representation requested, identify different things.
:
: &gt; You are asking questions of the nature What may two people claim?
: &gt; and What allows knowledge?  Are these the questions you mean to
: &gt; ask, or do you mean to ask questions about the constraints in REST?
:
: Well, a bit of both, really.  The first bit has to do with whether a
single
: client can know the commonality of two URIs that point to the same
resource.
: For example, there is this resource somewhere and it has two URIs
: referencing it.  How can a client assert that these two URIs reference a
: single resource?  It seems to me that the answer is you can't necessarily
: know.  It is possible, though, that the semantics of a particular
: representation (e.g. RDF document) could allow such understanding, but
that
: would be specific to that resource and not generally applicable to all
: resources.  In other words, each resource would have to explicitly tell
the
: client in a potentially proprietary way of the relationship of its URIs.
: But there isn't anything at a more generic level (say HTTP, for instance)
: that allows this to be known.

Maybe no strict format for it called out in HTTP, but HTTP is hypertext
transfer protocol, and hypertext is a suitable medium for setting
expectations of the kind described above, isn't it?

:
: The other part is whether it is possible for two clients to assert that
they
: talking about the same single resource if neither of them share an
: identifier (URI).  It seems to me that they cannot.  Period.  Which gets
me
: back to the first question... if a single client does not have a mechanism
: to find that two different URIs are of the same resource, then it is in
the
: same seat as the two clients that do not share a resource.

You mean two clients are having a conversation; they think they're
talking about the same resource, but when they exchange identifiers, it
turns out that client A's identifiers are disjoint from client B's
identifiers?
So then, they can't know they're talking about the same resouce; and
yet they seem to be?

Well, you puzzle it out, but if two parties agree that they are talking
about a single thing, there's at least one identifier in that picture.
Maybe
it's just not a URI.

What is your goal in these questions?

I guess I don't see the relation between a "typo" ("hat" for "what") and
questioning what Roy meant by the word "author" is in a sentence.

That is, by "author" do we mean the "coiner" of the URI, who inserts that
data into a document, or the "issuing authority" of the URI, that serves
up a representation of the resource identified by that the URI (in
context). Both? Some third meanning?

Walden, are you saying the question is meaningless and cannot be asked, at
least within the context of a REST architectural discussion?

That the word "author" is a typo for some other correct word?

<pre>Jan,

You were asking "What allows this URI, embedded in this context,
to identify a person as opposed to a string of bits?" [paraphrased].

By analogy, what allowed the typo "hat" in your previous message to
identify the concept "what" when I first read it?

More to the point, what does the above question have to do with
the architectural style of the system in which the phenomenon occurred?
I'm not sure I know the answer; if you don't either, then I'd say we're
stuck.

I don't either.  Jan was asking what allowed a given URI in a given
context to identify a *person*, as opposed to a more expected
consequence, like identifying a document.  My point was simply that
even defective identifiers sometimes work well, provided a supportive
enough context. You know, it begs the question: What allows identifiers
to work at all?  And then: Is REST doing/promising something other
than the usual in that department?  I don't think so.

No.  BTW, I think when Roy said "author", he was referring to the

There are two subjects:

A: the abstract concept of the Person "Elaine Svenonious"
B: the 'document'  (it's abstract notion, not the bits and bytes of course)

There are two Resources representing these subjects:

S_A: the resource representing subject A
S_B: the resource representing subject B


The URI http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/pages/svenonius.html
can be an identifier for either one of the subjects, depending on the
URI-users (the one authoring the href attribute) intention.

Is that correct?


Bottom line: a single URI can identify several resources.

Correct?

Sounds wrong to me.  The context an author may create around
an identifier (a URI) does not affect the mapping of representations,
which is where the consistency needs to be perceived, and hence
the notion of identity observed

No.  The word is not " identify".  It might be connote.  I'm not

<pre>&gt;&gt; Suppose the HTML snippet:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Professor &lt;a 
&gt;&gt; href="http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/pages/svenonius.html"&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Elaine Svenonious&lt;/a&gt; is the author of several papers, ....
&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why does REST 'allow' the interpretation that the author uses the URI 
&gt; to
&gt; identify a resource that 'is' the person Elaine Svenonious?

Because REST doesn't interpret hypertext -- people do.

&gt; The person "Elaine Svenonious" is not directly addressable (in the 
&gt; sense
&gt; that it
&gt; does not have a location) and allowing a URI to identify it implies 
&gt; (IMHO) the
&gt; use of URIs as names (which I thought was purely an RDF/Semantic Web 
&gt; issue).

No.  All URIs are names.  Some URIs also contain what might be viewed as
an address involving multiple indirect mappings, and very few URIs
contain a directly addressed maping (e.g., file://127.0.0.1/).
"http" URIs, in particular, have at least one mandatory indirect
mapping, which makes them capable of referencing any concept.

&gt; Hmm, propably my non-understanding can also be expressed like this:
&gt; How can an architectural style for distributed systems use object 
&gt; references
&gt; (here URIs) as object references AND names for abstract concepts?

Because they are not object references -- they reference resources.
BTW, it is a style for network-based systems -- "distributed" means
something else.

&gt; [You just cannot reference an asbtract concept directly, you can only 
&gt; refer
&gt; to it by name.]

You cannot access an HTTP-based resource directly, either.

&gt; So it is true that an author's use of a URI provides a context that

No.  It affects the result of identifying the resource, and that in turn
affects how people using that URI perceive it as identifying.  But, what
it actually identifies is unknown to the link author, unless they happen
to know by some other method (e.g., being the owner, asking the owner,
etc.).  People generally just follow the leader and assume that what
one person thinks it identifies is what they think it identifies.

&gt; So, a single URI can in fact identify several different resources
&gt; (depending on the URI-user's intention). Did I get that right?

A single URI can be used to indirectly identify multiple resources,
even though it only directly identifies whatever the maintainer of
that mapping wishes to maintain.

By author I meant "link maker", not resource owner.

Usually, nothing at all, though it is possible to find out by examining

That is true even if R1 is never equal to R2, since representations
do not need to be similar.  However, it is true that the resource

even when the sole characteristic of the resource is that it be random.

Roy, what exactly do you mean by "indirectly identify"?




Given the definition of 'resource' beeing a mapping from URI to a set of
representations I read your answer to mean that 

   
    A single URI can be used to indirectly identify multiple mappings
    from that URI to sets of representations.


Did I get that right?





Appologies for being so difficult, but I seem to be missing a critical
piece of the whole idea.

<pre>Jan,

: 

I just want to correct one seemingly trivial mistake in the above: the
resource is not a mapping from URI to representations.  If it were, then
you could only have one URI identifying a resource.  The mapping
is from time to representations.  That's a little harder to grasp, but it
looks like this:

TIME    REPRESENTATION
t1          r1
t1          r2
t2          r1
t2          r2
t2          r3
t3          (null)
t4          r2

etc.

What you are seeing above is a "resource".  You can mint as many
URI as you  please to name it.

Formally:
sig Resource {map: Time-&gt;Representation}
sig URI {identifies: Resource}

E.g.: Two URI on the same Resource:
u1, u2: URI | u1.identifies = u2.identifies
    =&gt; "every t-&gt;r tuple found vi u1 is also found via u2,
            and vice versa"

<pre>Roy,

I'm not sure what an ontology question is, but I was wondering
whether *you meant* by  "a URI can identify many resources
indirectly" that

a. (my hunch) that a URI may identify a resource which references
    other resources by embedding their URI in its represnetations,
    to arbitrarily many recurses of this indirection, or

b. (probably Jan's assumption) that a URI may 'identify' a resource
    by inference, more like connotation that identification, which I
    believe is a trap I stepped into yesterday in trying to navigate
    this territory.

Would you mind just clarifying that?

Thanks,
Walden

I completely agree. I tried to keep the 'meaning' stuff out of this
discussion as much as I could - sorry if that wasn't clear.

I am asking all these question for pure practical reasons (see below).

What I did not understand was that on the one hand REST says that the
naming authority decides what the resource is that a given URI identifies
and that on the other hand people on this list said that the user of
a URI (the link maker) decides what resource it identifies.

Then I understood you to say that

- a URI (directly) identifies the one resource that the naming authority
  decides it to identify.

- a URI (may) **indirectly** identify other resources depending on the
  intention of the URI-user (the link-maker)


I haven't seen the idea of URIs indirectly identifying resources used in
the context of REST before, that's why I asked what you (or REST) mean by
it.


The practical problem I have is this:

The moment a user agent sends a request to the origin server, any 'indirection
information' is lost due to REST's unique addressing context. Certainly,
the origin server 'knows' what resource the URI (directly) identifies because
that is controlled by the naming authority. But all intermediaries have no way
of seeing/accessing any information about indirection in identification.

I read about the idea (thanks Mark!) that intermediaries can provide
information about the resources that the URIs identify they see in requests
'running through' them and weave that information into the representation
returned to the user agent. It was then that I understood the advantages of
a unique addressing context, because the intermediary knows that a given
URI unambiguously identifies a single resource.

Given the idea of 'indirect identification' the question arises, how
intermediaries can usefully enhance representations with information they
obtained, for example, from an RDF document.

I like the collaboration idea, which seems to come down to the possibility
that many *indirect* identifications can affect/alter a naming authority's
decision about the *direct* identification. Wonder how intermediaries can
contribute to this process.

It would be better to say that the link-maker is indirectly identifying
other resources (for which he is ignorant of a better URI, if any)
through use of a URI that seems to result in what he wants when it
is used.  Whether or not his intended resource is, in fact, the one
identified by the URI (by means of the owner maintaining the mapping)
is unknown to that link-maker.

It gets worse: over time, if the majority of link-makers have a 
different
opinion about the nature of the resource being identified than the 
owner,
they might change the owner's opinion as well.  [oh, you mention that

Hmm, well, from my point of view, the idea that "http" URIs are ever
used to directly identify anything is a bit absurd.  The interface is
there to hide the nature of what is behind it, and it cannot do that
very well if the clients have to know what it is.

&gt; The practical problem I have is this:
&gt;
&gt; The moment a user agent sends a request to the origin server, any

&gt; identification.

The server doesn't know either -- it relies on the human maintainer to 
know
well enough to set up the correct mechanism for the mapping.

&gt; I read about the idea (thanks Mark!) that intermediaries can provide
&gt; information about the resources that the URIs identify they see in 
&gt; requests
&gt; 'running through' them and weave that information into the

&gt;
&gt; Given the idea of 'indirect identification' the question arises, how
&gt; intermediaries can usefully enhance representations with information 
&gt; they
&gt; obtained, for example, from an RDF document.

They can only state what they know, and that very carefully.  Just like
real life, an intermediary must either state only what it has observed
in the past, or state its predictions on the future in terms that make
clear they are only guesses based on past observations.

&gt; I like the collaboration idea, which seems to come down to the 
&gt; possibility
&gt; that many *indirect* identifications can affect/alter a naming 
&gt; authority's
&gt; decision about the *direct* identification. Wonder how intermediaries 
&gt; can
&gt; contribute to this process.

That is one of the main weaknesses of HTTP -- there is no way for a
proxy to distinguish between authoritative responses and ones that
it cooked up on its own.

I'll be in England this week, so no more from me on this thread.

Hmm, this suggests (IMHO) that it is 'bad practice' to use URIs to
identify other resources than the ones they identify by definition their
naming authority.

Example:  Given a URI that identifies a resource that 'is a document' (the
abstraction of a document), say a paper about presidential democracy, it
would be bad practice to use that URI to identify the idea 'presidetion
democracy'.

I think this is what I don't get in my head. It is exactly what people do
all the time but this common practice seems to be very unRESTful.

Or am I just confused by RDF/SW abuses of the Web?

Taken to extreme: if thousands of RDF authors would use my email address to
identify 'me' in RDF documents, should I then call my ISP (the naming authority)
and have him change the definition of what resource my email address identifies?


However, thanks for all the answers to myquestions. You all have been
very helpful.

<pre>This is propably an old question:

Given two URIs 

http://www.example.org/foo#moo1
http://www.example.org/foo#moo2

do they identify the same resource or not?

Since the origin server will never see the fragments, it will apply the
same mapping (resource) when processing a request on either one of them.

Hold it.  You're calling an URI a resource above.  That's going to
cause confusion.  Are you saying that the first URI identifies two
resources, namely the one that it identifies directly, and also the one
that can be identified directly by the second URI?  First let me get
that part straight.

If that's your claim, then I'll now need to know more about what
the phrase "used to produce a representation of" really means.  Do
you  mean they share a representation?  Do you mean something
which occurs in the server implementation that cannot be observed
on the network?  Are you sure this is any form of identification at
all, let alone "indirect identification"?  I have no idea, as the phrase
"indirect identification" is new to me.

That doesn't really seem any different, except that you've introduced
content negotiation.  Are you implying that all content negotiation
scenarios involve the "indirect identification" phenomenon?


I'm concerned  about the quality of the terminology, especially the
term "indirect".  To me, it doesn't mean indeterminate; it just means
that the identification is multi-stage.  In
this setting, that implies identifier that points to identifier that
points...
until something other than a pointer results.

If the phenomenon is something other than that, I'll bet a better
terminology can be found.  Like "selection via association" maybe.

&gt;
Arrrggg.  I did not call a URI a resource.  I identified a resource by 
using its name.
I refuse to go around talking about resources as 'the resource 
identified by http://...'.  It's a resource and it has a name - when I 
talk about it, I'll use its name.  Do you refer to other people as 'the 
human identified by Fred', or do you just say Fred.

(Yes, I'm frustrated. I'm tired of having to argure the whole way back 
to first principles every time a statement is made.  Sometimes I think 
some wicked grammar school teacher has exacted her revenge by having 
taught me an alternate version of the English language - one that seems 
similar on the surface, but is different enough to cause me problems any 
time I try to convey ideas to someone else.  Either that, or I'm some 
kind of strange Italian who can't communicate without using a whiteboard.)

&gt;"indirect identification" is new to me.
&gt;

When a representation is produced (in order to satisfy a GET, for 
instance), the bits that comprise it are either dynamically calculated 
at the time the request is made, or retrieved from some other resource(s).
In the cases where those bits are retrieved from some other resource, I 
claim that those other resources are indirectly indentified.

Now perhaps I've twisted the definition of 'indirect', but I don't think 
so.

If I identify a group of people as 'White males', do I not also also 
indirectly indentify myself by virtue of belonging to that group.

&gt;: Or
&gt;: Directly identified resource:  http://example.com/pictures/picture1
&gt;: Indirectly identified resources: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.jpg,
&gt;:   file://docroot/story/images/picture1.png,

&gt;: where content negotation on the directly identified resource results in
&gt;: the use of the representation of one of the indirectly identified
&gt;: resources as the representation of the directly identified resource.
&gt;
&gt;That doesn't really seem any different, except that you've introduced
&gt;content negotiation.  Are you implying that all content negotiation
&gt;scenarios involve the "indirect identification" phenomenon?
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I didn't intend to imply that its true for ALL content negotiation 
(although it might very well be).  I just saw content negotiation for 
static content as a way to illustrate how directly identifiying one 
resource MIGHT result in the indirect identification of other resources.

&gt;I'm concerned  about the quality of the terminology, especially the
&gt;term "indirect".  To me, it doesn't mean indeterminate; it just means
&gt;that the identification is multi-stage.  In
&gt;this setting, that implies identifier that points to identifier that
&gt;points...
&gt;until something other than a pointer results.
&gt;
I don't understand why you think it means indeterminate.  It's no more 
indeterminate than the relationship between a resource and its 
representations over time.

&gt;
&gt;If the phenomenon is something other than that, I'll bet a better
&gt;terminology can be found.  Like "selection via association" maybe.
&gt;  
&gt;
I dont understand what "selection via association" means.

In my mind, indirect indentification is, in part, a result of resource 
composition - resources can be composed of other resources.

: &gt;: where a representation of the indirectly identified resource is used to
: &gt;: produce a representation of the directly identified resource.  This is
: &gt;: the case for what is commonly referred to as 'static content'.
: &gt;
: &gt;Hold it.  You're calling an URI a resource above.  That's going to
: &gt;cause confusion.  Are you saying that the first URI identifies two
: &gt;resources, namely the one that it identifies directly, and also the one
: &gt;that can be identified directly by the second URI?  First let me get
: &gt;that part straight.
: &gt;
: &gt;
: Arrrggg.  I did not call a URI a resource.  I identified a resource by
: using its name.
: I refuse to go around talking about resources as 'the resource
: identified by http://...'.  It's a resource and it has a name - when I
: talk about it, I'll use its name.  Do you refer to other people as 'the
: human identified by Fred', or do you just say Fred.

Chuck (does that answer your last question?), ordinarily I'd agree
with you, but you're talking about a system now in which a URI
identifies more than one resource, and that caused me a problem
in trying to understand what you wrote.  So sorry.

:
: (Yes, I'm frustrated. I'm tired of having to argure the whole way back
: to first principles every time a statement is made.  Sometimes I think

: similar on the surface, but is different enough to cause me problems any
: time I try to convey ideas to someone else.  Either that, or I'm some
: kind of strange Italian who can't communicate without using a whiteboard.)
:
: &gt;If that's your claim, then I'll now need to know more about what
: &gt;the phrase "used to produce a representation of" really means.  Do
: &gt;you  mean they share a representation?  Do you mean something
: &gt;which occurs in the server implementation that cannot be observed
: &gt;on the network?  Are you sure this is any form of identification at
: &gt;all, let alone "indirect identification"?  I have no idea, as the phrase
: &gt;"indirect identification" is new to me.
: &gt;
:
: When a representation is produced (in order to satisfy a GET, for
: instance), the bits that comprise it are either dynamically calculated
: at the time the request is made, or retrieved from some other resource(s).
: In the cases where those bits are retrieved from some other resource, I
: claim that those other resources are indirectly indentified.

I don't follow the language there, sorry.  You could always argue
that the representation produced is "retrieved from some other resource",
whether it was calculated dynamically or not.  I'm looking for significant
distinctions to understand "indirect identification" and not finding them.
That's my frustration with this thread.

:
: Now perhaps I've twisted the definition of 'indirect', but I don't think
: so.
:
: If I identify a group of people as 'White males', do I not also also
: indirectly indentify myself by virtue of belonging to that group.

You're definitely twisting the definition of "identify" here, because
identifying that group *does not* identify you, in the sense that it does
not make you *definitively recognizable* among the group.  It's not
that it's indirect (i.e., via some intermediate means), it's that it's in-
determinate:  "Hey, there's a group of white guys.  Which one is Chuck?"

That's interesting, because I think it's true that identifying a resource
is a means of indirectly identifying a *representation* (in the sense that
one and only one will be dished up per GET [identified], and the
representation is
not the thing you directly identified, but was available through an
intermediate mapping [indirect]).  It's also true that REST does not
guarantee
deterministic identification of a representation via its resource: if there
are two, you might get either one.

I was guessing; indirection does lay some of the groundwork for
possible indeterminism.  It's not like they're totally unrelated.

Well, I think Roy was explaining that sometimes hypetext authors
make reference to a resource that's not quite what they mean, but
it's associated with the intended meaning, and it's close in meaning,
and it's close at hand.  So they select it.  That would be selection
by association, wouldn't it?

:
: In my mind, indirect indentification is, in part, a result of resource
: composition - resources can be composed of other resources.

What an interesting statement!  What would that look like?  I
visualize it as the union of two or more resource mappings.  How
about you?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Anybody (Mark?) know anything more about this now?
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Oct/0060.html

"we present, variations of the World Wide Web's REpresentational 
State Transfer (REST) architectural style that are optimized for 
centralized, distributed, estimated, and decentralized systems.

"For centralized resources, we enforce simultaneous agreement by 
extending REST into an event-based architectural style by adding 
Asynchronous event notification and Routing through active proxies 
(ARREST). For distributed control of shared resources, we enforce 
ACID transactions by further extending REST with end-to-end Decision
functions that enable each component to serialize all updates 
(ARREST+D).

The alternative to simultaneous agreement is decentralization: 
permitting independent agents to make their own decisions. This 
requires accommodating four intrinsic sources of uncertainty that 
arise when communicating with remote agencies: loss, congestion, 
delay, and disagreement. Their corresponding constraints are Best-
effort data transfer, Efficient summarization of data to be sent, 
Approximate estimates of current values from data already received, 
and Self-centered trust management.

These so-called 'BASE' properties can be enforced by replacing 
references to shared resources with end-to-end Estimator functions. 
Such extensions to REST can increase precision of measurements of a 
single remote resource (ARREST+E); as well as increase accuracy by 
assessing the opinions of several different agencies (ARRESTED). The 
contributions of this work include: a formal definition of 
decentralization; an analysis of the limitations of consensus-based 
software architectural styles; derivation of new architectural styles 
that can enforce the required properties; and implementations that 
demonstrate the feasibility of those styles and sample applications."

I think he's primarily talking about the KnowNow extensions, though
I'm not exactly sure what KnowNow has done with full ACID or what an
"end-to-end Decision function" is.  I talked with Rohit about
ACID/KnowNow back in 2000 or so and at that time I think he and Adam had
"CID" worked out, with some thoughts about using underlying database
infrastructure to provide the "A".  It seems they've know got a way of
doing "A" in a decentralized manner.  I'm skeptical, but Rohit's
surprised me before.

Subject:Coordination, composition, and coupling:  Polyphonic C#<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Not immediately REST-related, but tangentially interesting...

---


Anybody looked at Polyphonic C#?

	http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/polyphony/intro.htm
	http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/polyphony/polyphonytoplas-PDF.pdf
	http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/polyphony/santa.pdf

Luca Cardelli and friends are plowing some fertile ground yet again.  
My initial reaction:  this (the idea of chords and declarative 
coordination / orchestration through method signatures) is perhaps the 
most significantly innovative thinking about the coordination problem 
since Gelernter's Linda.  (Granted, Polyphonic C# is a re-hash of some 
thoughts that have been showing up in theory-land (the join-calculus 
offshoot of Milner's pi-calculus) and in language-land (some offshoots 
of O'Caml) but this simplifies, unifies, and brings this to real-world 
programmers.

But I'm concerned about it.  While it does tackle the coordination / 
orchestration problem, it does so within the traditional framework of 
type-specific interfaces / OOP.  I'm worried that this might 
significantly increase coupling and impede composition.  It seems to 
move counter to the nuevo-retro feel of e.g. REST and the newish 
emphasis on generic interfaces, composibility, and "wide" values.)  In 
contrast, the pi-calculus lays groundwork for solving the coordination 
problem while keeping coupling dynamic (potentially run-time 
configurable) and while explicitly emphasizing composition.  Linda, in 
contrast, didn't have much to say about orchestration per se (states 
are implicitly captured in the history-driven use of the Linda 
sublanguage) but made decoupling in both time and space paramount.

I'm conflicted on this.  It sure does look new, neat, and useful.  But 
I'm worried that it takes a fundamentally broken model and hides the 
warts under a sexy new veneer --- tackling one rather smallish problem 
while actually exacerbating several other existing problems.

Extending this idea to the Web would seem to me to be pushing down that 
nasty SOAP-RPC road.

Maybe there's a way to capture this kind of declarative 
interface-driven orchestration in something like Mark's RDF-Forms.

Just musing out loud...

PS - mention of something called "Web combinators" in the refs in one 
of those.  Anybody here w/ first-hand info on this?  I can chase links, 
but a paragraph summary of the above would be useful.  My guess is that 
it's nasty type-specific adaptoid stuff, no?

Subject:300 response entity format<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Section 10.3.1 of RFC 2616 says the following about the 300
Multiple Choices status code:

"Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an
entity containing a list of resource characteristics and
location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one
most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type
given in the Content- Type header field. Depending upon the format
and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most
appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this
specification does not define any standard for such automatic
selection."

Are there any specifications or applications that do define such
behaviour? I have an application that needs to return a list of
redirection URIs. If there is an existing practice for doing this,
I'll follow that rather than define something new.

For the curious, an httpsy redirectory needs to be able to return
at least two redirection URLs: one for outside the NAT clients and
one for inside the NAT clients. See:

result, the client's behavior for the PUT version and the GET version is 
exactly the same.  Is this RESTful?  Half of me says "yes" because the

There's no guarantee, in general, that a PUT followed by a GET, even
"immediately", will return the same content.  The content crossed a
trust boundary; anything goes.  If you want an expectation of that sort,
it should be declared in the message (similar to SOAPAction).

It's possible there could be some self-descriptive problems with the
data format - I can't tell - but since this is a response and not a
request, that doesn't matter anyhow, I think.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] PUT question<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>There is not yet an architecture.  Actually, what brought this question 
up was the work going on with Atom [1], particularly with the API [2].  
When editing an Atom entry, the client will PUT an entry document of 
some form or another.  However, the set of elements that may be 
appropriate to edit do not necessarily match the set of elements that 
would be returned in a GET.  Examples:

1) There is a &lt;modified&gt; element that contains the modification 
timestamp.  It seems most appropriate for the server to set this value, 
not the client.
2) As is currently hinted at in the API, the server could generate the 
&lt;summary&gt; element from the &lt;content&gt; element.  However, it could be just 
as possible for the client to submit the &lt;summary&gt; itself.

Now, of these examples, only the first falls within my question.  The 
second example potentially relates to my question if the client does not 
provide the &lt;summary&gt;.

On the other hand, I suppose the whole thing could be avoided as 
follows:  require to the client to PUT the entire document, including 
the fields that do not change (e.g. created, issued, etc.) .  The server 
makes sure that the values in the new version are the same as in the 
current version, or else flags the new version as conflicting.  In this 
case, the server must rely on the client giving accurate update 
timestamps, an updated summary, etc.  In other words, the server only 
validates the data, but does not update it.  The disadvantage here is 
that the client must understand the entire document.  It would not be 
possible for a server to add functionality (via namespaced elements) 
that the client could safely ignore because, depending on the extension, 
the server may think there's a conflict.

*sigh* I dunno.  This approach doesn't quite feel right either.  Part of 
me feels that the actual use(s) of PUT is much more limited than a 
generic replace function, and part of me feels that the resource model 
is where the real problem is because I cannot use a simple PUT on it.

I think you can simply compare this behavior to the database world: if you
INSERT  a row into a table and do a subsequent SELECT there is nothing inherent
in the concepts of databases that assures that you get back what you inserted.

Only if you make sure that you wrap your interactions inside a single transaction
you can reliably make this assumption.

Within a RESTful system, you'd need a transaction-resource to handle this, though
I do not have this idea in my bones. Will give this some thoughts (help welcome).

Well, the simplest way would be returning an entity in the response.  I 
am beginning to think this is the part I have been overlooking with PUT, 
or at least not giving enough importance.  It's the response entity that 
matters, not the request entity.  I'm not yet sure how to put that in 
clearer terms.  I'll get back on this one...

I don't understand what you mean by this.

I understood that PUT was used to set the state of a resource, and that 
the desired state of the resource was expressed by the representation in 
the body of the PUT.

Why does crossing a trust boundary change that?

I should have been clearer, sorry.  By "anything goes" I just mean that
the content doesn't have to be bit-for-bit identical (though that seems
to be common practice), but it has to be consistent with the state
reflected in the request.

e.g. you may PUT "on" to a URI identifying a lightbulb, but a GET may
return a JPG of a lightbulb in the on state ... at least when you ignore
the possibility that the state changed between the PUT and the GET.

<pre>&gt; Just how useful does PUT end up being if the end result is "anything 
&gt; goes"?

A better way to think about it is that the request expresses the intent
of the client but the server is responsible for mapping that back into
the state of the resource (the client is not supposed to have a clue as
to how the resource is implemented, and usually doesn't even know what
defines it as a resource).  Most of the time it just ends up being the
same as a flat file store, but the flexibility is there when you need it
because it allows the server to evolve independent of the clients.

We don't need to require that the server do something sensible, since
whatever it does should be in the best interests of the resource.

This is also why the Web does not support write-back caching.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
(The following is a broad overview of a system I am developing; I think it
is right exactly up the alley of REST, though it proposes to transcend some
parts of the REST architectural setup, without violating its motivations. 
In two brief "appendices" I briefly begin describing the relationship
between this model and 1) RDF and 2) REST.  -- Seth Johnson)


Context Transfer Protocol

The context transfer protocol (CTP) is an end-to-end data transport protocol
that supports manipulable distributed hypermedia and data processing on the
basis of the concept of universal state transfer.  It employs a set of
abstract terms that designate the elements of a uniform structure for
representing and transferring state, called the uniform context framework
(UCF).

In place of documents and files, CTP implements contexts, manipulable
collections of resource elements which are referred to according to the UCF
abstractions.  All of the elements of a context are assigned key values
which function as links to the servers at which the elements originate. 
Because all elements are links, multiple contexts may freely reuse the same
elements.

The elements of the UCF reflect a universal information architecture which
supports all the fundamental operations one needs for managing information,
including modeling, updating and maintenance, manipulation, querying,
categorizing, distribution and dependency tracking.  In this way, CTP
implements the notion of an atomic application.  Fundamental information
processing functions for any application can be implemented simply by
declaring a CTP context, or by declaring multiple contexts to be combined in
a complex application.  Any CTP front end interface that surfaces the full
complement of CTP functionality can be used to browse and work with any
information for any other application served by a CTP server.

CTP is designed for scalability, providing a simple uniform interface
through the use of a small set of verbs (GET, PUT, REMOVE and HOST) and the
finite set of generic elements which make up the UCF.  CTP servers attain
the status of universal application servers in the sense that all
fundamental information management functions are provided by means of this
interface and the rest of the functions and architecture incorporated within
the protocol.

The information architecture underlying CTP affords a maximum degree of
flexibility in data processing.  Entity relationships for all applications
are stored in a flat fact table form, allowing information to be accessed
and worked with rapidly, flexibly and with implicit interoperability among
all applications.  In addition, by using the UCF abstractions as generic
primitives, CTP makes possible a highly granular procedural approach to data
processing that is unimpeded by the intricacies of entity-relationship
models or the strictures of table- or record-level distribution and/or
replication.  Higher-level techniques for managing complexity, such as
set-oriented and object-oriented data processing and programming, may be
implemented on top of the CTP layer.

Instead of working with information through the representation of diverse
entities in separate physical tables, the CTP physical data model is a
generalized and denormalized structure that directly represents relations as
such.  Relations implemented under CTP are called contexts.  CTP uses the
following generic abstractions to represent the elements of any context:

 * Space
 * Location
 * Standpoint
 * Use Type
 * Use
 * Link Type
 * Link
 * Use Attribute
 * Link Attribute
 * Use Attribute Value
 * Link Attribute Value
 * Use Category
 * Link Category
 * Use Category Value
 * Link Category Value

These elements make up the uniform context framework (UCF), a standard
structure for representing and transferring state.  CTP assigns unique key
values to each element, made up of a URL (designating the location of a CTP
server), a forward slash, and a key value unique to that server.  For
example: ctphome.org/18273645.

A general context in CTP is comprised of a use type related to a link type. 
A particular context instance is designated by a particular use of the use
type, which can have any number of links, particular instances of the link
type, related to it.  This combination of use types, link types, uses, and
links describes a traditional one-to-many relationship, wherein the various
uses of a use type serve as records of the parent entity type (on the
one side), and the multiple links of a link type serve as records of the
child entity type (on the many side).

In CTP, state is an aspect of contexts representing their generality, and is
designated in terms of the concepts of space, location, and standpoint. 
Declaring a state for a CTP context means that the context serves as a
convention among all clients and servers that participate in that state. 
Space represents the notion of an abstract realm within which numerous CTP
servers participate and interoperate as they support shared contexts. 
Location represents an individual CTP server.  Standpoint is an abstraction
used to represent states of narrow scope hosted at particular locations, for
the purpose of independent or provisional development work.

Generality of a state is designated by either providing key values for
space, location and/or standpoint, or leaving their key values empty.  A
state representing generality across an entire space is represented by
providing a unique key value for the space, while leaving the location and
standpoint keys empty.

A state for representing universal conventions would be designated by
leaving all three key values empty.  However, since this designates no
authoritative server for the state, contexts defined within such a state
cannot be managed by CTP, and would require ratification as standards by
external standards bodies, followed by general adoption in code and
practice.  With CTP, this process of fostering general adoption by means of
standards bodies becomes significantly less necessary.  Instead of
presupposing that state and physical data models are so arbitrarily complex
and diverse as to necessitate such a process in order to assure
interoperability, CTP provides for universal interoperability at the data
transport level.

Traditional entity-relationship modeling entails record- and table-level
replication in distributed environments because it binds sets of attributes
to individual physical tables representing discrete entities.  Under CTP,
distribution of attributes and their values is not accomplished in the same
manner.  CTP uses the UCF to distribute metadata describing the relational
organization of information across servers, while it leaves particular
attribute values at particular locations, where CTP servers act as their
authoritative hosts.  User agents and interoperating CTP servers may
maintain the currency of their local caches of attribute values according to
any algorithm appropriate to their own purposes.

Instead of binding sets of attributes to particular tables representing
particular entities, CTP uses the abstractions that make up the UCF to
describe scopes of relevance for link and use attributes.  Attributes can be
declared to be relevant for all links of a particular link type, or for all
links used by a particular use type, or for all instances of a particular
use or link regardless of general context (use type and/or link type), or
for any other of the finite number of scopes that can be described by the
possible permutations of the UCF elements.  CTP servers provide and maintain
appropriate attributes and values for various contexts according to these
scopes of relevance.

CTP contexts do not presuppose or require locking mechanisms, since whenever
user agents request an occasion to modify a context, CTP servers notify them
whether the context has been modified in whole or in part since the time of
the user agent's local copy.  CTP servers may implement shared contexts as
freely interruptible or as "reservable" according to diverse governing
principles.  Separate protocols may implement locking or other "reservation"
schemes on top of the CTP layer, for contexts for which that is desired.

Appendix A: CTP and RDF

The correlates for RDF's subjects, predicates, and objects under CTP are
uses, link types, and links.

CTP/Use - Rdf Subject
CTP/Link Type - Rdf Predicate
CTP/Link - Rdf Object

CTP moves beyond RDF's knowledge-modeling assertions by splitting subjects
into use types and uses, and then using the combination of use types with
link types to define atomic applications, contexts which automatically
provide all fundamental information functions needed to manage information
for any application.  Because CTP is designed in this manner, it is
perfectly suited for RDF applications.  It simply goes beyond the
knowledge-modeling purposes of RDF and the semantic web, to providing
universal fundamental functions and implicit interoperability among all
applications.

Appendix B: CTP and REST

Roy Fielding has articulated a comprehensive set of engineering principles
which constitute an architectural style called "representational state
transfer" (REST) intended to govern optimal Web architecture and Web
application design.  By describing how CTP's implementation of universal
state transfer compares with the architectural principles of REST, we can
address its design implications in an orderly and reasonably complete
manner.  The chief differences stem from the fact that past architectural
principles have presupposed the arbitrary complexity of state and data
models, and therefore have taken certain design decisions geared toward
managing complexity, which are unnecessary within CTP.

"Opera closely adheres to the standards issued by the [W3C]"

I wonder...

- if you have implemented this (because if you didn't, I think I will)
- since the remote host likely won't understand MONITOR, does your
  proxy pull the resource in certain time intervals?
- Most importantly: what is the format (DTD/schema/namespace/mime-type)
  that the reply-to container accepts? Propably some RDF-Form might help
  here ;-)  Or some additional 'Accept-Reply' header?

Anyhow...very nice!

Yes, a couple of years ago at Idokorro/Planetfred.  It was implemented
as an HTTP proxy, and was also usable as a surrogate (reverse proxy).

&gt; - since the remote host likely won't understand MONITOR, does your
&gt;   proxy pull the resource in certain time intervals?

It first asks the origin server if it supports MONITOR, and if so passes
it on.  If not, yes, it polls.

&gt;   that the reply-to container accepts? Propably some RDF-Form might help

IIRC, I think we extended Accept semantics (ick!) to apply to the
eventual POST request to the Reply-To URI, rather than the response to
the MONITOR request.  That's obviously a hack though.

&gt; Anyhow...very nice!

Thanks.  FWIW, MONITOR is going to be part of Waka;

  http://gbiv.com/protocols/waka/

and has also been discussed here several times.  Check the archives,
and also the Wiki, for example;

Subject:Implementing MONITOR<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi--

as promissed, I am right in the middle of implementing MONITOR
(using Apache/mod_perl) and, naturally, questions pop up immediately.

Here is my approach:

A server that has the MONITOR module loaded accepts requests of the form:

MONITOR /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Reply-To: http://www.some.org/my-feeds

The server will send notifications to the Reply-To URI everytime
the resource's state changes. mailto: URIs are allowed as values
for the Reply-To header.

The question I face is how to tell the server to stop sending
notifications...

- in the case of mailto:  URIs

  * I really want to avoid the receiver sending email replies to the server
    to continue the monitoring, as suggeted in

     http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HttpEvents

- in the case of http: URIs

  * what about returning a FORBIDDEN response code by the receiver?


Or would it be a solution to send a MONITOR again, this time providing
an additional header that will stop the 'subscription'?  That way it would
be possible to also specify time intervals during which notifications
are desired, e.g.:


MONITOR /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Reply-To: http://www.some.org/my-feeds
Notify-Stop: Sat, 27 Dec 2003 22:31:22 GMT

or

MONITOR /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Reply-To: http://www.some.org/my-feeds
Notify-Pause-Until: Sat, 27 Dec 2003 22:31:22 GMT

or 

MONITOR /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Reply-To: http://www.some.org/my-feeds
Notify-Schedule: &lt;more complex time information&gt;


Would this be RESTful?

I read quickly...

I don't like MONITOR as a "generic" method.

Monitoring is a stateful activity (can't think of a better
wording for that, unfortunately).  Ergo, Monitors are
resources proper.

That may be overkill in a lot of cases, but your question
seems to bring this out.

What are the arguments in favor of making MONITOR
a generic method, I wonder?  It seems that incremental
development is a counter-argument...

Subject:REST way of logging out?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hey!

Compliments of the season to everyone! :)

I'm new to the REST way of doing things and have a few questions to ask.

Let me first put down some of my assumptions of the RESTful way of doing things
because if these assumptions themselves are wrong then just correcting them
might provide me with the answers I need. :)

- Uri's must be nouns for it to make sense for us to be able to GET them without
having side effects.
- In the context of browsers, since we don't have wide spread access to PUT and
DELETE we use POST to accomplish them.


Now, the questions:

In a typical CMS application user are authenticated through sessions
(application-state) with something like this:

http://foo.com/user/login

which would present the Login form (a Representation) which the user would fill
up and POST to the same URI which would Login (an action that causes a
change-in-state) the user. The change in state of the "user" resource is
accomplished with a POST.

Similarly,

http://foo.com/page/edit/1
http://foo.com/page/delete/1

are representations of the "page with id 1" resource. Is this the right way to
look at this??

All changes in the state of that resource are accomplished with a &lt;FORM
action="POST"&gt; for example, saving after you have edited the contents of "page
with id 1" or committing a delete of "page with id 1".


In most web application the logout action is accomplished through a URI which
looks something like this:

http://foo.com/user/logout

This URI has the side effect of "logging out" the user and therefore it is
inconsistent with my assumptions of REST.

How can this be accomplished so that it makes sense in the current Web
Applications scenario where users are used to logging out using a URI as
opposed to a &lt;FORM action="POST"&gt;?

It seems that most of the so called webs scripting languages make it look like
POST is just a non-transparent way of changing the state of a resource as
opposed to the transparent GET. So developers tend to use the two
interchangeably!

Thanks! :)

(noun), and a DELETE on it would remove the subscription.  Also, each
event notification message included the URI of the monitor that produced
it.

<pre>Sandeep,

: Hey!
:
: Compliments of the season to everyone! :)

Yes, and two's complements of the season to you too!

:
: I'm new to the REST way of doing things and have a few questions to ask.

Uh oh!

:
: Let me first put down some of my assumptions of the RESTful way of doing
things
: because if these assumptions themselves are wrong then just correcting
them
: might provide me with the answers I need. :)
:
: - Uri's must be nouns for it to make sense for us to be able to GET them
without
: having side effects.

Or just to make sense...

: - In the context of browsers, since we don't have wide spread access to
PUT and
: DELETE we use POST to accomplish them.

When in Rome...

:
:
: Now, the questions:
:
: In a typical CMS application user are authenticated through sessions
: (application-state) with something like this:
:
: http://foo.com/user/login
:
: which would present the Login form (a Representation) which the user would
fill
: up and POST to the same URI which would Login (an action that causes a
: change-in-state) the user. The change in state of the "user" resource is
: accomplished with a POST.

Sessions are probably better thought of as conversational state, not
application state.  But when hard pressed, the distinction could be hard
to support.  Anybody got a pat answer for this?

:
: Similarly,
:
: http://foo.com/page/edit/1
: http://foo.com/page/delete/1
:
: are representations of the "page with id 1" resource. Is this the right
way to
: look at this??
:
: All changes in the state of that resource are accomplished with a &lt;FORM
: action="POST"&gt; for example, saving after you have edited the contents of
"page
: with id 1" or committing a delete of "page with id 1".
:
:
: In most web application the logout action is accomplished through a URI
which
: looks something like this:
:
: http://foo.com/user/logout
:
: This URI has the side effect of "logging out" the user and therefore it is
: inconsistent with my assumptions of REST.
:
: How can this be accomplished so that it makes sense in the current Web
: Applications scenario where users are used to logging out using a URI as
: opposed to a &lt;FORM action="POST"&gt;?
:
: It seems that most of the so called webs scripting languages make it look
like
: POST is just a non-transparent way of changing the state of a resource as

&gt; I don't like MONITOR as a "generic" method.
&gt; 
&gt; Monitoring is a stateful activity (can't think of a better

Yes... (see Mark's reply)

&gt; 
&gt; That may be overkill in a lot of cases, but your question

&gt; 
&gt; What are the arguments in favor of making MONITOR

The one that convinced my has been made by Mark: MONITOR uniform
because it is meaningful to all resources, so it makes sense to have it.
Besides: I learn only by doing and MONITOR is great for this ;-)

( http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Jan/0253.html )

It seems that incremental

In the risk of asking something I should actually now, what does 
"incremental development" mean in the REST context?

Thanks.

&gt; : - in the case of mailto:  URIs

&gt; :
&gt; : - in the case of http: URIs

&gt; :

I wonder what that means: "meaningful to all resources".  How would
you describe the state transition (or transfer) that occurs in response
to a MONITOR request?  Maybe I don't understand.

: In the risk of asking something I should actually now, what does

Nothing special for REST, just the idea of enhancing the
system in functional increments.  But as I think about it more,
maybe me concern is really in the area of backward compatibility
with already implemented resources.

I really need an aswer to my question above, or I don't know
what I'm talking about.

My pat answer: Application state is the
functionality you MUST provide no matter how
much control you have over client
functionality.  Session state is functionality
that really belongs on the client, but that
you can't put there fore logistical reasons.

<pre>ok, that was quick pat answer.
trying again:

Private resources are resources the state of
which all users are indifferent/ignorant except
one.  Shared resources are all non-private
resources.  You host private resources on a shared
server when the client isn't able to manipulate
the private resource itself.

Maybe I don't understand.

Hmm...all I want is to experiment and contribute some code that is
easy to deploy. So far I can see some very interesting consequences of
a MONITOR method, among them the possibility to turn servers into feeds
and direct them all to a single 'consumer'-resource that can do all kinds
of interesting combinations.

But isn't a simple 405 (501?) enough to tell a client that

Is not the following the real issue here:

The Reply-To URL would expect particular structures of representations 
of the monitored resource's state that the monitored resource will 
POST to it.  How do you make a MONITOR method that monitored resources 
would generically know how to handle, given this requirement?

Much of REST is geared towards addressing the diversity of state

. . . or you'd just say the monitored resource can send whatever 
representation it pleases (leaving aside content negotiation which 
might perhaps be part of the original MONITOR request).  But then why 
would it use POST to send the representation? (And how would it 
generically know what kind of POST structure is desired?)

With an additional header that allows content negotiation to take place
at the time of the MONITOR request. Propably "Notify-Accept" with the
same semantics as "Accept".

&gt; &gt; Depends on whether you're "thinking" or just "tinking".  This list is
&gt; &gt; an architecture discussion list, so I would say yes, it is necessary.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So I'll reiterate it:  What resource state does MONITOR act on?

&gt; with the same semantics as "Accept".


So the monitored resource would have to only POST existing 
standard "content types?"

Hmm...yes. what is the problem with this?  Or in other words: why
is this a problem in the case of MONITOR but not a problem for
the other methods?

Or am I misunderstanding your point?
