<pre>I've been reading this thread whilst writing up some blog posts on the
subject and was rereading the specs for "Content-Disposition", and it the
spec mentions:

disposition := "Content-Disposition" ":"
                    disposition-type
                    *(";" disposition-parm)

disposition-type := "inline"
                  / "attachment"
                  / extension-token
                  ; values are not case-sensitive

Looking at the extension-token specs elsewhere it would look like it'd be
acceptable for us rest-nazi's to adopt something like:

Content-Type: application/json
Content-Disposition: inline; concept=customer

(or even rel=customer if we wanted to keep some form of consistent naming
).  This at least covers declaring the disposition / concept we're
returning, and it looks like the SIP protocol proposed the
Accept-Disposition header [1] and from cursory reading around this looks
like this would be a valid (existing) method for defining these concept.s

Am I wrong?

&gt; Are there any specific quotes from the dissertation you are thinking
&gt; about?
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Expectations about resources (made due to discovered link semantics)
&gt; drive the construction of the request. They do not apply to the response
&gt; (aka 'self describing messages constraint').
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The purpose of self-descriptiveness is to enable intermediate
&gt; processing, so why do you insist application semantics in the message
&gt; body must be processable by intermediaries?
&gt;
&gt; In fact, the kind of semantics that should be self-descriptive in the
&gt; message body are general mechanisms like ESI (not application
&gt; semantics). Incidentally, a capability I'm looking work into HAL is
&gt; something equivalent to ESI - for that very reason.
&gt;
&gt; couple of relevant quotes from the dissertation:
&gt;
&gt; "REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be
&gt; self-descriptive"
&gt;
&gt; "Within REST, intermediary components can actively transform the
&gt; content of messages because the messages are self-descriptive and
&gt; their semantics are visible to intermediaries"

Well, you can still go with more generic types, such as 
application/rdf+xml, where "shared understanding" ((domain) knowledge) 
is described in linked ontology specifications. However, besides concept 
definitions, additional descriptions for specific actions are probably 
required, e.g., by extending existing property (relations) definitions 
with this kind of information (e.g. as it can be realized with HAL or ALPS).

or we define (in the linked ontology spec or somewhere else; ideally
globally)  what is the meaning of each of the fixed set of operations
(GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)  for each concept. This is not usually defined by a
media type, and is prone to different interpretations, thus leading
to incompatibilities.

This seems more and more like re-inventing the exact reason for having media types - but hiding/tunneling it inside some generic format like application/xml.

You are right in the way that, yes, it can be done. But there should be no need for it when the same thing can be done with a properly defined media type.

If you build your application on top of HTTP, using it only for transport of data and using only predefined domain-agnostic formats like application/xml, then, yes, you would have to put the domain specific semantics "somewhere else".

If, on the other hand, you accept HTTP as an application protocol, then you can use the media type for defining your semantics.

But, apparently there are different views of HTTP as an application protocol or a simple data transfer layer?

<pre>My intention would be to tell the customer that he's been sent a
"customer", in JSON format.

What is a "customer", well - that would agreed upon by whatever contact
your service has.  Whether "customer" is something that gets IANA
registered as having a specific set of attributes or locally "registered"
for your service/enterprise, such as you would ( or should ) register link
rel types.

I'd see this is a vague intermediary step - just as a client makes
assumptions based on a spec on what following a link rel of "edit" may
return, so two could the assumptions of parsing a "customer" object.

If need be - the header could specialized further with:

Content-Disposition: inline; concept=customer; version=1.2; schema=http://
.....customer12.xsd

&gt; 

Yes, correct. Or more exactly: HTTP methods mean the same thing regardless of context (uniform interface). Resource semantics (the stuff you learn about resources from hypermedia references) is what is defined in media types (or link relation specs).

Media types ideally do not specify what methods to use for resources with certain semantics. That would be an over-specification because it is up to the server to make these decisions (and change them anytime).

Media type specs however can fruitfully provide hints to the canonical/intended use cases that informed the design of the media type in the first place. SHOULD requirements often reflect that and inform server developers about the most sensible implementation choices.

What you can specifiy in media types is which method a user agent developer should use for the implementation of a control (e.g. GET on HTML &lt;a&gt; links or &lt;img&gt;es, POST/GET for &lt;form&gt;s, depending on action parameter, etc. But there is no guarantee (aka coupling) that the server will actually support that message. (It should of course, because it sent the previous hypermedia in the first place :-)

If a request fails, HTTP provides error codes to hint the client how to fix its own configuration to match a particular service's implementation. This is an aspect that is unlikely to change and likely needs only be adjusted once per live time of the service.
(BTW, this IMHO indicates a conceptual third 'xxx-time' between design-time and run-time. You might think of it as 'introspection time' or 'configuration time'. OPTIONS requests relate to this. Nice area for research, IMO).

&gt; This seems more and more like re-inventing the exact reason for having media types - but hiding/tunneling it inside some generic format like application/xml.
&gt; 

Yes, exactly.

&gt; You are right in the way that, yes, it can be done. But there should be no need for it when the same thing can be done with a properly defined media type.

Actually, strictly speaking there is no need for this in the media type either.

Yes.

&gt; 
&gt; But, apparently there are different views of HTTP as an application protocol or a simple data transfer layer?

In my experience, it is still very common that people try to bend REST in order to match their view of a problem - instead of bending their view of the problem to make sense from a REST POV. Such bent-versions ('views' in your sentence) of REST are not necessarily bad, but they are not REST as it has been defined[1]. This can sometimes make approaching REST more confusing as it already usually is.

&gt;

Speaking from experience,  POST/PUT/DELETE are (relatively) well defined
for document-style resources, which is absolutely to be expected.  AtomPub
fits the document/collection of documents design quite well. For anything
else, requiring slightly more sophisticated processing than just adding a
resource to a collection of resources, the semantic of the operations is
not defined by the HTTP RFC/media types, and in the best case is defined by
human readable means only ( API documentation).



&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But, apparently there are different views of HTTP as an application
&gt; protocol or a simple data transfer layer?
&gt;

I find REST an elegant architecture style, especially because of the
addressable resources and the uniform interface.

However, HTTP as an application protocol is biased towards document
management.  Of course one could bend one's point of view, invent domain
specific media type and adopt the uniform interface for the domain
operations. This, however, does not mean the semantic of the HTTP methods
is the same regardless of context.

For example a POST operation may start some calculations, generating a new
resource, or start a whole new virtual machine instance.    Does that mean
the semantic of starting a virtual machine is the same as the semantic of
adding a new PDF document to a collection of documents ?

Nina

P.S. my opinion may be of course biased.

&gt; I'd see this is a vague intermediary step - just as a client makes assumptions based on a spec on what following a link rel of "edit" may return, so two could the assumptions of parsing a "customer" object.
&gt;
&gt; If need be - the header could specialized further with:
&gt;
&gt; Content-Disposition: inline; concept=customer; version=1.2; schema=http://.....customer12.xsd

It looks suspiciously like you're trying to solve the same problem as:

   - The "profile" content-type parameter in JSON schema:

       https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03

       http://json-schema.org/

   - The "profile" link relationship (seemingly not IANA registered):

       http://microformats.org/wiki/profile-uris

       http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-profile

       http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values

Media type specialisation (via a "profile" parameter) allows
server-side content negotiation based on Accept.

I guess the "profile" and "alternate" link relationships require
clients to download multiple versions to perform client-side content
selection. But if the goal is less content negotiation than defining
which vocabulary is actually in use, the profile relationship works
fine and can provided out-of-band via the Link HTTP header.

Yes, but having to look for the "intention behind" is exactly the problem
of not-well-defined protocol for  the purposes of specific application.

&gt;  &gt; There has been lots of valuable feed back on this thread. Thanks a
&gt; lot to everybody who has contributed! Hopefully you now understand the
&gt; problem :-)
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The suggested solutions has been:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 1) Mint a new media type.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Apparently there are two different schools here. Some say, yes, go
&gt; for a new media type. Some say, no don't. And there is no agreement upon
&gt; which is best. See
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18183 for a
&gt; discussion of this.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 2) Use different URIs for the different vocabularies.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; This seems like an easy and well understood solution. As Mike puts
&gt; it: "in my experience, attempts to do "multiple things" while using the
&gt; same URI are not often successful" (meaning, "go for multiple URIs").
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 3) Switch on a media type parameter in the accept header (as for
&gt; instance "application/xhtml+xml;profile=xxx").
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; To me this seems like the most elegant solution - if it works. Some
&gt; people argue that the ";profile=xxx" parameter may get stripped by
&gt; intermediaries in the network. It has the advantages of minting a new
&gt; media type, but none of the drawbacks since it is still a well known
&gt; media type (if this is the right interpretation of the syntax!)
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 4) Switch on other headers like for instance the user-agent.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Not a generally used solution.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 5) Use all vocabularies in the same document.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; To me this seems too clumsy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of adding a new PDF document to a collection of documents ?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The semantic of POST is always 'process this' no more, no less.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is slightly different than what is defined by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it 'process this' is the intention behind that. (POST is HTTP's
&gt; &gt; &gt; catch-all method if no other is specific enough)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, but having to look for the "intention behind" is exactly the
&gt; problem
&gt; &gt; of not-well-defined protocol for  the purposes of specific application.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Nina, you have to understand that 'process this' *is* the purpose of the
&gt; specific application (from the application protocol POV).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What you are looking for is intent and that is manifested in the choice of
&gt; target resource in the first place.
&gt;

The target resource is part of the request - it's on the first line of the
message, after the method. Seems like you're being pedantic about
terminology here more than anything.

No, not in this particular case.

There's nothing inherently wrong about statements like "the semantics
of POST requests vary for different resources". The key is that those
varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived
only from the shared understanding between client and server. That's
not a violation of REST constraints or the HTTP spec, it's a small
clarification.

I definitely agree though, there are some REST constraints and
concepts that are misused. This seems to happen frequently with terms
like 'visibility' and 'self-descriptive' :)

Thank you.

The critical point is how the shared understanding between client and
server is achieved, and whether the "network-visible" semantic is
sufficient for the shared understanding.

In this thread it was argued the the semantic of REST operations
should be defined by media type.  I would argue this is impractical,
unless one has full control of the media types definitions one works
with.

Let's have a resource, which accepts "image/png" on POST and does
certain image processing, returning a resource URI, where the
generated image could be retrieved.  Where should the rich semantic of
the POST be defined, behind the network-level-visible "process this" ?
I guess it doesn't make sense to define it in the generic image/*
media type. Another option is the resource API documentation (most
probably not machine readable).  Yet another option is to define a
separate image media type, which is handled by this specific resource
only.  Any other options?
How does the client decides where to send the POST command, if it
wants a specific type of image processing? Out-of-band information
only?

Now replace the image with any domain-specific scientific data
representation (meaning one would not like to invent new media types
to represent complex data which already exists in multiple formats and
could be processed in multiple ways). Where do we define the semantic
of the "type of processing"?   Human readable documentation of what is
the processing resource intent?

&gt; I definitely agree though, there are some REST constraints and
&gt; concepts that are misused. This seems to happen frequently with terms
&gt; like 'visibility' and 'self-descriptive' :)
&gt;

IMHO any software architecture would benefit enormously, if defining
all critical points explicitly, rather than playing the game of
interpretation.

Nina

I would say the link-reltype that points to the page that accepts the POST.

The link-reltypes would be documented in the media-type spec.

It could go like this:

1) Client GETs image processing descriptor resource.

2) Server returns media-type "application/vnd.imageprocessor+xml". Now the client has a shared understanding with server about the server's capabilities.

3) The client selects a proper link from the response using link-reltypes documented in the media-type spec.

4) Client POSTs image to the selected URL.

All-in-all ... the shared understanding comes from the media-type.

I dare say, that is your opinion, of course. However, there's something
slightly bigger at stake here. IMHO, of course.

&gt; There's nothing inherently wrong about statements like "the semantics

The semantics of *what* about POST, exactly? This is where I see a subtle
rift in the space-time continuum that threatens to divide RESTafarians
everywhere. There's choices in resources as gateways into larger HATEOS
frameworks or as those subtler resources themselves, resources as APIs
themselves, and so on, all along the scale of correctness from bad to good;
the only semantics that REST cares about is "process this". Whatever you
place on top is your business, and exist in the ontology layer (with vocab
names / schemas / RDF(x) / whatever.

Again; it is *important* to point out that *REST* has no more semantics on
a resource than "process this". Get this wrong, and you start blaming REST
for problems that exists elsewhere.

&gt; The key is that those
&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived

You think it is small. Some of us think it is subtle - for sure - but
rather important. As soon as you think REST (or your favourite REST
implementation, like HTTP) carries semantics outside of the generic methods
and the generic response codes, you will blame it for all of your own
failings, and you might just miss out on the magic of REST in the process.

Again, all those semantics you talk about are supposed to be in the
content-type of the request and the content negotiation with given
resources. This is one area in which cool URIs are misleading.

&gt; I definitely agree though, there are some REST constraints and
&gt; concepts that are misused. This seems to happen frequently with terms
&gt; like 'visibility' and 'self-descriptive' :)

Well, I personally think that most people who understand REST, do not
understand REST, most probably myself included. It's a nice set of
constraints and methods that, when combined, gives awesome benefits, but
trying to explain the whole cake by pointing out its ingrediants will never
convince anyone.

The terms you point to are, in fact, quite often used more correct when
spoken, but not so much when heard, but that's just a side effect of having
poorly separated the REST fundamentals from the ontology and the
application specific noise. In terms of REST, visibility and portions being
self-descriptive is spot on - but in a strict REST sense, not the ontology
sense.

In other words, I can claim that POST on a given resource is
self-descriptive, as in "process this", but when other people hear me say
it, it comes across as "the ontology payload describes the resource and its
links", which is a different beast all-together.

Anyway, that was a long-winded way of agree with you on that sentiment. :)

Alex

What beyond "process this" are you referring to? Because I'm starting to
suspect you're talking about something more like API documentation?

&gt; How does the client decides where to send the POST command, if it
&gt; wants a specific type of image processing? Out-of-band information

Well, we're back to the moniker "this isn't a REST problem". Here's how I
do it, though; I've got certain resources as gateways into HATEOAS, and
further resources are documented as XHTML forms with links and RDFa as to
what to do with those resources and what to expect. There's a small
ontology of RDF which documents the API. That's it. It's small, RESTful,
and I can change it at will and with need - provided my clients are smart
enough to be RESTful first, and worry about semantics of resources second.

Kind regards,

REST is an architectural style, I guess you mean HTTP. If so, I agree
with you and that was basically my point. There are more semantics in
a given request than those that HTTP gives us. HTTP gives us
network-visible semantics, that is its purpose. The additional
semantics in a given request are not network-visible (but,
importantly, so what?).

&gt;&gt; The key is that those
&gt;&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived
&gt;&gt; only from the shared understanding between client and server. That's
&gt;&gt; not a violation of REST constraints or the HTTP spec, it's a small

&gt; Again, all those semantics you talk about are supposed to be in the
&gt; content-type of the request and the content negotiation with given
&gt; resources. This is one area in which cool URIs are misleading.

Unless you have a distinct media type identifier to cover every single
semantic in your application (or intent, etc.), then those semantics
will not be visible and can only be determined by the client and
server (via a contextual, shared understanding about the resource in
question) - whether that shared understanding is buried within the
semantics of a media type or a preceding link relation does not change
this.

The actually important consideration (which I have tried to bring up
several times now and had no response on) is whether or not this loss
in network visibility of intended semantics in the request is actually
a concern. The argument in favour of using new specific types seems to
imply that making the intent visible on the network is both possible
and desirable. I don't think either of those assumptions holds true:

1. network visibility is valuable because it facilitates intermediate
processing (stuff like caching, ESI, etc.)  all of these mechanisms
are generic and non-specific.
2. as I argued above; unless you have a specific media type for every
individual semantic, there is still ambiguity in the message and you
won't get more 'visibility' anyway.

Mike

No, sorry, you got this wrong. Check step (3) again: "The client selects a proper link from the response using link-reltypes.

So the variation is on the link-reltype NOT the media-type. That's very very different. There's a gazillion link-reltypes, but only a small-ish set of media-types.

The client will POST the image as standard media-type image/png (or image/[jpg|gif|tiff|...]) - not as "application/vnd.image_blur+xml".

The server will know what to do with the image by knowing what URL it was posted to.

Hi Jorn,

In this example the shared understanding is really coming from the link
relations. Link relations can exist independently from the media type,
which is how shared understanding is established when using generic
(hyper)media types.

<pre>&gt;The argument in favour of using new specific types seems to
&gt; imply that making the intent visible on the network is both possible
&gt; and desirable. I don't think either of those assumptions holds true

And this is also a critical question of this discussion.

Media-types like images benefit from network visibility - for instance when using the Opera Mini browser that depends on Operas servers to reduce the size of the images on the network.

But it is hard to argue that network visibility is desirable with examples of more problem domain specific media types (like for instance application/vnd.imageprocessing+xml) since we cannot come up with good use cases for that. But allow me to try anyway ...

Assume we have two companies working together on e-commerce, but due to historical reasons they use different domain specific media-types. If these types are visible on the network then we can (in theory) have transparent/invisible intermediates that transform back-and-forth when communicating with the other business. Just as we can transform images.

The same could of course be done on the clients instead of inside the network - but Opera Mini do not do that for good reasons.

Using network visible media-types opens up for use cases that we cannot imagine right now. Like the Opera Mini use case.

&gt; No, sorry, you got this wrong. Check step (3) again: "The client selects a
&gt; proper link from the response using link-reltypes.
&gt;
&gt; So the variation is on the link-reltype NOT the media-type. That's very
&gt; very different. There's a gazillion link-reltypes, but only a small-ish set
&gt; of media-types.
&gt;
&gt; The client will POST the image as standard media-type image/png (or
&gt; image/[jpg|gif|tiff|...]) - not as "application/vnd.image_blur+xml".
&gt;
&gt; The server will know what to do with the image by knowing what URL it was
&gt; posted to.
&gt;

Agree, my bad, it's link-reltypes.

Next step is to imagine there is somebody else' resource, also offering
similar type of processing.  A client would like to compare results , when
applying similar processing by both services (very typical use case, if
thinking of scientific data processing).

What would make the second service use the same shared understanding of
image processing media type / link-reltypes, if he is free to invent its
own?  This is what I call semantic - shared meaning of certain operations.
 Without this, all single REST resources live in their own silos,
regardless of how RESTful they are.

See, this is where you get it wrong. The semantics of the request are always the same. The is no shared understanding that the server needs to know about. The server only receives a 'process this' request and the target resource will process the request entity. The server does not need to care about anything else.

The client develops an expectation (from previous hypermedia) about the effect of the POST request, but that expectation is just that: an expectation. And it might fail anytime.

Talking about 'shared understanding' or 'varying semantics of POST requests' implies that there are application level semantics on top of HTTP. There are not, HTTP is all the contract there is.



&gt; The key is that those
&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived
&gt; only from the shared understanding between client and server. That's
&gt; not a violation of REST constraints or the HTTP spec, it's a small
&gt; clarification.

HTTP is not 'the network' (transport) it is an application protocol (transfer) and there are no application semantics layered on top. (Except when you treat HTTP as transfer, of course. As WS-* does)

What you are getting wrong, I think, is who knows about the particular applications being executed. You seem to think that server and client have a shared understanding about the application (e.g. buying a book at Amazon). They do not. Knowledge about the application in a RESTful system is only located on the client. The server has no idea what application a client is progressing through when it sends that POST. The POST means just this 'process this' and the given target resource will act on the POST as it sees fit.

The client then processes the response with expectations originating from the application the client is in. The server knows nor shares absolutely nothing about these expectations and has no obligation other than to 'process this'.

--

The hypermedia you learned from that /123 is an 'image processor' need not even come from the same server, you might have received it any number of ways. The server of that /123 resource will not expect that you learned anything about this resource. It will just invoke the mapping function (the resource) based on the current request.

There is no context and no shared understanding.

Regarding the media-type: REST states that media-types should be registered with a central authority (IANA, Enterprise, what ever). When registering new media-types the authority checks for duplicates - or sets up a procedure for avoiding them. This is REST's way of reducing the problem (I don't believe it goes away completely - but the problem becomes smaller).

Some link-reltypes are document together with the media type (as Mike points out, link-reltypes can exist outside any media-type - see http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml).

So when the client originally sent the Accept-header with application/vnd.imageprocessor+xml) it told the server to return a representation that contains link-reltypes documented in the media-type spec. Other link-reltypes are of course allowed, but may be ignored by the client.

So, again, the media-type becomes the turning point.

OK, then it takes a centralized global registry to allow / enforce a shared
semantic.  Which is not necessary REST related problem at all and is often
futile, when there is no incentive from the participating players.

Besides, I doubt registering new specific media types is universally
practiced by REST services developers. Otherwise, IANA registry would have
been sufficient, and no need for catalogues as
http://www.programmableweb.com/ or http://www.biocatalogue.org/ .

&gt;
&gt; What beyond "process this" are you referring to? Because I'm starting to
&gt; suspect you're talking about something more like API documentation?
&gt;

Machine readable API documentation as a start. With semantic capabilities ;)

e.g.  I am able to search and find web pages under certain criteria,
but not for web services, providing certain functionality.
There are registration sites for APIs, which roughly reminds me the
pre-search engines epoch of the WWW, or manually updating  'hosts'
files for managing IP address - domain name resolving.

&gt;&gt; How does the client decides where to send the POST command, if it
&gt;&gt; wants a specific type of image processing? Out-of-band information
&gt;&gt; only?
&gt;
&gt; Well, we're back to the moniker "this isn't a REST problem".

Well, it should be, otherwise a distributed architecture is largely
useless. Unless we are assuming any REST system is an isolated server
or server farm, running under single authority, and all potential
users and clients are aware of it and love to read its documentation.

Finding resources is critical part of any network architecture. If I
do not know nothing of Amazon, and there is no any search engine
available,  how I am supposed to find where to buy online books? Even
how I am supposed to know I _could_ buy books online?


&gt; Here's how I do
&gt; it, though; I've got certain resources as gateways into HATEOAS, and further
&gt; resources are documented as XHTML forms with links and RDFa as to what to do
&gt; with those resources and what to expect. There's a small ontology of RDF
&gt; which documents the API. That's it. It's small, RESTful, and I can change it
&gt; at will and with need - provided my clients are smart enough to be RESTful
&gt; first, and worry about semantics of resources second.
&gt;

Well, we do roughly the same, each resource describing itself with
RDF, according to a specific ontology. But I would not say this is the
mainstream approach.

Nina

Yep. Its not a perfect world. And it is a perfect example of what happens when you break the REST constraints: by not registering with a central authority (and sticking to it) we get too many overlapping media-types.

&gt; Besides, I doubt registering new specific media types is universally

Certainly not (and I am guilty as charged in this matter).

&gt; Otherwise, IANA registry would have

Well, to be a bit pedantic: these are not media-type catalogues, they are service catalouges, meaning they tell you where to find a specific service. Had it been a perfect world then all the "life science" services would communicate using the same set of media-types - but it would still be useful with catalogoues for discovery of the services.

It is more or less the same as the difference between a phone book and the network protocol used by the phones.

As I explained; the _network-visible semantics_ are always the same
from POST's definition in HTTP. HTTP will likely provide other types
of visible semantic such as conditionality, content-length, etc.

But - the intent/application semantics/whatever-word-you-want of POST
requests aren't the same between resources. For example; the meaning
of a POST to a resource that constructs hover-donkeys is not the same
as the meaning of a POST to a resource which submits condescending,
rhetoric-filled posts to a mailing list.

&gt; The is no shared understanding that the server needs to know about.

Of course there is - a server has to establish a specific
understanding of an incoming POST body to a resource in order to
process it in a specific way.

&gt; The server only receives a 'process this' request and the target resource will process the request entity. The server does not need to care about anything else.

What distinction are you drawing between the processing the 'server'
does and the processing the 'resource' does, and why? I find your
interpretation extremely confused, personally.

Yes, this should comprise part of a shared understanding.

&gt; Talking about 'shared understanding' or 'varying semantics of POST requests' implies that there are application level semantics on top of HTTP. There are not, HTTP is all the contract there is.
&gt;

If by 'application level' you mean 'Layer 7 in the OSI model', then
what are we required to use for this? There are already uses of
"application" beyond OSI; such as the one in 'hypermedia as the engine
of application state'.

&gt;&gt; The key is that those
&gt;&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived
&gt;&gt; only from the shared understanding between client and server. That's

Knowledge about the application in a RESTful system is only located on the client. The server has no idea what application a client is progressing through when it sends that POST. The POST means just this 'process this' and the given target resource will act on the POST as it sees fit.
&gt;

Is there another way to express this, I can't make head nor tail of
it. I think the confusion might relate to your distinction between
processing 'by the server' vs by 'the resource'?

&gt; The client then processes the response with expectations originating from the application the client is in. The server knows nor shares absolutely nothing about these expectations and has no obligation other than to 'process this'.

How can the clients expectation about what and how a given resource
will process a request (success or failure), and how that resource
actually processes the requests not involve shared understanding?

The server of that /123 resource will not expect that you learned anything about this resource. It will just invoke the mapping function (the resource) based on the current request.

Unless it was an entry point, a client needs some for of shared
understanding in order to know what it was meant to POST there?

When was the last time you implemented a POST handler of a resource and thought in any way about what the client expects?

Answer: "never"; because it is completely up to the resource what to do upon POST.

What you call 'shared understanding' is not shared (no obligation on the server) it is only an expectation the client has.

That expectation manifests itself by the particular choice of resource, yes - but the server knows nothing about that expectation nor does it care.

What I am trying to say: there is no contract layered on top of HTTP that ensures successful interaction. Instead, REST deliberately lets go of that kind of coupling because it cannot be achieved in networked systems.

REST only makes explicit that the server cannot be guaranteed to adhere to such a contract without introducing a level of coupling that makes it impossible for the server to evolve without telling all clients up-front.

Ahem, I think you're responding a bit fast. :)  My point was exactly this;
in REST, there are no semantics to specific requests any more than to
generic ones. Every POST is "process this" to the server, the payload is
interpreted and processed, but the POST is still the ambigous, context-free
(apart from the URI and content-type) request. All POSTs are the same to
REST, and that IS ITS SECRET WEAPON!

&gt; There are more semantics in
&gt; a given request than those that HTTP gives us. HTTP gives us
&gt; network-visible semantics, that is its purpose. The additional
&gt; semantics in a given request are not network-visible (but,
&gt; importantly, so what?).

Well, I think we agree on the statement that there's more to the POST than
what REST / HTTP gives us ... most of the time, however to make the point a
bit more concrete, here's an example ;

   POST /458745485 "46"

For some people here, this lack of specifics looks like a problem. To me,
it looked like a problem for a very long time, until, like Jan, I dived in
and embraced HATEOAS. It's *there* that semantics exists, not in the POST,
not in the request itself. The focus should be on the model, never on the
conversation, so to speak.

I find that until one grasps HATEOAS, you tend to treat things as clients
and servers. After a little while you realize that those roles flip back
and forth depending on your data, that client and server are less carved in
stone. Another thing is also that you stop treating this client / server
divide as a mostly one way communication, like with a more traditional API.

&gt; Unless you have a distinct media type identifier to cover every single
&gt; semantic in your application (or intent, etc.), then those semantics
&gt; will not be visible and can only be determined by the client and
&gt; server (via a contextual, shared understanding about the resource in
&gt; question) - whether that shared understanding is buried within the
&gt; semantics of a media type or a preceding link relation does not change
&gt; this.

If I request a generic resource and get back a map of FORMs with RDFa, what
more do I need?

&gt; The actually important consideration (which I have tried to bring up
&gt; several times now and had no response on) is whether or not this loss
&gt; in network visibility of intended semantics in the request is actually
&gt; a concern.

You have been answered, but I don't think you agree with them, so you keep
fighting the good fight, I assume. :)

&gt; The argument in favour of using new specific types seems to
&gt; imply that making the intent visible on the network is both possible
&gt; and desirable.

I think we all agree that no one solution is fit for all, and that one
should try to balance out the degree to which you split your semantics into
protocol vs. application. New content types makes sense if there isn't one
that adresses what you're doing. I mentioned earlier that the more specific
you can be, the less resources you will need to process them, but I won't
give you a clear binary answer here. Reach out with your feelings, Mike.

&gt; I don't think either of those assumptions holds true:
&gt;
&gt; 1. network visibility is valuable because it facilitates intermediate
&gt; processing (stuff like caching, ESI, etc.)  all of these mechanisms
&gt; are generic and non-specific.

Hmm, I think I've lost you there. How does the content-type mean any HTTP
request is treated as a special case (or, non-specific)?

&gt; 2. as I argued above; unless you have a specific media type for every
&gt; individual semantic, there is still ambiguity in the message and you
&gt; won't get more 'visibility' anyway.

Surely you don't think a black and white answer could possibly be correct?
The job of the good architect is to find the right balance between the
ambiguity of network transparancy and the specificy of application
semantics. Yes?

Yes, you have to work a little harder on the application semantics and the

Internet became massively useful after 1) distributed name resolution
called DNS was invented and 2) search engines became powerful enough.

I don't challenge the usefulness of catch-all POST on network level,
on the contrary.

What I do challenge is the missing semantic level, which makes
impossible to find out what all these resources are about. I don't
understand what's wrong of admitting HTTP is _the_ transport level for
myriad of specific applications, defining their own semantics in the
HTTP message body payload.  Or do we perceive OSI architecture fixed
in stone once and forever?  Sure it is in the textbooks, but not
always as positive example. It is often cited that early in the
Internet history, there were no precise idea what the applications
will appear, so why we insist there could be no layer above OSI 7?

Comparison with WWW is not fair.  There is a single shared semantic
for human readable web pages, and our brains (so far) are way better
resolving the semantics, compared to software code.

&gt;&gt; do not know nothing of Amazon, and there is no any search engine

&gt;

Well, having used Internet before  Altavista, Google, et al. became
into their force, I do remember times when web sites were
participating in "rings", where each site was happy to include links
to the next one in the ring, thus allowing a new sites to become
visible.  Another way to learn about a web site was for somebody to
share the link by email, or even offline.  The HATEOAS "follow your
nose" approach reminds me exactly this - no global knowledge, just
follow the next step. The power of Internet rose when the web of links
started to be analysed as a whole, not just looking at the next peek.

However, web services (not only REST) are in the pre-search era, quite
possible due to common semantics lacking.  May be because of something
else as well. IMHO only of course.

Scenarios - well, couple of, but details are not necessary in the
scope of this thread. Basically, having number of REST services under
common API running in several places in the world, how do you find if
there is a specific piece of information that could be retrieved from
any of them, or specific processing capability available?  Sure there
are custom solutions, but from this discussion I gather a generic one
is hardly of interest.

&gt;

Yes, that is the network perspective of the interaction (aka.
'visibility'). There are also server and client perspectives of the
interaction which *do* include these semantics - *established for a
URI by the server and shared with the client via some hypertext
control*. This has to happen otherwise neither would have a frame of
reference for how to make or receive the request. i.e. hypertext is
the mechanism by which shared understanding is exposed and controlled
in REST applications.

&gt;&gt; There are more semantics in
&gt;&gt; a given request than those that HTTP gives us. HTTP gives us
&gt;&gt; network-visible semantics, that is its purpose. The additional

&gt; in the request itself. The focus should be on the model, never on the
&gt; conversation, so to speak.

Again, you're addressing the separate issue of how semantics are
disseminated in hypertext applications. I absolutely agree with this,
hence:

"HAL is a media type with which applications are described and
controlled via link relations."
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html#general

The resulting interaction (e.g. the resulting POST request from
submitting a form) still carries the semantics of the hypertext
control that was followed, and that continuity produces a 'flow' which
we call an "application" (the other meaning of application, not OSI
layer 7). Failure is, of course, an important part of that continuity.

&gt;&gt; Unless you have a distinct media type identifier to cover every single
&gt;&gt; semantic in your application (or intent, etc.), then those semantics
&gt;&gt; will not be visible and can only be determined by the client and
&gt;&gt; server (via a contextual, shared understanding about the resource in
&gt;&gt; question) - whether that shared understanding is buried within the
&gt;&gt; semantics of a media type or a preceding link relation does not change
&gt;&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; If I request a generic resource and get back a map of FORMs with RDFa, what
&gt; more do I need?
&gt;

This should probably be in a separate thread, but I'll post it anyway.. :)

One of the major issues I have with the RDF model is that it's
objective seems to be to make every resource a possible 'starting
point' - i.e. it tries to provide a model for 'bootstrapping' a
machine client into a context for any 'generic' resource on the web.
We don't have this in REST, instead we have a limited set of entry
points and from then on discovery/traversal of an application at run
time. This means there's a tonne of features (read: bloat) and
assumptions that are inherent to implementations like RDFa which, from
a REST pov, are at best distracting and at worst actually corrosive to
the kinds of behaviours we are trying to invoke when designing RESTful
hypertext applications.

REST's perspective on semantics seems to be based on a relational
theory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory) whereas RDF's
perspective seems to be based on more of an absolute theory
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_theory). I believe this
difference  is at the root of the apparent schism between REST and RDF
and I can't find a way to reconcile this, so I avoid RDF.

I still wanted a generic media type but without the RDF baggage, so
that's why I created HAL. Some other people seem to prefer it too.

Mike

&lt;/snip&gt;

think about what you say here: that there is a "shared semantic"
understanding. and where does this understanding exist? only (and
solely) in the head of humans?

after careful review, i claim you will find that there *are*
real-world markers, indicators, semantic "switches" that exist in the
real world; ones that are recognized, parsed, and (when appropriate)
activated by humans. Currently, thesemarkers are the visual cues that
are rendered by common Web browsers via the messages sent by servers
in the most ubiquitous human-centered hypermedia format of the day;
HTML.

"Semantic meaning" is an emergent property. In the case of HTML that
property is "created" by humans when they observe the visual
"landscape" rendered by  Web browsers.

Does anyone here want to assert that this "semantic meaning" can
_only_ emerge when humans are *directly* involved in the real-time
interpretation of messages that contain these (or similar) markers? Or
is it possible that humans can "code" agents to have (at least some
of) this same ability to recognize, parse, and activate the
"affordances" found in the hypermedia landscape?

It is my assertion that the latter is the case. I also contend that
making the assumption that this is possible is a key step in advancing
the art and theory of distributed hypermedia.

Afaict, there's a spectrum of sophistication here. I haven't seen a
client implementation which demonstrates automated capabilities which
come 'close' to that of a human, we're basically talking about the
web's version of a Turing Test.

Most of the evidence so far suggests this is the case, although I am
not an AI expert.

&gt; Or
&gt; is it possible that humans can "code" agents to have (at least some

&gt;

I think it's an interesting research topic but the complexity of
producing these sorts of clients is so high, it's inevitable that only
a small portion of your client base will behave this way (unless you
control them all, in which case your system is not very distributed!).
So, in practice, you will be forced to only evolve your application in
a way that caters to the lowest common denominator - undermining the
effort that has gone into more sophisticated clients. This is a big
challenge to overcome in and of itself, irrespective of the challenge
of inventing the designs for such an autonomous hypermedia agent.

Mike

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course there is - a server has to establish a specific
&gt;&gt; understanding of an incoming POST body to a resource in order to
&gt;&gt; process it in a specific way.
&gt;
&gt; When was the last time you implemented a POST handler of a resource and thought in any way about what the client expects?
&gt;
&gt; Answer: "never"; because it is completely up to the resource what to do upon POST.

- What the resource does upon POST is determined by understanding the
semantics of the application it is part of (e.g. processing
form-encoded credit card details).

- What the client POSTs is determined by its understanding of the
semantics of the application it is navigating through (e.g. submitting
form-encoded credit card details via a payment form).

This is a shared understanding, controlled by hypermedia, from two
different perspectives - server vs client.

<pre>HAL is 'lean' because it tackles only a small set of capabilities.
It's controls are essentially limited to outbound links and embedded
content.

There are no forms in HAL and this was a deliberate design decision
based on the assertion that such mechanisms rely on a level of
sophistication that is just not realistic at the moment. Basically,
adding forms wouldn't achieve much and would increase the costs of
adopting it as a format. I am working on a separate design which
extends HAL to add in templated writes or 'forms', but this will be a
separate type and not a new version of HAL.

No, this is where you get it wrong. The resource has no idea what the
application is. Especially is it not bound to whatever the client expects.
Â 
Hypermedia received by the client tells clients something about the nature of
certain resources (e.g. an HTML &lt;img&gt; element, an AtomPub &lt;collection&gt; element,
an OpenSearch &lt;Query&gt; element or a hypothetical order-processor semantic defined
in some procurement media type).
Â 
An yes, the client chooses to interact with certain resources based on what was
learned from such hypermedia. But beyond that, there is no obligation for the
server, no shared contract, no shared nothing.
Â 
Especially can the client not rely on:
Â 
- the methods supported by the server for that resource
Â 
- the response the server will return for invoking that resource
Â 
- the implementation details or particular state changes that will occur on the
server side.
Â 
E.g. If you POST to an AtomPub collection, the server might well respond with a
202 instead of a 201, no matter what the AtomPub spec chose to say
would/should/might happen.
Â 
E.g. If you PUT to an AtomPub 'edit-URI' the server might well inform you that
PUT is not supported, advising you to use POST instead.
Â 
You are (in my perception of your replies - which might be wrong of course)
trying to fit an RPC mental model onto REST because you are insisting on
*shared* understanding and that the server 'knows the application' (which it
does in RPC style architectures)

Â 
And this is at the heart of REST's evolvability, because it is the very reason
why e.g. Amazon does not (in no way) need to ask every of its zillions of
customers before making a change to their servers.
Â 
And this is not only true for Browser-based interactions, it is equally well
true for so called machine to machine interactions. (There is just a varying
degree of how often a human actor is given an action step in the execution of
her own use cases).

One could argue there are at least two levels:
1) Technically, a common meaning of HTML tags, interpreted uniformly
(well, almost) across browsers
2) A shared meaning conveyed by the language and visual symbols and
eventually emerging, yes, in human heads.  Eventually, because it
depends on the context, culture, etc.

There is an analogy with 1) uniform POST semantics at the network
level and 2) application meaning from the pov of application.

Not necessarily an emergent property only. The meaning can be formally

representation, etc) and encoded in the software. The encoded semantic
essentially constitutes  the shared understanding between the client
and the server.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone here want to assert that this "semantic meaning" can

Anybody can create a client, which will read the same HTML tags on a
web page, but it will hardly be expected these days to have full human
reasoning capabilities.

i suspect i've dragged this thread way off course. Mike Kelly and i
have had a similar convo many times over the last year or so and i was
really just "poking the bear" w/ my post; my bad&lt;g&gt;.

suffice to say that, for the most part, i concur w/ your observations.

the power and flexibility of machines does not match that of humans;
that is not needed in order to "code" hypermedia agents to accomplish
[selected|limited|simple|etc] tasks on behalf of humans.this is
already happening today and will continue to grow overtime. most of
the work is being down "outside" the "hypermedia space" right now, but
i am finding some very interesting research that leads me to think
apply hypermedia is not out of the question. [1]

whether "meaning" exists within a message or is derived from the
message by some means ("interpretation", etc.) is well beyond the
scope of this list. my current thoughts are influenced greatly by the
work of James Gibson[2] and and Donald Norman[3]. i'll leave off this
part of the convo as i have little tangle proof for my POV at this
time.

sorry for the detour.

&gt;&gt;&gt; effort that has gone into more sophisticated clients. This is a big
&gt;&gt;&gt; challenge to overcome in and of itself, irrespective of the challenge
&gt;&gt;&gt; of inventing the designs for such an autonomous hypermedia agent.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Agree.

I assume you mean they can do stuff like 'safely' altering their
checkout flow? Fwiw, making sweeping changes like this to web apps is
generally a risky business - ask any e-commerce company's customer
services department for confirmation.

This ability to evolve the application flow of web apps is due almost
entirely to the sophistication of the human brain. Machine agents do
not behave this way. If you have evidence showing they can, please
share it.

&gt;
&gt; And this is not only true for Browser-based interactions, it is equally well
&gt; true for so called machine to machine interactions. (There is just a varying
&gt; degree of how often a human actor is given an action step in the execution
&gt; of her own use cases).
&gt;

No it's not, it's a completely different kettle of fish.

Not sure where you take this 'evolve the application flow of web apps' from. For
one, there are lots of changes that do not involve changing the order in which
interactions occur (which I assume you mean by flow) and secondly, I did not
mean to say that such changes would magically be enabled by REST.
Â 
The thing is however, that REST enables communication to *happen* even if the
intended application fails to run into a success state in the end. REST clients
(i.e. HTTP clients) will be able to handle all possible kinds of error states
(by virtue of implementing HTTP completely) and we will generally be able to
proceed(!) from failure states at a much more sophisticated level than with a
broken RPC application. The latter just dies with some convoluted exception in
some log in some obscure location.
Â 
For me, leveraging the power of HTTP as-is is at the heart of applying REST
successfully - we need not seek for building AI into clients - that's an
illusion anyhow.

Ok, this is all fine - I'm not sure that anyone was suggesting this is not
the case. We got to this point because we were discussing whether or not a
server should 'know' about the part of an application it is responsible for
dealing with. I'm still not convinced that a server can 'know nothing'
about a given resource's role but, at the same time, be able to process
requests to it in a specific way.

To be honest, this conversation isn't really going anywhere and hasn't been
for some time. I still feel there are unanswered questions from much
further back in the thread that are worth exploring, maybe we should head
back to them or just drop this entirely?

<pre>Mike, you argue quite a lot in favour of only using link-reltypes. For 
instance in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18337:

&gt; There are also server and client perspectives of the
&gt; interaction which *do* include these semantics - *established for a
&gt; URI by the server and shared with the client via some hypertext
&gt; control*. This has to happen otherwise neither would have a frame of
&gt; reference for how to make or receive the request. i.e. hypertext is
&gt; the mechanism by which shared understanding is exposed and controlled
&gt; in REST applications.

And in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18322:

&gt; In this example the shared understanding is really coming from the link 
&gt; relations.
&gt; Link relations can exist independently from the media type, which is how
&gt; shared understanding is established when using generic (hyper)media types.

So, in short, "hypertext is the mechanism by which shared understanding is 
exposed and controlled in REST applications.".

If you follow this logic then you could even argue that media-types in 
headers are completely irrelevant. All you need to do is to decorate the 
link-reltypes with the possible media-type. Instead of one link with reltype 
"salesorder" you could have "salesorder-xml", "salesorder-pdf", 
"salesorder-IBM", and so on - and throw away content negotiation at the same 
time.

But it builds on a false assumption of always following a link-reltype. Here 
is a couple of examples where it won't work:

- A friend sends you a link to an image. You click on it and have absolutely 
no link-reltype to indicate what kind of stuff you will get. "Luckily" the 
server returns content-type: image/jpeg such that your browser knows how to 
handle it.

- A spidering service is presented with a bunch of URLs it should index. It 
has no apriori knowledge of what to get from those URLs. Again the server 
returns a usefull content-type and magic happens (and application/xml is not 
usefull from this prspective).

- The &lt;img src="..."/&gt; has no link-reltype stating "this is a JPEG" or "this 
is a GIF". It relies on the returned content-type (and content negotiation 
with the accept header).

- A paper bussiness card contains a URL to the digital representation of it. 
What if the server returns "application/xml"? How would you know how to 
decode it? Luckily it returns "application/vcard+xml" (or "text/vcard" or 
...).

- A price comparing services trawls through whatever URLs it can pick up 
from the internet, looking for media-types "application/vnd.sap.pricing+xml" 
(fictive) and "application/open-pricing+xml" (also fictive). When ever it 
finds those it will read prices and accumulate a database of them.

My last example is what I think is most important. Here is what would happen 
if we only use application/xml and link-reltypes:

a) The client retrieves a hypertext document from server A.

b) The hypertext document contains a link with reltype 
"this-is-an-imageprocessor-of-type-X" that links to server B which is not 
under the control of server A.

c) The client follows the link sending an accept header with "Accept: 
application/xml".

d) The server returns "Content-type: application/xml" and, well, some XML.

e) Unfortunately server B has been upgraded without informing server A (how 
should it, it is a truely distributed system with independent components). 
So it instead of returning XML for "imageprocessor-of-type-X" (as the 
link-reltype told the client) it now returns XML for 
"imageprocessor-of-type-Y".

f) The client breaks.

If instead the client had sent "Accept: application/imageprocesser-x+xml" 
then the server would have known that it should return the old format - or a 
redirect to a server capable of working with the expected format.

By utilizing not only link-reltypes but also media-types we make it possible 
to work in a truely distributed network system where the servers as well as 
clients are free to change over time without any kind of coordination.

The link-reltype tells the client what link to follow - the media-type in 
the accept header tells the server what the client expects from it - 
something that the server cannot know otherwise.

The fact is that link-reltypes are not enough. Thinking so does not take the 
nature of truely distributed applications into account. It builds on the 
assumption that the resource that contains the link is coupled/synchronized 
with the resource that it points to. I think Jan has been trying to say this 
a couple of times - here is my interpretation of it.

We need something more than link-reltypes and media-types is the answer to 
that.

Sorry, don't buy it. 1) DNS was important for sure, but not crucial to the
initial success, and 2) search engines became poweful *because* of REST,
not despite it.

&gt; &gt; The ambiguity of REST/HTTP is exactly why it *is* so powerful as a
concept.
&gt;
&gt; AFAIK , REST is not defined as HTTP specific, on the contrary.

Uh, no, it's the other way around; HTTP is defined as REST. I often say
REST/HTTP because we mostly blur the lines between the two in most of these
discussions, but yes, HTTP is an implementation of a RESTful protocol.

&gt; What I do challenge is the missing semantic level, which makes
&gt; impossible to find out what all these resources are about.

Impossible?

&gt; I don't
&gt; understand what's wrong of admitting HTTP is _the_ transport level for
&gt; myriad of specific applications, defining their own semantics in the
&gt; HTTP message body payload.

Is anyone denying this? *puzzled*

&gt;  Or do we perceive OSI architecture fixed
&gt; in stone once and forever?  Sure it is in the textbooks, but not
&gt; always as positive example. It is often cited that early in the
&gt; Internet history, there were no precise idea what the applications
&gt; will appear, so why we insist there could be no layer above OSI 7?

No one is denying that there is a layer above. It's just not REST, it's
something else. Currently, it's a mess, but with some good clues and a
growing best-practice, and early manifestations of specs.

What puzzles me is the insistence that this semantic layer belongs in REST.

&gt; Comparison with WWW is not fair.  There is a single shared semantic
&gt; for human readable web pages, and our brains (so far) are way better
&gt; resolving the semantics, compared to software code.

As much as I'd like to agree with you, I don't. There's plenty of known and
heavvily used content types that are not meant for human digestion, such as
images, CSS and JS files, JSON, and XML and further up into abstraction.
Only the *browser* is human readable; the markup, images and code is not
(unless you're a geek).

&gt; I do remember times when web sites were
&gt; participating in "rings", where each site was happy to include links
&gt; to the next one in the ring, thus allowing a new sites to become
&gt; visible.

It was also a very early example of social engineering.

&gt; Another way to learn about a web site was for somebody to
&gt; share the link by email, or even offline.  The HATEOAS "follow your
&gt; nose" approach reminds me exactly this - no global knowledge, just
&gt; follow the next step.

There's a difference between a trail laid down in bread-crumbs, and one
that is carved in stone. "Follow-your-nose" is not the same as abandon
common knowledge. Ever written a FOAF crawler? The principle is to follow
your nose, but using an established ontology. Whether you're traversing
nodes or resources (some times orthagonal to each other) doesn't matter to
the HATEOAS concept.

&gt; The power of Internet rose when the web of links
&gt; started to be analysed as a whole, not just looking at the next peek.

Not sure if I can agree with this, either. Even the web crawlers are
looking for the next peek, so I don't see a sharp edge between the past and
present here.

&gt; However, web services (not only REST) are in the pre-search era, quite
&gt; possible due to common semantics lacking.  May be because of something
&gt; else as well. IMHO only of course.

Big vendors and lock-in, I think. RESTful thinking has been around for a
long time, even in the pre-search era, but just like with good wine ...

&gt; Scenarios - well, couple of, but details are not necessary in the
&gt; scope of this thread. Basically, having number of REST services under
&gt; common API running in several places in the world, how do you find if
&gt; there is a specific piece of information that could be retrieved from
&gt; any of them, or specific processing capability available?  Sure there
&gt; are custom solutions, but from this discussion I gather a generic one
&gt; is hardly of interest.

Well, again, it depends on what you're after. This sounds more like a
problem of persistent global identiy management more than semantics of a
specific service, but it's hard to tell without a bit more info. Feel free
to raise another thread; it's RESTful, after all.

Alex

Yes, but you are the one who has decided well in advance that there is some
specific semantics required for this, something that is missing from REST
itself and the generic interface. Maybe you could provide a more concrete
example?

&gt; One of the major issues I have with the RDF model is that it's
&gt; objective seems to be to make every resource a possible 'starting
&gt; point' - i.e. it tries to provide a model for 'bootstrapping' a
&gt; machine client into a context for any 'generic' resource on the web.

Oh, don't get me wrong; I hate RDF myself, a bunch of sissy triplets
(triplets! Hah!) and anonymous nodes trying to act all-encompassing and
shareable, but with deep fundamental problems (persistent identifiers, and
the aboutness of resources) ... :)

However. RDF's heart is in the right place; ontology. And it is through a
separate ontology you get your semantics.

&gt; We don't have this in REST, instead we have a limited set of entry
&gt; points and from then on discovery/traversal of an application at run
&gt; time. This means there's a tonne of features (read: bloat) and
&gt; assumptions that are inherent to implementations like RDFa which, from
&gt; a REST pov, are at best distracting and at worst actually corrosive to
&gt; the kinds of behaviours we are trying to invoke when designing RESTful
&gt; hypertext applications.

Hmm, big words. Sure, the HTTP payload can be vexing, but far from hard to
solve (caching, being a big one) using a multitude of ways; cached maps,
cached resource mapping, cached vocabulary mappings, cached result-sets (of
generics), and so on.

I tend to say; create a crap HTTP client, and you'll get a crap HTTP
system. There is no need to create a crap HTTP client.

&gt; REST's perspective on semantics seems to be based on a relational
&gt; theory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory) whereas RDF's
&gt; perspective seems to be based on more of an absolute theory
&gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_theory). I believe this
&gt; difference  is at the root of the apparent schism between REST and RDF
&gt; and I can't find a way to reconcile this, so I avoid RDF.

It now depends on what you mean by RDF; the model (triplets, namespaces,
etc.), the RDF ontology, the RDFS, OWL (any of the three levels), or some
model that uses the RDF family model to create something else (possibly
meta). I can map RDF to Topic Maps just dandy, and create full-blown frames
theory graphs (named or otherwise) with cumulative histographical node
hopping just fine, so for me there is no limitation that RDF itself is a
faulty model. (And, truth be told, I don't use an RDF inferencer, I use
Topic Maps all the way down, including plural persistent identification
management and separation of concerns between ontology, meta-data and data)
I don't shun RDF (or, more specifically, RDFa) as it's a well-known, often
used (well, more these days) method of creating key-value pairs attached to
an ontology, and so just map those to whatever you need it for. I seriously
fear that bringing these kinds of semantics anywhere near REST will be the
end of all that is good on the web.

&gt; I still wanted a generic media type but without the RDF baggage, so
&gt; that's why I created HAL. Some other people seem to prefer it too.

Tooling, mostly.

I don't think I did, I've just been trying to make the point that you

do carry different semantics (determined by a hypertext application).
Not from a network perspective (i.e. visibility), but from the client
and server persepctive.

There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't undermine HTTP or REST.
Hypertext is definitely a concern of REST, which is why 'hypertext as
the engine of application state' appears in its definition. I'm pretty
sure Roy has stated a couple of times that hypertext should've been
fleshed out in his dissertation but never made it because of time
constraints i.e. not because it 'hypertext is a layer above REST'.

&gt;

Don't really mind what we call it; as long as it is capable of
presenting a succinct, coherent, human-readable description of the
various ways a hypertext application can be traversed.

not very fond 'ontology' though because the word stinks a bit of
esotericism, and I prefer to think and talk about hypertext
applications in terms of happening rather than being anyway.

&gt;&gt; We don't have this in REST, instead we have a limited set of entry

&gt; There is no need to create a crap HTTP client.
&gt;

The problem I have with this advice is that in a distributed context
(e.g. a big SaaS API) the clients will be not be written by me,
they'll be written by other people with their own (crappy) opinions
and (crappy) technology stacks.

The real art of designing a REST application is in coaxing/herding the
clients you don't control into adopting behaviours which will afford
you the flexibility to evolve. In many cases this means an application
design that compromises on 'perfection' in order to lower the barrier
to all the stupid clients e.g. this is exactly the reason there are no
'forms' in HAL.

Are these read/write applications or just read?

Do you have many external clients to your application? Did any of them
have no experience with RDF before interacting with your application?
If so how did the 'on-boarding' process go for them wrt RDF?

Hmm, I can see that I haven't been clear enough, but I'm not sure it's that
important. For me, POST doesn't carry any semantics but the generic
"process this" on the server side, not as an API nor as a stand-alone
resource. All its semantics are pre-determined by the client, the package
gets wrapped up snug, kissed for good luck, and sent to a resource hoping
it understands what the server is going to do with it.

The reason I bang on a bit about this is that there is a slight reversal of
responsibility as to the outcome of the request. In a traditional RPC or
SOAP those responsibilities lies with the client knowing upfront the ins
and outs of the API. HATEOAS changes the responsibility around, and forces
(in lack of a better word) the clients to not couple, to not make those
resource static. In a roundabout way it makes the client think in more
generic terms about the request, and that's a (IMHO) good thing.

&gt; Hypertext is definitely a concern of REST, which is why 'hypertext as
&gt; the engine of application state' appears in its definition. I'm pretty
&gt; sure Roy has stated a couple of times that hypertext should've been
&gt; fleshed out in his dissertation but never made it because of time
&gt; constraints i.e. not because it 'hypertext is a layer above REST'.

Yes, any package that defines a URI to other things are hypertext, of which
HTML is the most used one. There are some good formats out there which does
this (or reuse the URI definitions from XML Schema), including RDF and XTF
(Topic Maps).

&gt; &gt; However. RDF's heart is in the right place; ontology. And it is through
a
&gt; &gt; separate ontology you get your semantics.
&gt;
&gt; Don't really mind what we call it; as long as it is capable of
&gt; presenting a succinct, coherent, human-readable description of the
&gt; various ways a hypertext application can be traversed.

Why the human-readable part? View sourceness?

&gt; not very fond 'ontology' though because the word stinks a bit of
&gt; esotericism, and I prefer to think and talk about hypertext
&gt; applications in terms of happening rather than being anyway.

It has a defined use in information technology, so get used to it. :)

&gt; &gt; I tend to say; create a crap HTTP client, and you'll get a crap HTTP
system.
&gt; &gt; There is no need to create a crap HTTP client.
&gt;
&gt; The problem I have with this advice is that in a distributed context
&gt; (e.g. a big SaaS API) the clients will be not be written by me,
&gt; they'll be written by other people with their own (crappy) opinions
&gt; and (crappy) technology stacks.

For sure. On the other side, you can create beautiful stuff with SOAP, and
have a really good API as RPC. In other words, I'm not sure that "other
people" is a measure of correctness. Most people don't get HTML right.
Crikey, most people don't get English right! :)

&gt; The real art of designing a REST application is in coaxing/herding the
&gt; clients you don't control into adopting behaviours which will afford
&gt; you the flexibility to evolve. In many cases this means an application
&gt; design that compromises on 'perfection' in order to lower the barrier
&gt; to all the stupid clients e.g. this is exactly the reason there are no
&gt; 'forms' in HAL.

What's wrong with forms? I have a system which uses XHTML responses with
embedded forms and RDFa, and it's a self-documenting, self-describing,
browsable, searchable system to be used by humans (browsers) and computers
(API) both. (I have to admit I haven't looked into HAL. What was that link
again? :) )

&gt; Are these read/write applications or just read?

Read and write.

&gt; Do you have many external clients to your application?

Yes, hundreds.

&gt; Did any of them
&gt; have no experience with RDF before interacting with your application?

Don't know, but I'm pretty sure the answer is 'yes'.

&gt; If so how did the 'on-boarding' process go for them wrt RDF?

I don't rely on RDF, I only use it to expose the ontology, but that is
available in many different formats, including Topic Maps, generic XML and
JSON, and text. Don't think of RDF in the means of graph theory, though.
It's more like a vocabulary and relationships mapped up as an API.

&gt;

No. It's key because those semantics are really being broadcast to
humans (developers writing the consuming agents' logic). If I produce
an hypertext application and expose its semantics as an 'ontology',
those semantics will be consumed by developers first and foremost in
order to develop their understanding of the way the application flows.
The developers will then crystalize that understanding into code which
will fulfil the application on their behalf (aka an 'agent' or
'client' to the application). The important thing there is that the
exchange of application semantics occurred between the human author
and the human consumer of the application; this is where the
coaxing/herding takes place - it's a form of social engineering. This
is why the mechanical semantics of HTML or AtomPub are written in
human language.

A link relation provides a standard level of indirection; developers
can refer to them as they construct an understanding of the semantics
of a set of links which comprise an application, and the automated
agents they create can use them as tokens for distinguishing the links
in mechanising the developer's understanding. I use a generic media
type to and expose my application as a set of link relations, I can
then evolve my application by making non-breaking changes to the
semantics of existing links, or inject brand new or breaking semantics
by introducing new link relations - link relations are much more
granular and easier to control than media types in this regard, which
is why I design applications that way.

I don't think it needs to get more complex than that, and I'm not 100%
on whether that lack of complexity fails to satisfy the definition of
an "ontology"

&gt;&gt; not very fond 'ontology' though because the word stinks a bit of

As an application author my concern would be that presenting my
application to client developers as an 'ontology' would either confuse
them or scare them off completely. But, like I said, I don't think the
word we use matters /that/ much.

think you may have missed my point a bit here. I wasn't saying there
is anything actually 'wrong' with forms, just that introducing them to
a machine app is (for the time being) a costly and mostly fruitless

adding a requirement to understand form processing rules) without
delivering much by way of improving evolvability - it doesn't bring
much to the table, and many clients will either get it wrong or hack
around it anyway. This may well improve in the future but right now it

A benefit of forms is that they can provide data to include in the corresponding submission that needs not or must not (due to volatility) be remembered by the client.

An example would be the current price of an item. Instead of constructing an order and including a remembered price, the current price can be right in the form for the client to review and then put into the submission request.

I was sort of against forms, but Ian S. Robinson totally changed my mind on this about a year ago when pointing the above out to me.

&gt;
This is possible without forms by making the carried values a part of the
necessary representations and making the client behaviour (carrying the
value) part of the 'domain application protocol'. The difference with forms
is that the information that the client can potentially carry is arbitrary
with forms as far as the client is concerned, and the control of the
resultant request is completely in the hands of the server presenting the
initial form.

There is a pretty serious security implication of this approach, in that
the integrity of the client's request is lost to the server which in many
cases will belong to an external organisation. I imagine this would raise
security concerns about how far (if at all) such a mechanism should be
allowed to go; e.g. requiring a same-domain policy or removing the ability
for additional, arbitrary inputs to be injected into the resulting request.
These sorts of measures would make a big dent in the benefits of taking the
form approach. If half of your clients were ok with that, and the other
half weren't - could you really make significant changes to those forms
(e.g. changing the domain or adding in another field) and be confident
about the risks?

I do not refer to generic forms. A form is any syntactical construct that instructs the user agent what data to include in the submission (including fixed (aka 'hidden')) values. My forms would simply be an inherent part of the specific media type(s) I define.

Why's that? The server can easily check whether the submitted price is a price it accepts. The server need not carelessly send the order to the backend without a check. But, ok, yes - a check-key could be used to verify the data came from a form actually created by the server.

Good question.

To me, this is a matter of who is remembering state. Does the client remember all the aspects of an offer to build the order or is the offer a resource that the client can GET and is then given the offer-data as a submittable form?

&gt; Yes.

&gt;  &gt; Let's have a resource, which accepts "image/png" on POST and does

&gt; I would say the link-reltype that points to the page that accepts the POST.
&gt;
&gt; The link-reltypes would be documented in the media-type spec.
&gt;
&gt; It could go like this:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Client GETs image processing descriptor resource.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Server returns media-type "application/vnd.imageprocessor+xml". Now
&gt; the client has a shared understanding with server about the server's

&gt;
&gt; 3) The client selects a proper link from the response using
&gt; link-reltypes documented in the media-type spec.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Reasons to use forms<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>from my POV, using inline client-side "templates" for URIs or entity
bodies makes sense when the problem domain you are implementing has a
substantially high number of variables for either URIs and/or entity
bodies _and_ you want to inform clients at runtime of the possible
options for URIs and.or bodies..

HTML took on the task of providing both URI and entity bodie
termplates by providing the exact same mechanism:  HTML.FORM, but
adding a single "switch". that is, for HTML.FORM@method="get", client
apps are to treat the FORM as a URI template; otherwise, the client
apps are to treat the FORM as an entity body template.

Atom solved this problem by dropping support for templates completely;
servers simply have no way (as defined by Atom/AtomPub) to inform
clients at runtime of any state-transfer option details (other than
identified links such as rel="edit", etc.). this works fine for
problem domains where the options are either non-existent, or the list
of options are simple/stable enough to hard-code all details of each
and every possible option (including _when_ these options are valid)
into the client apps directly.

while it's true that machine-only clients (i.e. no active human in the
driver seat) have additional work to do when supporting templating, i
rarely find this "additional work" is wasted energy. i've been able to
use HTML.FORMs to very good effect in M2M scenarios several times.
this works especially well when the _vocabulary_ of the problem domain
is stable, while the _workflow_ options of the problem domain are
variable/customizable. IOW, machines do not need to learn *new
variables* over time, but instead need to learn *new collections* of
the same variables (i.e. the number of FORMs encountered and the list
of variables in each FORM changes over time, but none of these changes
introduces *unknown* variables to the machine).

A benefit of forms is that they can provide data to include in the corresponding submission that needs not or must not (due to volatility) be remembered by the client.

An example would be the current price of an item. Instead of constructing an order and including a remembered price, the current price can be right in the form for the client to review and then put into the submission request.


This is possible without forms by making the carried values a part of the necessary representations and making the client behaviour (carrying the value) part of the 'domain application protocol'. The difference with forms is that the information that the client can potentially carry is arbitrary with forms as far as the client is concerned, and the control of the resultant request is completely in the hands of the server presenting the initial form.

There is a pretty serious security implication of this approach, in that the integrity of the client's request is lost to the server which in many cases will belong to an external organisation. I imagine this would raise security concerns about how far (if at all) such a mechanism should be allowed to go; e.g. requiring a same-domain policy or removing the ability for additional, arbitrary inputs to be injected into the resulting request. These sorts of measures would make a big dent in the benefits of taking the form approach. If half of your clients were ok with that, and the other half weren't - could you really make significant changes to those forms (e.g. changing the domain or adding in another field) and be confident about the risks?

Cheers,
Mike

That's the pipe we're trying to flow through.

&gt; If I produce
&gt; an hypertext application and expose its semantics as an 'ontology',
&gt; those semantics will be consumed by developers first and foremost in
&gt; order to develop their understanding of the way the application flows.

No, not necessarily, and this is key to the whole semantic schmantic web;
understand a basic part of the ontology (so, the parts that touch the edges
of its API) to avoid needing to know the whole. Derived ontologies infer
from context their applicability, and one can map objects and relationships
to workflows more easily than you can use a traditional API.

Example; My app and your app both speak a small ontology about business
interaction (basic entities, for example). These apps are obviously made by
developers, but here's the clinch; if you speak that ontology, those maps
of your data you've got can be directly reused in more complex frameworks
where underlying ontologies are derived from the basic ontology. An objects
type follows through the ontology, where relationships are specified and
can be acted upon. It basically means that objects that you've defined as
type X can be popped into other systems, and interaction can happen,
without any further devs involved.

More specifically, there's ontologies for working with semantics within
maps, and some apps can enrich your data without any devs. It enables the
creation of evolving ontologies for your applications domain and scope.

&gt; I don't think it needs to get more complex than that, and I'm not 100%
&gt; on whether that lack of complexity fails to satisfy the definition of
&gt; an "ontology"

Ontology is the language you use; the entities you've got, their types, and
the relationships between them. You can make that as complex or simple as
you need, but of course even more subscribe to reuse of models.

&gt; &gt; It has a defined use in information technology, so get used to it. :)
&gt;
&gt; As an application author my concern would be that presenting my
&gt; application to client developers as an 'ontology' would either confuse
&gt; them or scare them off completely. But, like I said, I don't think the
&gt; word we use matters /that/ much.

Call it vocabulary, and relationships. If client developers don't get this,
I suggest you need better clients. :)

&gt; think you may have missed my point a bit here. I wasn't saying there
&gt; is anything actually 'wrong' with forms, just that introducing them to
&gt; a machine app is (for the time being) a costly and mostly fruitless
&gt; effort - it increases the complexity of consuming the application (by
&gt; adding a requirement to understand form processing rules) without
&gt; delivering much by way of improving evolvability - it doesn't bring
&gt; much to the table, and many clients will either get it wrong or hack
&gt; around it anyway.

this sounds ... profoundly wrong to me. Forms are costly and fruitless?
Increases complexities? What exactly is the difference between a form and
RPC call in terms of complexity and bloat?

&gt; This may well improve in the future but right now it
&gt; doesn't seem like a good option from the practical, cost-benefit point
&gt; of view (not the architecturally pure one).

The concept is that the server can prepare and ready-make forms that the
client can choose to instigate on and possibly fill out some blanks if they
exists. The client doesn't need any pre-defined concept of the API; it is
delivered to you, and whether parameters are required, optional, what their
semantic weight is, and so on. You've gt in forms both a
machine-understandable and human-interactionable, self-documenting, and so
on. The client focus more on the entities and relationships between things
(concepts that are rarely to change) rather than the ins and outs of an API
(that might change in the future, causing headaches).

Anyway, I don't think we disagree too much, just on a few reusable things.
:)

Yes, there seems to be a slight confusion as to why reuse HTML forms. The
main one is that both humans and machines can read it, the server can
pre-make forms the client can use, and thus can be fully self-documenting,
act as a guide through a framework/API, can be browsed, tons of tooling and
knowledge about form interactions, and so on.

You could go the extra mile and do Xforms, but I haven't had the need for
the full monty just quite yet. Basic XHTML forms seems to be quite capable
for most uses.

I agree that the potential for re-using/re-mixing code written against
applications is improved by defining the application in terms of link
relations (vs. domain specific media types). That is one of the key
reasons I prefer generic media types, so we definitely agree on that.
However, I don't follow your logic about this re-use somehow
overcoming a need for human interaction; since the applications and
code being re-used had to be created by /people/ expressing (author
dev) and comprehending (consumer dev) the semantics in the first
place.

That being the case, where does that leave us wrt your previous
statement: "As long as humans who create programs know how to deal

intervention"?

I think you are over-stating the importance of machines wrt the actual
applications - perhaps this is a general semweb thing?

I find it easiest to think about hypertext applications in terms of
'agent intent'. The job of application semantics are to instruct
agents how their intent should translate into interactions with a
server.  In the case of machine agents - their intent is actually the
codified intent of their developers, so the semantics should speak to
those developer(s) since they are the ones performing the translation
into the codified interactions the machine agent is performing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It has a defined use in information technology, so get used to it. :)

&gt; the semantics of entities and their relationships _are_ the
&gt; application?

Hmm, we're getting a tad off-topic, but I always welcome a dive into data
modeling (and not the RDBMS kind). As with most data modeling, it's about
defining entities and relationships. Entities in an ontology are mostly
"type", ie. abstract notions that you declare your data to be a type of, so
for example the ontology will have "person", and a data specific definition
would be "Alex" is_a "person", and so on. And when they're not a type,
they're a relationship, like "is_a". More complex ontologies have a lot of
constraints right in it, so for example objects of type "person" must have
a relationship X attached to it, or never in a relationship with an object
of type Y, and on and on. From all of this you create a model of your
domain, and link your data to that model.

But these are still conceptual things (objects and ontologies) that I don't
necessarily map directly to HTTP resources and link relationships, but more
on that later. But now more directly to your question, then of course in an
ideal world we all do semantic mapping in our applications, re-use a good
few ontologies, and things woud be much smoother, and yes, a hyper-text
business process definitly has entities and relationships that we could map
to resources ... but it isn't always what you want to do, especially not
the fine-grained details of a full business model. Not saying you can't,
and I have done it before, but mostly I do a more abstract mapping between
resources that represent a cluster of entities and relationships, and then
tunnel the business models through that. (This was harder to explain than
it should be, and I may not be making much sense, either)

&gt; Are there any practical examples of applications that actually work
&gt; this way? Can any of them be easily comprehended and coded against by
&gt; average devs (i.e. devs that aren't semweb Zen-masters)?

I don't know much about industries doing this (I've seen papers at
conferences, and I've talked to people who are doing or wanted to do this,
but no real details on that), only what I myself have been doing for
clients and for back-end systems I can't reveal much about (and I wish I
could; it's not a cop out :) ). As to the need for Zen-masters, no, but I
do find that there's a good percentage of people who can't think in any
term that doesn't include a table and rows. Models, be it complex or
otherwise, seems to be easier understood by certain people, and that surely
impacts who does it well. Having said that, though, the tons of truly
crappy relational modeling I've seen through the years tell me that
modeling in *general* is misunderstood, and not just the semantic modeling
that's a little bit more fashionable these days.

&gt; &gt; More specifically, there's ontologies for working with semantics within
&gt; &gt; maps, and some apps can enrich your data without any devs. It enables
the
&gt; &gt; creation of evolving ontologies for your applications domain and scope.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; code being re-used had to be created by /people/ expressing (author
&gt; dev) and comprehending (consumer dev) the semantics in the first
&gt; place.

Well, it's not so much that I think it will remove devs from app design
completely, but I sure think it could offer an applicable revolution in the
way apps interact. Like I said, instead of writing your app to understand
given APIs that are bound to change, write them towards models that are
less likely to change. An example is again "Alex" is_a "person". If "Alex"
is an object with a host of properties attached, any piece of code who can
understand and process objects of type "person" can have a go at it. The
key is also that "Pedro" is_a "customer" can run the same code; "customer"
is_a "person" is defined in perhaps some middle ontology, making objects
constrained and / or compatible against other through merging of ontologies.

In other words, I can create a service in my SOA that understands how to
deal with "person" objects. Maybe it searches the web, and attaches certain
data to objects that correlates, and adds properties or relationships to
*other* objects. Little by little you can enrich your original "person"
object by, say, changing its type from "person" to "human being" or
"company" (in liue of the crazy US definition that companies have personal
rights :) ). You pass around the same object, but different processes apply
to their typification.

People objects are one thing, but say you start out with something more
abstract, like "transaction"; you pass the object around, and it gets
enriched as it passes through your system. Same object, different
processes, driven by the objects type relationship and how it fits into
your model. (Different rules if your object has X relationship rather than
a Y)

And now we come to the reusability aspect more directly. I can send a
"person" object through your system if you understand "person" objects, and
you can enrich it with stuff I don't support under the surface. For
example, let's say that the upper ontology defines "person", and maybe
basic date of birth and death. Your service finds out that I love
Monteverdi, and adds this relationship and others in your special music
ontology (which I don't support), like the subjects "opera" and "vespers".
I can't deal much with these relationships because I don't understand them
(I only understand the upper ontology we share). However, I can infer from
type "composer" that it is a person, and I can infer generic subjects from
special subject "vespers". So I can give an unprocessed view of objects,
and even do business logic across them, inferred from the layers of
typification.

In a business context this is fantastic for transaction handling shared
between clients back and forth. But none of this has much to do with REST,
of course.

&gt; I think you are over-stating the importance of machines wrt the actual
&gt; applications - perhaps this is a general semweb thing?

It's definitly the way the semweb is going, and one usually separate
between upper, core and data ontologies. Upper deals with the semantics of
language, core with a mapping between concepts and real life, and the data
ontologies map between data and the concepts. Sharing of ontologies are
getting traction, too, but mostly of data ontologies, sharing models and
trying to map them to either intermediate platforms. The library world is
modeling up FRBR and RDA, for example, which will finally free them to
share different models of their bibliographical data through a more fluid
ontology layer rather than the hard-coded MARC[21] / AACR2 nightmare
they're currently in.

&gt; I find it easiest to think about hypertext applications in terms of
&gt; 'agent intent'.

Well, yes, but who is the agent? It's not always a person on the other end.

&gt; &gt; Call it vocabulary, and relationships. If client developers don't get
this,
&gt; &gt; I suggest you need better clients. :)
&gt;
&gt; Is it ok if I use "representations" and "link relations" instead?

Well, you can of course do what you want, and you don't need my permission
... :) Representation is one of those ugly words, though, that we can't
seem to all agree on, and I hardly think it smart to represent everything
in a model as a resource ... and then you get into problems of clustering
(named graphs) and so on. Ugh. Link relations are a bit easier, though.

Talking with devs I simply call them objects. SemWeb people call them
nodes. Topic Mappers call them topics. And I guess RESTafarians could call
them resources, but that distinction between a resource and the
representation is a bit close to the fundamental problem of RDF of
"aboutness" when you use an URI for it; are you talking about the website,
the resource or whatever that resource is meant to represent? It's still an
unresolved problem (the 304 solution is an ugly hack)

IMHO, of course.

Alex

Mike, I share your opinion. I think that Sematic Web technologies provide a

I'm actively working on this, see http://bit.ly/seredasj,

&gt; the notion of expressing a problem domain independent of the message

&gt; IMO, not easy to accomplish. i've taken a couple stabs at it over the

I would love to know more about your efforts..

Hi Markus, the main reasons I can think of are that it's:

<pre>Hi Markus,

at a first glance your referred papers are looking very promising. They 
remind me to a discussion we had appr. one year ago about the 
REST-i-ness of SPARQL (see [1]).
However, the problem with JSON-LD still is, that it doesn't utilise link 
relation types (as it is the same problem with all RDF serialisation 
formats ATM). In contrast, HAL makes use of link relations types 
("href", ...), and, hence, supports the HATEOAS constraint of REST.
So my solution proposal for this problem still is to design a vocabulary 
to describe link relation type definitions in a machine processable way 
and attach these definitions to our well-known RDF property definitions, 
i.e., then we have knowledge about the property (relation) itself and 
how it can be processed by a client.

Cheers,


Bo

&gt; Hi Markus, the main reasons I can think of are that it's:
&gt; 
&gt; - not RDF

JSON-LD is not RDF, it is just a way to serialize directed graphs which
really resembles data on the Web IMHO - think of entities/resources/nodes
(or whatever you like to call them) interconnected by links. Since RDF is
capable of doing the same, it is trivial to transform JSON-LD to RDF - the
same applies to CSV e.g.

A lot of effort was put into hiding RDF as much as possible, I am just one
of the proponents to take that as far as possible but we also have people
thinking more in RDF in the group.



&gt; - deliberately designed to be minimal and easy to grok

These are explicit design goals of JSON-LD [1] as well.

<pre>Hi,

Why do you think JSON-LD doesn't utilize link relations? They are just more
terse. Let's look at an example:

{
  "@context": {
    "homepage": { "@id": http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type": "@id"
}
    }
  },
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
}


This (incomplete) JSON-LD document would tell you that there's a JSON object
which has a key "homepage" that represents a homepage according to the FOAF
vocabulary - that's the rel part, isn't it!? The value of it is
"http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/". The coercion in the context tells a
JSON-LD parser that it is an IRI and not just a string and thus allows a
client to follow that link.

See also Manu Sporny's comment on Mark Notthingsham's blog post about
"Linking in JSON" [1]. I think there is still some confusion about what
JSON-LD is (intended to be).

<pre>Hi Markus,

link relation type definition are not (RDF) property definitions. Where 
the latter ones define something about the properties (relations) it 
themselves, the former ones include something about the processing of 
these relations, i.e., how to handle the referred object.
To sum up, link relation type definitions are usually orthogonal to 
(RDF) property definitions. See also, e.g., [1] for a detailed 
discussion on this issue and related ones.

Cheers,


Bo

Hi Markus,

Being 'more terse' here is an example of the convolution I referred to before that you don't get with HAL.

what's the simplest way of representing an 'embedded resource' with JSON-LD?

I tried to roughly translate the HAL example at [1] to JSON-LD markup:

{
     "@context": {
		"ex": "http://example.com",
         "ex:customer": {
             "@type": "@id"
         },
         "ex:quantity": {
             "@type": "xsd:integer"
         },
         "ex:price": {
             "@type": "xsd:float"
		},
		"ex:total": {
             "@type": "xsd:float"
		},
		"ex:placed": {
             "@type": "xsd:date"
		},
         "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
     },
	"@id": "/orders",
	"@type": "ex:Orders",
	"ex:order": {
		"@id":	"/orders/123"
		"@type": "ex:Order",
		"ex:customer": "/customer/bob",
		"ex:basket": {
			"@id": "/orderds/123/basket",
			"@type": "ex:Basket",
			"ex:item": {
				"@type": "ex:Item",
				"ex:sku": "ABC123",
				"ex:quantity": "2",
				"ex:price": "9.50"
			},
			"ex:item": {
				"@type": "ex:Item",
				"ex:sku": "GFZT111",
				"ex:quantity": "1",
				"ex:price": "11.00"
			},
		},
		"ex:total": "30.00",
		"ex:currency": "USD",
		"ex:status": "shipped",
		"ex:placed": "2011-01-16"
	},
	"ex:order": {
		"@id":	"/orders/124"
		"@type": "ex:Order",
		"ex:customer": "/customer/jen",
		"ex:basket": {
			"@id": "/orderds/124/basket",
			"@type": "ex:Basket",
			"ex:item": {
				"@type": "ex:Item",
				"ex:sku": "KLM222",
				"ex:quantity": "1",
				"ex:price": "9.00"
			},
			"ex:item": {
				"@type": "ex:Item",
				"ex:sku": "HHI50",
				"ex:quantity": "1",
				"ex:price": "11.00"
			},
		},
		"ex:total": "20.00",
		"ex:currency": "USD",
		"ex:status": "processing",
		"ex:placed": "2011-01-16"
	}
}

See also [2].

I'm no JSON-LD expert at all. So there are maybe some errors in the 
markup above. Furthermore, I guess, this example can even be shortened. 
A hyperlink relation is simply expressed via its coercion (as pointed by 
Markus), e.g., "ex:customer": "/customer/jen" would be a link relation. 
An 'embedded resource' is in this example, e.g., "/orders/124". The 
JSON-LD knowledge representation is even more expressive, since it 
includes resource and literal types (which, I guess, are optional).
All property and resource type definitions should be de-referencable 
themselves.

Cheers,


Bo


PS: Where are the link relation type definitions of your HAL example?

<pre>Hi,

Yes, this is a good translation to JSON-LD. Probably you would define terms
for the JSON-LD document instead of using the "ex" prefix for every field.
Also, as you mentioned, the type coercions are optional (JSON-LD handles the
native JSON types automatically).

The advantage of such an approach is that you can look up the "rel"
definitions whereas in other approaches they are (usually) just tokens
defined somewhere out of band. If you don't know where you can find the API
description you will have hard times understanding them.

&gt; 		"ex:placed": {

&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; See also [2].
&gt; 
&gt; I'm no JSON-LD expert at all. So there are maybe some errors in the
&gt; markup above. Furthermore, I guess, this example can even be shortened.
&gt; A hyperlink relation is simply expressed via its coercion (as pointed
&gt; by
&gt; Markus), e.g., "ex:customer": "/customer/jen" would be a link relation.
&gt; An 'embedded resource' is in this example, e.g., "/orders/124". The
&gt; JSON-LD knowledge representation is even more expressive, since it
&gt; includes resource and literal types (which, I guess, are optional).
&gt; All property and resource type definitions should be de-referencable
&gt; themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

<pre>Bob,

I've read the thread you referenced but I still don't understand why link
relations should any different. A predicate (or a labeled edge in a graph)
does nothing else than connecting two (data) nodes. If I know the
relationship of node B to node A I also know how to process it or if I would
be interested in following that link.

&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; 
&gt; link relation type definition are not (RDF) property definitions. Where
&gt; the latter ones define something about the properties (relations) it
&gt; themselves, the former ones include something about the processing of
&gt; these relations, i.e., how to handle the referred object.
&gt; To sum up, link relation type definitions are usually orthogonal to
&gt; (RDF) property definitions. See also, e.g., [1] for a detailed
&gt; discussion on this issue and related ones.

&gt; &gt; This (incomplete) JSON-LD document would tell you that there's a JSON

&gt; &gt; which has a key "homepage" that represents a homepage according to
&gt; the FOAF

&gt; &gt; "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/". The coercion in the context tells
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; JSON-LD parser that it is an IRI and not just a string and thus
&gt; allows a
&gt; &gt; client to follow that link.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; See also Manu Sporny's comment on Mark Notthingsham's blog post about
&gt; &gt; "Linking in JSON" [1]. I think there is still some confusion about

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; at a first glance your referred papers are looking very promising.
&gt; They
&gt; &gt;  &gt; remind me to a discussion we had appr. one year ago about the
&gt; &gt;  &gt; REST-i-ness of SPARQL (see [1]).
&gt; &gt;  &gt; However, the problem with JSON-LD still is, that it doesn't
&gt; utilise
&gt; &gt;  &gt; link
&gt; &gt;  &gt; relation types (as it is the same problem with all RDF
&gt; serialisation
&gt; &gt;  &gt; formats ATM). In contrast, HAL makes use of link relations types
&gt; &gt;  &gt; ("href", ...), and, hence, supports the HATEOAS constraint of
&gt; REST.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; So my solution proposal for this problem still is to design a
&gt; &gt;  &gt; vocabulary
&gt; &gt;  &gt; to describe link relation type definitions in a machine
&gt; processable way
&gt; &gt;  &gt; and attach these definitions to our well-known RDF property
&gt; &gt;  &gt; definitions,
&gt; &gt;  &gt; i.e., then we have knowledge about the property (relation) itself
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;  &gt; how it can be processed by a client.

<pre>Initially I included CURIEs in HAL with a _curies property, and used it in
some examples. I've since removed it on the basis that it is not
particularly useful, people apparently found the colon syntax
confusing/alarming.

There are a few ways to achieve discoverable rels. The first is to simply
use URIs for the link relations. Another approach is to make sure that the
documentation for your application is linked from the entry point of your
app, and explains where the rel tokens can be found in the documentation
(i.e. URI generation).

Probably the 'best' approach would be to have a URI template presented at
the entry point which instructs clients how CURIEs should be built, i.e:

request:
GET /

response:
{
...
  "_links" : {
    "curie": { "href": "http://example.com/rels/{relation}", "title": "ex" }
  },
...
}

which would instruct the client on how to resolve the 'CURIEs' elsewhere in
your application, e.g:

{
...
  "_links" : {
    "ex:foo" : { "href": "/bar" }
  },
...
}

This uses URI templates, and the title property of the link to emulate
CURIEs without having to burden everyone using HAL with an extra CURIE
mechanism.

Cheers,
Mike

&gt; &gt; I'm no JSON-LD expert at all. So there are maybe some errors in the
&gt; &gt; markup above. Furthermore, I guess, this example can even be shortened.
&gt; &gt; A hyperlink relation is simply expressed via its coercion (as pointed
&gt; &gt; by
&gt; &gt; Markus), e.g., "ex:customer": "/customer/jen" would be a link relation.
&gt; &gt; An 'embedded resource' is in this example, e.g., "/orders/124". The
&gt; &gt; JSON-LD knowledge representation is even more expressive, since it
&gt; &gt; includes resource and literal types (which, I guess, are optional).
&gt; &gt; All property and resource type definitions should be de-referencable
&gt; &gt; themselves.

<pre>Hi Markus,

well, from my POV (a Semantic Web biased one), I would agree. However, I 
always got and get the impression that the REST/hypermedia community 
doesn't agree on this equation*.
I guess, it has something to do with the hypermedia support that 
surrounds the utilisation of link relation types, i.e. they are values 
of rel attributes of tags, e.g., "link", "a", or "area". These tags and 
their attributes define the processing (e.g. enc-type, method, ...) of 
referred resources (in the media type definition). Furthermore, in such 
a hypermedia context a client should know whether it is a navigational 
link, an embedded link, etc.
On the other side, RDF is a data model or knowledge representation 
structure, which should be embeddable into other existing hypermedia 
media types (as it already can done with RDFa, see XHTML+RDFa). So RDF 
serialisation (/representation) formats doesn't need this 
functionalities themselves.
I somehow believe that is better, if these two concerns are separable 
and one could mix them as needed, because not every client needs the 
knowledge of the underlying resource/model description.

Cheers,


Bo


*) which is so obvious from my POV :) (because it's all about binary 
relations in that context)

&gt;  &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; link relation type definition are not (RDF) property definitions. Where
&gt;  &gt; the latter ones define something about the properties (relations) it
&gt;  &gt; themselves, the former ones include something about the processing of
&gt;  &gt; these relations, i.e., how to handle the referred object.
&gt;  &gt; To sum up, link relation type definitions are usually orthogonal to
&gt;  &gt; (RDF) property definitions. See also, e.g., [1] for a detailed
&gt;  &gt; discussion on this issue and related ones.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Why do you think JSON-LD doesn't utilize link relations? They are

&gt;  &gt; &gt; terse. Let's look at an example:
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; {
&gt;  &gt; &gt; "@context": {
&gt;  &gt; &gt; "homepage": { "@id": http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type":

&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; This (incomplete) JSON-LD document would tell you that there's a JSON
&gt;  &gt; object
&gt;  &gt; &gt; which has a key "homepage" that represents a homepage according to
&gt;  &gt; the FOAF
&gt;  &gt; &gt; vocabulary - that's the rel part, isn't it!? The value of it is
&gt;  &gt; &gt; "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/". The coercion in the context tells
&gt;  &gt; a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; JSON-LD parser that it is an IRI and not just a string and thus
&gt;  &gt; allows a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; client to follow that link.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; See also Manu Sporny's comment on Mark Notthingsham's blog post about
&gt;  &gt; &gt; "Linking in JSON" [1]. I think there is still some confusion about

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; at a first glance your referred papers are looking very promising.
&gt;  &gt; They
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; remind me to a discussion we had appr. one year ago about the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; REST-i-ness of SPARQL (see [1]).
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the problem with JSON-LD still is, that it doesn't
&gt;  &gt; utilise
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; link
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; relation types (as it is the same problem with all RDF
&gt;  &gt; serialisation
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; formats ATM). In contrast, HAL makes use of link relations types
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ("href", ...), and, hence, supports the HATEOAS constraint of
&gt;  &gt; REST.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; So my solution proposal for this problem still is to design a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; vocabulary
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to describe link relation type definitions in a machine
&gt;  &gt; processable way
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and attach these definitions to our well-known RDF property
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions,
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; i.e., then we have knowledge about the property (relation) itself
&gt;  &gt; and
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; how it can be processed by a client.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; I somehow believe that is better, if these two concerns are separable
&gt; and one could mix them as needed, because not every client needs the
&gt; knowledge of the underlying resource/model description.
&lt;/snip&gt;

From my POV, a key diff between RDF message designs and hypermedia
message designs is that RDF design focuses on domain-level semantics
and hypermedia design focuses on protocol-level semantics,

Without too much trouble, I have been able to design hypermedia types
that _also_ express domain semantics (i.e. domain-specific elements,
attributes, etc.) that a wide range of clients can consume (even those
who are not "interested in" the domain semantics available in the
hypermedia type).

However, I've not yet been able to design an RDF media type that
_also_ expresses protocol-level semantics (i.e. navigate|embed,
protocol method, body|uri variables, idempotency, etc.) that a wide
range of clients can consume (even those not "interested in" the
protocol semantics available in the RDF media type).

RDFa seems to come the closest to mixing both design goals and it
starts from the hypermedia design then adds RDF elements.  I haven't
found an inverse of the RDFa model.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; at a first glance your referred papers are looking very promising.
&gt;&gt;  &gt; They
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; remind me to a discussion we had appr. one year ago about the
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; REST-i-ness of SPARQL (see [1]).
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the problem with JSON-LD still is, that it doesn't
&gt;&gt;  &gt; utilise
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; link
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; relation types (as it is the same problem with all RDF
&gt;&gt;  &gt; serialisation
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; formats ATM). In contrast, HAL makes use of link relations types
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ("href", ...), and, hence, supports the HATEOAS constraint of
&gt;&gt;  &gt; REST.
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; So my solution proposal for this problem still is to design a
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; vocabulary
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to describe link relation type definitions in a machine
&gt;&gt;  &gt; processable way
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and attach these definitions to our well-known RDF property
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions,
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; i.e., then we have knowledge about the property (relation) itself
&gt;&gt;  &gt; and
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; how it can be processed by a client.
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; However, I've not yet been able to design an RDF media type that

&gt; range of clients can consume (even those not "interested in" the
&gt; protocol semantics available in the RDF media type).

I don't think i understand the issues you mention.

 * I dont know what you mean by "navigate|embed" means. If i have an
HTTP link to a resource then i can, by virtue of the uniform
interface, try to navigate to that url. If the resource does not
support GET it will respond with 405. Embedding is a very different
issue that seem deeply related to the media type. For example it is
trivial with RDF-ish media types and impossible with HTML (at least
formally).

 * I am not sure why protocol method is important. We have the uniform
interface so any method may be called on any resource. It might be a
useful hint sometimes but is it every required?

 * I don't know of any form-ish vocabularies for RDF, but it doesn't
seem like that would be all that difficult to implement. That being
said, i don't feel like that not having forms is a show stopper for a
media type.

 * Idempotency is defined by the uniform interface (at least in HTTP),
not by the media type. Why would a media type need to encode this type
of information?

Maybe i am missing your point?

I don't know if RDF-ish approaches are a good way to build RESTful
HTTP systems but they seem like they might be. `@rel` really is very
similar to the property id in RDF. Otherwise RDFa would not be able to
use it for that purpose so effortlessly.

I suppose RDF does make finding navigable links in a tad more
difficult. You have to look at all the properties and find the ones
whose value is a resource, rather than having a separate list of
properties with resources as values vs properties with other types of
values. OTOH, I have always thought it weird that the REST community
treats links a magically special. Unifying the model make me more
comfortable: a link is nothing more, or less, than a property of a
resource whose value is another resource.

Peter

&gt; RDFa seems to come the closest to mixing both design goals and it
&gt; starts from the hypermedia design then adds RDF elements.  I haven't
&gt; found an inverse of the RDFa model.

&gt;&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; well, from my POV (a Semantic Web biased one), I would agree. However, I
&gt;&gt; always got and get the impression that the REST/hypermedia community
&gt;&gt; doesn't agree on this equation*.
&gt;&gt; I guess, it has something to do with the hypermedia support that
&gt;&gt; surrounds the utilisation of link relation types, i.e. they are values
&gt;&gt; of rel attributes of tags, e.g., "link", "a", or "area". These tags and
&gt;&gt; their attributes define the processing (e.g. enc-type, method, ...) of
&gt;&gt; referred resources (in the media type definition). Furthermore, in such
&gt;&gt; a hypermedia context a client should know whether it is a navigational
&gt;&gt; link, an embedded link, etc.
&gt;&gt; On the other side, RDF is a data model or knowledge representation
&gt;&gt; structure, which should be embeddable into other existing hypermedia
&gt;&gt; media types (as it already can done with RDFa, see XHTML+RDFa). So RDF
&gt;&gt; serialisation (/representation) formats doesn't need this
&gt;&gt; functionalities themselves.
&gt;&gt; I somehow believe that is better, if these two concerns are separable
&gt;&gt; and one could mix them as needed, because not every client needs the
&gt;&gt; knowledge of the underlying resource/model description.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; *) which is so obvious from my POV :) (because it's all about binary
&gt;&gt; relations in that context)
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; hypermedia, see http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the thread you referenced but I still don't understand why link
&gt;&gt;&gt; relations should any different. A predicate (or a labeled edge in a graph)
&gt;&gt;&gt; does nothing else than connecting two (data) nodes. If I know the
&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship of node B to node A I also know how to process it or if I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be interested in following that link.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; link relation type definition are not (RDF) property definitions. Where
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; the latter ones define something about the properties (relations) it
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; themselves, the former ones include something about the processing of
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; these relations, i.e., how to handle the referred object.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; To sum up, link relation type definitions are usually orthogonal to
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; (RDF) property definitions. See also, e.g., [1] for a detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; discussion on this issue and related ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; Why do you think JSON-LD doesn't utilize link relations? They are
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; just more
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; terse. Let's look at an example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; {
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "@context": {
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "homepage": { "@id": http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type":
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; "@id"
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; },
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; This (incomplete) JSON-LD document would tell you that there's a JSON
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; object
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; which has a key "homepage" that represents a homepage according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; the FOAF
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; vocabulary - that's the rel part, isn't it!? The value of it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/". The coercion in the context tells
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; JSON-LD parser that it is an IRI and not just a string and thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; allows a
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; client to follow that link.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; See also Manu Sporny's comment on Mark Notthingsham's blog post about
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "Linking in JSON" [1]. I think there is still some confusion about
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; JSON-LD is (intended to be).

<pre>Peter:

my comment here is not about designing messages where _all_
possibilities exist at _all_ times, but is instead about designing
messages where the server can indicate to the client what options are
available and valid "at this point in time." (i.e. you don't see the
"details" link in the message because you are not yet logged in" or
"you don't see the "markup for adding an invoice because you are not
authorized to do so" or 'You don't see the link for reports because
the reports are not yet avaialble" and so forth).

Here are some examples:
HTML.IMG
means "retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don't navigate to it)"

X.INCLUDE
means "retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don't navigate to it)"

HTML.A
means "navigate to the resource (don't embed it)"

ATOM.LINK@rel="alternate"
means "navigate to the resource (don't embed it)"

HTML.FORM@method=":get"
means "collect the arguments, construct a URI and navigate to that
resource using the HTTP method "get" (don't make a body w/ the args)"

HTML.FORM@method="post"
means "collect the arguments, construct a body and navigate to that
resource using the HTTP method "post" (don't construct a URI w/ the
args)"

ATOM:LINK@rel="edit"
means "use this link to PUT or DELETE the indicated resource using
guidlines set out in AtomPub

none of the RDF media types i have encountered have these affordances
built in; there is no universal way for servers to inform clients of
the valid/appropriate possibilities at any point in time. Clients must
have this information hard-coded instead.

FWIW, Mark Baker built the RDF Forms[1] ontology, but i've not seen
that in production use. I've seen an attempt to mimic HTTP GET &amp; POST
using an RDF conversion[1], but not seen that in production use.

&gt;&gt; However, I've not yet been able to design an RDF media type that
&gt;&gt; _also_ expresses protocol-level semantics (i.e. navigate|embed,

&gt;&gt; range of clients can consume (even those not "interested in" the
&gt;&gt; protocol semantics available in the RDF media type).
&gt;
&gt; I don't think i understand the issues you mention.
&gt;
&gt;  * I dont know what you mean by "navigate|embed" means. If i have an
&gt; HTTP link to a resource then i can, by virtue of the uniform
&gt; interface, try to navigate to that url. If the resource does not
&gt; support GET it will respond with 405. Embedding is a very different
&gt; issue that seem deeply related to the media type. For example it is
&gt; trivial with RDF-ish media types and impossible with HTML (at least
&gt; formally).
&gt;
&gt;  * I am not sure why protocol method is important. We have the uniform
&gt; interface so any method may be called on any resource. It might be a
&gt; useful hint sometimes but is it every required?
&gt;
&gt;  * I don't know of any form-ish vocabularies for RDF, but it doesn't
&gt; seem like that would be all that difficult to implement. That being
&gt; said, i don't feel like that not having forms is a show stopper for a
&gt; media type.
&gt;
&gt;  * Idempotency is defined by the uniform interface (at least in HTTP),
&gt; not by the media type. Why would a media type need to encode this type
&gt; of information?
&gt;
&gt; Maybe i am missing your point?
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if RDF-ish approaches are a good way to build RESTful
&gt; HTTP systems but they seem like they might be. `@rel` really is very
&gt; similar to the property id in RDF. Otherwise RDFa would not be able to
&gt; use it for that purpose so effortlessly.
&gt;
&gt; I suppose RDF does make finding navigable links in a tad more
&gt; difficult. You have to look at all the properties and find the ones
&gt; whose value is a resource, rather than having a separate list of
&gt; properties with resources as values vs properties with other types of
&gt; values. OTOH, I have always thought it weird that the REST community
&gt; treats links a magically special. Unifying the model make me more
&gt; comfortable: a link is nothing more, or less, than a property of a
&gt; resource whose value is another resource.
&gt;
&gt; Peter
&gt;
&gt;&gt; RDFa seems to come the closest to mixing both design goals and it
&gt;&gt; starts from the hypermedia design then adds RDF elements.  I haven't
&gt;&gt; found an inverse of the RDFa model.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; well, from my POV (a Semantic Web biased one), I would agree. However, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; always got and get the impression that the REST/hypermedia community
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't agree on this equation*.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess, it has something to do with the hypermedia support that
&gt;&gt;&gt; surrounds the utilisation of link relation types, i.e. they are values
&gt;&gt;&gt; of rel attributes of tags, e.g., "link", "a", or "area". These tags and
&gt;&gt;&gt; their attributes define the processing (e.g. enc-type, method, ...) of
&gt;&gt;&gt; referred resources (in the media type definition). Furthermore, in such
&gt;&gt;&gt; a hypermedia context a client should know whether it is a navigational
&gt;&gt;&gt; link, an embedded link, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other side, RDF is a data model or knowledge representation
&gt;&gt;&gt; structure, which should be embeddable into other existing hypermedia
&gt;&gt;&gt; media types (as it already can done with RDFa, see XHTML+RDFa). So RDF
&gt;&gt;&gt; serialisation (/representation) formats doesn't need this
&gt;&gt;&gt; functionalities themselves.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I somehow believe that is better, if these two concerns are separable
&gt;&gt;&gt; and one could mix them as needed, because not every client needs the
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge of the underlying resource/model description.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; *) which is so obvious from my POV :) (because it's all about binary

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the thread you referenced but I still don't understand why link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relations should any different. A predicate (or a labeled edge in a graph)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does nothing else than connecting two (data) nodes. If I know the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship of node B to node A I also know how to process it or if I would

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; link relation type definition are not (RDF) property definitions. Where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; the latter ones define something about the properties (relations) it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; themselves, the former ones include something about the processing of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; these relations, i.e., how to handle the referred object.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; To sum up, link relation type definitions are usually orthogonal to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; (RDF) property definitions. See also, e.g., [1] for a detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; discussion on this issue and related ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; Why do you think JSON-LD doesn't utilize link relations? They are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; just more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; terse. Let's look at an example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; {
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "@context": {
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "homepage": { "@id": http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type":
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; "@id"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; },
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; This (incomplete) JSON-LD document would tell you that there's a JSON
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; object
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; which has a key "homepage" that represents a homepage according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; the FOAF
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; vocabulary - that's the rel part, isn't it!? The value of it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/". The coercion in the context tells
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; JSON-LD parser that it is an IRI and not just a string and thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; allows a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; client to follow that link.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; See also Manu Sporny's comment on Mark Notthingsham's blog post about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; "Linking in JSON" [1]. I think there is still some confusion about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; JSON-LD is (intended to be).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; at a first glance your referred papers are looking very promising.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; remind me to a discussion we had appr. one year ago about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; REST-i-ness of SPARQL (see [1]).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the problem with JSON-LD still is, that it doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; utilise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; relation types (as it is the same problem with all RDF
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; serialisation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; formats ATM). In contrast, HAL makes use of link relations types
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ("href", ...), and, hence, supports the HATEOAS constraint of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; REST.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; So my solution proposal for this problem still is to design a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; vocabulary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to describe link relation type definitions in a machine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; processable way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; and attach these definitions to our well-known RDF property
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; i.e., then we have knowledge about the property (relation) itself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; how it can be processed by a client.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;

My gut feeling is that retrieve vs navigate is a distinction without
much of a difference in the context of automated user agents. The
distinction is obviously important for certain clients (ie, browsers)
but not for others (ie, proxies, screen readers, etc).

&gt; HTML.A
&gt; means "navigate to the resource (don't embed it)"
&gt;
&gt; ATOM.LINK@rel="alternate"
&gt; means "navigate to the resource (don't embed it)"

Seems like most links are either the "navigate" flavor or have some
specific semantics to the user agent that could be specified with an
`@rel`. Given the markup nature of HTML it probably needs a special
form of link to "linkify some text". I don't see the need for more
than two kinds of links in HTML, and in more automata oriented formats
it seems that one flavor of link should be sufficient.

&gt; HTML.FORM@method=":get"
&gt; means "collect the arguments, construct a URI and navigate to that
&gt; resource using the HTTP method "get" (don't make a body w/ the args)"
&gt;
&gt; HTML.FORM@method="post"
&gt; means "collect the arguments, construct a body and navigate to that
&gt; resource using the HTTP method "post" (don't construct a URI w/ the
&gt; args)"

Yeah, uri template support and a form vocabulary would be useful.
However, may systems do not require that set of capabilities. I don't
see the method paramater as all that important.

A get form is really just a specification for how to render a UI for a
URI template. For an automated user agent such a specification is
superflous, the same thing can be accomplished with just a link whose
target is a URI template. (Possibly with a couple of extra resources
representing the set of valid values for the various options.)

Similarly, in the context of automated user agents, anything you can
do with a form, you can do without form by sufficiently specifying the
media type and/or relationships.

(Though in some situations a form might better than either of the
above choices.)

&gt; ATOM:LINK@rel="edit"
&gt; means "use this link to PUT or DELETE the indicated resource using
&gt; guidlines set out in AtomPub
&gt;
&gt; none of the RDF media types i have encountered have these affordances
&gt; built in; there is no universal way for servers to inform clients of
&gt; the valid/appropriate possibilities at any point in time. Clients must
&gt; have this information hard-coded instead.

So is your point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF
based media type?  Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do
so?

These affordances you've mentioned are either built on link+@rel which
is, at least to me, semantically indistinguishable from an RDF triple,
or they are media type specific, and therefore not "universal".  Even
the ones that seem particularly distinctive don't always mean what
they are specified to mean.

For example, if my automated user agent reads in an HTML page it does
*not* retrieve and embed image resources linked to by that page.
Neither do the accelerating proxies though which it passes, they just
retrieve and cache. Interestingly they do exactly the same thing with
the `a` tags in the HTML. For the proxies there is no distinction
between `img` and `a` tags except perhaps in prioritization.

Peter:

good to see your reply.

- omitting _properties_ of the message? not following you here. maybe an example you can point to would clear this up for me.
 
- seems you assume M2M here in several of your replies. is it your POV that RDF is only to be used in M2M scenarios? or do you mean to say that some of the affordances is describe have no value in M2M cases?

- IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine) affordance, i use "x:include" quite often in M2M cases

- templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, IME. as long as the vocab is stable and the templates are used to control timing and flow, this has worked well for me. of course H2M templates are much easier to support since the selector is not in the code, but in the head of the human.

finally:
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; So is your point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF
&gt; based media type? Â Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do
&gt; so?
&lt;/snip&gt;

i cited cases where people "bothered" to add affordances (i.e. Baker), made a value judgement on it's usefulness, and mentioned that they are not in production (that i can find). feel free to point out my blind spot there.

is it possible? not sure. my first attempts have not been good, but that's proly *me*&lt;g&gt;. 

is it *important*? not really. CSV doesn't provide affordances and it does quite well. my comment here is really about my particular experience. 

i am writing apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse, and (in some cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses. When i implement those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill; that's all.

now, i am quite ready to be shown a fool on this last point; to be given proof that i _can_ write clients that recognize hypermedia affordances in RDF-based media types. would be way cool.

<pre>Mike:

Check my understanding of the HAL design:

HAL offers just one hypermedia affordance: link navigation (or LO in the
H-Factor[1] list) with a @rel decorator(or CL in the H-factor list). The
value of the @rel provides the sole association with _all_ the semantic
details for the link (both protocol-level and domain-level).

The semantic details are spelled out in human-readable formz9in some
external Out-of-band document) and it is up to the developer to code this
human-readable information into the client before releasing the client
"into the wild". The response message contains no templates/forms, no
indications of transclusion, safety, or idempotency; that information is
always in the documentation alone.

For example, if the resource at the other end of the link allows one or
more optional arguments to be included, this is in documentation and not
indicated in the message. If the resource expects a DELETE or PUT to be
used along w/ a body, the details on determining which (DELETE or PUT is
used) is in the documentation. If there are required elements when sending
a body, it's in the documentation, and so forth.

Do I have this pretty much correct?

machine-readable at all the only real option is to hardcode those "rel"
values into the client. I could as well use a plain old JSON object property
whose value is the URI instead of having to put it into a special "_links"
property.

So, how is HAL e.g. different from using POX with Atom's link element?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Mike,

I think we should differentiate between the data (model?) layer and the
presentation layer in this discussion. The difference between LO and LE in
this instance really just matters if a human being is looking at a rendered
representation of the data (should the image be rendered or not?). Or do I
misunderstand you in this regard?

&gt; - omitting _properties_ of the message? not following you here. maybe
&gt; an example you can point to would clear this up for me.

I think what Peter meant here was that just as in, e.g., HTML you could
ommit certain RDF properties in the message if you don't want that a client
follows/knows those URIs. It's similar to removing an &lt;a&gt; from an HTML
representation if you wanna remove that state transition.

Simple example in pseudo-code

{
  "@type": "order",
  "@id": "/orders/13574",
  "total": 150.69,
  "payment": "/payment/49840"
}

If you would omit the payment property the client wouldn't be able to follow
that link, which is similar to omitting an

  &lt;a href="/payment/49840" rel="payment"&gt;Payment&lt;/a&gt;

from an HTML representation.


&gt; - seems you assume M2M here in several of your replies. is it your POV
&gt; that RDF is only to be used in M2M scenarios? or do you mean to say
&gt; that some of the affordances is describe have no value in M2M cases?

I don't know about Peter's POV but mine is that RDF has a great potential to
allow both, M2M and H2M, much better than, e.g., HTML where the link
relations are just described in a human readable fashion. We are far away
from that but since in RDF everything is machine processable a client could
"learn" (or maybe better infer) the meaning of new link relations based on
his already existing knowledge for instance.


&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine)
&gt; affordance, i use "x:include" quite often in M2M cases

Hmm... Could you elaborate a bit on this? Why don't you simply include it,
i.e., merge it into the response instead of just linking to it?


&gt; - templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, IME. as long as
&gt; the vocab is stable and the templates are used to control timing and
&gt; flow, this has worked well for me. of course H2M templates are much
&gt; easier to support since the selector is not in the code, but in the
&gt; head of the human.

Again, IMHO this is part of the presentational logic which is unimportant in
M2M scenarios. As long as a M2M client is able to understand the template's
variables and fill them with concrete values there isn't really any
difference to a form, right?


&gt; i am writing apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse, and
&gt; (in some cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses. When i
&gt; implement those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill; that's
&gt; all.

But you need to program those client apps to look for specific
links/forms/affordances, right? So why do you think this is any different?
The only difference I see is that instead of having just a human readable
documentation you make (parts of) it also machine-processable.

But I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary to describe
basic control flows - something I planned to work on rather sooner than
later.

while i used HTML in some examples, the idea of transclusion and
navigation are not limited to visual affordances. i cited x:include as
one example and could have using LINK, X:LINK, etc. in others. in an
M2M scenario i have in mind (a real life example, btw), a set of
machines make requests of a server in order to get "work" to complete
(in this case documents and/or images to process in various ways as
indicated by data returned by the servers). these bots recognize (in
one case) affordances that instruct the client to gather other data
from other locations in order to complete a single document that is to
be sent to the server for additional work. in another case, the client
recognizes affordances that instruct the client to go evaluate the
current state of the resource, select optimal values and submit them
to one or more servers for additional processing. and so forth.

in the example i offer here, the number and type of affordance varies
per request, the number of varible arguments (i.e. members of
templates/forms) can vary, too. in some cases idempotent requests are
appropriate, in others non-idempotent requests are the "correct"
choice. most of the requests are "safe", but some are not. this
information appears in the messages clients receive.

it's their job to recognize, parse, evaluate, and activate until
reaching a goal (usually that goal is "all works is done, thanks")

indicate variance in what selections clients have; what action they
can take. this _seems_ to be at odds w/ what peter indicated to me in
his reply.
&lt;snip&gt;We have the uniform interface so any method may be called on any
resource.&lt;/snip&gt;

let's steer clear of "meaning" and "learn" here. i am not making any
claims or requirements of this type.  what i have stated to this point
is that there are two types of _information_ i am interested in
including in messages sent from server to client: protocol-level
information and domain-specific information. I have given examples of
protocol-level information that i can include in message designs. i
have asserted that i am unable to clearly indicate that same level of
protocol information when using RDF-based media types. am i incorrect?

to be clear, i am not saying RDF-based media types MUST or SHOULD
carry that information, just that i have yet to see examples of this
level of information in RDF-based media type messages.

i also concede that you and Peter question whether the protocol-level
information i have identified is _needed_ in messages from servers.
Peter states:
"I am not sure why protocol method is important. "
and
"Why would a media type need to encode [idempotency] information?"

And you say:
"The difference between LO and LE ... just matters if a human being is

have i mis-quoted here or taken these out of context as to abuse their intent?

in the implementations i create, not all possible variables are
acceptable in call cases, even if all variables are _known_
beforehand. in my work clients look in the message to see which of the
client's known variables are valid for this instance and (in some

completing request bodies, URI templates, choices of one or more "next
steps" evaulated against a goal or other workflow of the client,
etc.).

the work i do right now is not a fixed set of  actions w/ static,
pre-defined parameters. knowing a set of static state transitions
ahead of time is insufficient for this work. instead clients need to
be prepared to respond to representations returned by the server.

&gt;
&gt; But I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary to describe

This all sounds good but why should it matter if it's a link or an embed if
it's not rendered to a human user? The client nevertheless has to understand
what to do with that specific resource in order to reach its goal - whether
it's LE or LO doesn't really matter IMO. Or am I wrong?

&gt; do you think i am mis-representing peter's reply here?

I think so. I think Peter was referring to HTTP methods which are uniform
and available on all resource. Nevertheless those methods might not be
supported and/or allowed for certain resources (at certain times).


&gt; let's steer clear of "meaning" and "learn" here. i am not making any
&gt; claims or requirements of this type.  what i have stated to this point

&gt; have asserted that i am unable to clearly indicate that same level of
&gt; protocol information when using RDF-based media types. am i incorrect?

That question here that arises for me is if you can really separate it that
way!? Protocol level information is in my opinion in most cases quite
tightly coupled to the domain-specific information, i.e., the application
domain. In HTML e.g. it's hypertext documents and there it surely makes
sense to have general hyperlinks and forms. In RDF you are talking about raw
data which is interlinked. Since the way of presenting this data is entirely
up to the client I doubt that a "form" is an adequate abstraction.


&gt; i also concede that you and Peter question whether the protocol-level
&gt; information i have identified is _needed_ in messages from servers.
&gt; Peter states:
&gt; "I am not sure why protocol method is important. "
&gt; and
&gt; "Why would a media type need to encode [idempotency] information?"
&gt; 
&gt; And you say:

&gt; and
&gt; "[templates are] part of the presentational logic which is unimportant
&gt; in M2M scenarios."

I don't question whether they are needed but whether it makes sense to
separate them from the domain specific information. A MIME type is
specifying a format for a more or less specific application domain. That
MIME type also specifies how the protocol-level information has to be
interpreted so I'm not sure if you can really separate them in the way you
propose (as I understand it). IOW for me both are at the same level of
abstraction.

I still don't really understand the difference. It is up to the domain
semantics what the client does. Whether the protocol-level information says
embed or link doesn't make any difference IMHO. But maybe you are more
thinking of splitting the semantics into two parts which are: embed (the
client *has* to follow this link) + process it according the remaining
domain semantics!?


&gt; in the implementations i create, not all possible variables are
&gt; acceptable in call cases, even if all variables are _known_

doesn't matter whether your client looks for a link with rel="payment" or a

Hmm.. honestly I can't come up with any scenario where the difference
matters. Let's take an example from the H Factor page [1]:

  LE: &lt;img src="http://www.example.org/images/logo" title="company logo" /&gt;

Would the following be any different from a M2M POV? Would it render some
functionality impossible?

  LO: &lt;a href="http://www.example.org/images/logo" title="company
logo"&gt;company logo&lt;/a&gt;

I don't think so. It's up to the client to look for a URI with an associated
title "company logo" and process the resource associated to the found URI
accordingly.

<pre>does your opinion hold the same:

- when the target resources are not binary as in the example you
supplied, but are instead text?
- when there are multiple transclusion links in the same representation?
- when the client's goal is to compare several resources and produce output?
- when the client's goal is to combine several resources and store the result?

Yes, that doesn't matter from the client's POV. It either has the required
codec to interpret the representation or not. According to you, what should
that change?


&gt; - when there are multiple transclusion links in the same
&gt; representation?

Yes


&gt; - when the client's goal is to compare several resources and produce
&gt; output?

Yes, because in both cases it has to dereference the resources and compare
the retrieved representations.


&gt; - when the client's goal is to combine several resources and store the
&gt; result?

This one might be a bit trickier because if you would really have LE which
is not dependent on a specific MIME-type you could generalize your client to
do just that task. But as far as I know, such a MIME type independent LE
doesn't exist and so again it is up to the client to understand the
semantics associated to that specific element in that specific MIME type to
proceed.
In HTML the LE as e.g. used in the &lt;img&gt; tag is necessary because the client
(browser) has a hardcoded knowledge of what an &lt;img&gt; is and how it should be
rendered.
Looking at the favicon it is not that clear weather that's LE or LO - or is
it? It would as well been possible to reuse the &lt;img&gt; tag in the header for
this. Instead a generic &lt;link&gt; was used and the information on how to
process it was moved into the "rel" attribute. Why was it done that way? IMO
to introduce without needing to change the MIME type, i.e., HTML in this
case. So the semantics in this case are out-of-band and not defined in the
MIME type and yet it works quite well in practice.

Sorry to intervene again, but isn't embedding/linking discussion mixing
presentation (user interface, rendering) level and domain objects semantic?

There is usually more than one way to render a domain object, regardless of
it being simple or composite.

&gt;   does your opinion hold the same:
&gt;
&gt; - when the target resources are not binary as in the example you
&gt; supplied, but are instead text?
&gt;
IMHO there is no any difference.

If the client shows only a link inside a text document, but on click
launches an AJAX call to retrieve the transcluded text and show it in
a collapsible widget, is it considered navigating or embedding?


&gt; - when there are multiple transclusion links in the same representation?
&gt;
It depends solely how the client would like process the links in the
representation, as in the AJAX scenario above. Of course it could be
extended beyond simple retrieval.


&gt; - when the client's goal is to compare several resources and produce
&gt; output?
&gt;
I would have a separate REST resource, solely dealing with comparison of
resources (and eventually making the result available under new URI).
   Perhaps with its own media type/ link rel.

&gt; - when the client's goal is to combine several resources and store the
&gt; result?
&gt;
&gt;
I would have a separate REST resource, generating the combination and
providing the result under a new URI.  Perhaps with its own media type/
link rel.

Just my 2 cents.

Best regards,
Nina

So you agree that transclusion can be determined by the relation type
(rel=stylesheet) rather than the hypermedia control itself (link)? And,
apart from the impracticalities, would you agree there is no reason that
all others transclusions could be changed to follow this approach, i.e.
&lt;link rel="image".. instead of &lt;img.. etc?

Is it deliberate that H Factors cannot distinguish between 'framed'
embedded state and client-fetched embedded state? I think it would be
useful to have separate H Factors which distinguish between the two,
because the former is a very common and valuable optimisation technique
(particularly in m2m scenarios).

<pre>Caching is an constraint of the web (derived from REST),  why is this
not a given?

Isn't one of the objectives of caching that there should be no need to
store a combined result, because caching provides a standard mechanism
which can prevent subsequent recombinations from having to hit the
network? i.e. they are stored - but in their constituent parts, as
responses from separate URIs.

&gt;&gt; transcluded resources. Or is that not what you mean here?

Yes, if it is guaranteed that dereferencing the "self" link of an embedded
resource (as in the HAL examples) returns exactly the same representation -
which usually isn't guaranteed. If just a subset is embedded it might still
be necessary to dereference to get all the data and then again it's just a
link.

Right, the embedded resources are effectively a form of link and
should be used that way by clients if the embedded representation is
not sufficient for their needs. HAL doesn't provide any  guarantee of
completeness for the same reason an HTTP response doesn't guarantee
anything about the target of Content-Location.

So you are agreeing here that 'framed' embedding is a form type of LE
that is distinct from LO, even in a m2m context?

In my experience it is a very common requirement to optimise
applications this way, which is why I put it into HAL.

Out of interest - is it possible to do this with RDFa? how would that work?

I'm not sure about this. You could also see that framed embedding as a form
of pagination which is in turn again LO in my opinion. So I'm still
struggling to see any form of LE. A link is a pointer to another resource
(or possibly also to the containing resource itself). You either have a
pointer to the data or directly the plain data.

Agree completely with that and that's one point where RESTful services
surely lack behind normal Web pages (think of image sprites).

Sure, you just include some triples of the other resource in the current
representation:

&lt;div xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" about="#me" rel="foaf:knows"&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li about="http://example/markus#me" typeof="foaf:Person"&gt;

href="http://example.com/bob"&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I posted it also here where it might be easier to read:

Nothing prevents you to lookup http://example/markus#me for more information
about that embedded resource.

It's quite similar (http://pastebin.com/f11Av1Jx), without using prefixes
you would end up with something like: 

{
  "@context": {
    "homepage": { "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type":
"@id" },
    "know": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
  },
  "@id": "#me",
  "know": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example/bob#me",
      "name": "Bob",
      "homepage": "http://example.com/bob"
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/#me",
      "name": "Markus",
      "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
    }
  ]
}

If you have multiple of these representations you might consider putting the
context in an external file and just reference it.

&gt;&gt; ok, let me ask you directly, can you imagine any circumstance where

&gt;
&gt; Hmm.. honestly I can't come up with any scenario where the difference
&gt; matters. Let's take an example from the H Factor page [1]:
&gt;
&gt;  LE: &lt;img src="http://www.example.org/images/logo" title="company logo" /&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Would the following be any different from a M2M POV? Would it render some
&gt; functionality impossible?
&gt;

The way I build hypermedia driven clients, it makes a huge difference
whether a link is an LE or an LO.  When I do an LO,  my client is
moving to a new state based on the response from the server.  Any
links that were previously available in the client's previous state
are potentially no longer valid.  However, if I do an LE I am simply
augmenting the clients current state with some additional information.

Consider the scenario where the user-agent is in a state where there
are two possible LO transitions rel="submit-order"
rel="change-quantity" and a LE rel="product-details".  If I request
the "product-details" then the client knows that both "submit-order"
and "change-quantity" are still valid.  However, if the client follows
"submit-order" and the returned response does not include a
rel="change-quantity" then it would be wise for the client not to
attempt to try and follow that link.

Agree, but IMO that is domain specific information and not protocol-level
information as per Mikes distinction.
The discussion was whether a media type needs the distinction of LE/LO at
the protocol level, i.e. &lt;img&gt; vs. &lt;a&gt;, or whether that is (solely) domain
specific information.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The way I see it is that there are only two ways of conveying semantics to
a client.  Link relations and media types.  HTTP is the only application
protocol I use.

Whether LE and LO are identified via domain specific rels or some specific
syntax as defined by the media type makes no difference to me.  The point
is that they are fundamentally different ways that hypermedia clients need
to process links.

You said in an earlier email...
"What is an "navigation experience" in an M2M scenario. If there is a link
all I can do is to dereference it (by whatever method I choose to use) a
process the retrieved representation or ignore it. This is independent of

From the perspective of a client that conforms to the hypermedia
constraint, I would disagree.  De-referencing a LO has a different effect
on the client state than de-referencing an LE.

&gt; good to see your reply.

I am very happy to have this conversation. I am having very similar
conversations at work, and i am trying to decide exactly what i think.

&gt; - omitting _properties_ of the message? not following you here. maybe an example you
&gt; can point to would clear this up for me.

Well, if a human goes to a web page in a browser we just omit any
links they are not allowed to execute (either because they are not
authorized, or because the state of the resource does not allow it). I
was suggesting that we might do the same thing with any other media
type.

&gt; - seems you assume M2M here in several of your replies. is it your POV that
&gt; RDF is only to be used in M2M scenarios? or do you mean to say that some of
&gt; the affordances is describe have no value in M2M cases?

I did not mean to imply that RDF would *only* be useful in the M2M
scenario. I do think RDF is more compelling for M2M use cases, though.
We already have a quite good media type for use cases that involve
real time user interaction (HTML). No need to reinvent to wheel for
those use cases. For automata use cases HTML is somewhat less
compelling.

As for affordances, I am not sure i see the same set of affordances
you do, or at least not in the same way. By analogy, in the physical
world some affordances are possible because of the laws of nature or
the evolution of the human body, other are based purely on cultural
convention (eg, up usually maps to forward). I think the "embed" link
affordance is based on a set of cultural conventions (img usually maps
to embed). However, which culture a client belongs to depends on what
it is trying to accomplish and what technology it uses. So different
clients might interprete the same feature as a different affordance.

&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine) affordance, i use
&gt; "x:include" quite often in M2M cases

I agree that automated user agent can make good use of transclusion.
However, i am inclined to think that the decision of whether to
transclude belongs to the client rather than the server. Proxies to
not transclude any representations in html, regardless of the flavor
of those links. Screen readers have no need to transclude images in
HTML. Nor do (most) automated user agents, for that matter.

Are these clients wrong/broken when they choose to treat a "embed"
link as a "navigation" link?

Under what circumstances would it be wrong/broken for an automated
client to transclude a "navigation" link if it could successfully
interpret the resulting document?

&gt; - templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, IME. as long as the vocab is
&gt; stable and the templates are used to control timing and flow, this has worked well
&gt; for me. of course H2M templates are much easier to support since the selector is
&gt; not in the code, but in the head of the human.

Agreed. There are situations where templates provide significant
value. (Eg, give me a list of thing created between two timestamps.)
However, that value is less overwhelming in M2M scenarios.

&gt; finally:
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt; So is your point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF
&gt;&gt; based media type?  Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do
&gt;&gt; so?
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; is it possible? not sure. my first attempts have not been good, but that's proly *me*&lt;g&gt;.

That is not promising. Though as you point out, not conclusive.

&gt; is it *important*? not really. CSV doesn't provide affordances and it does
&gt; quite well. my comment here is really about my particular experience.

Well, CSV does quite well as a data format. But not so well as a media
type on which to build complex distributed applications.

&gt; i am writing apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse,
&gt; and (in some cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses.
&gt; When i implement those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill;
&gt; that's all.

Fair enough. The rendering part does seem like it would be a bit
harder to handle with RDF. All the UI logic would have to be directly
coded into the client(s).

I get the impression that the problem with link relations types is that 
they are utilised for both domain-level semantics (these are 
relations/properties analogue to RDF properties in ontologies) and 
application/protocol-level semantics* (e.g., "edit", "submit-order", 
"change-quantity"). Where the former ones only have a descriptive 
purpose ("meaning"), the latter ones are actions for the control 
flow/application state (which are usually not part of RDF vocabularies 
now-a-days).
It might be better to differentiate them, e.g., via 'rel' (for 
domain-level semantics) and 'action-rel' (or simply 'action'; for 
application/protocol-level semantics). Of course, one could also 
describe them in a vocabulary.

The nice thing about the rel attribute is that you can provide multiple
values if you want.
&lt;link rel="foobar edit" href="..."/&gt;

If you want to distinguish between "domain" semantics and
"application/protocol" semantics, you can do that. :-)

I am not sure i buy the "domain" vs "application" vs "protocol"
distinction. I cannot think of a single feature of any media type that is
clearly a domain only feature with no protocol or application semantics, or
vice versa.

In every case it seems that the domain, application and protocol semantics
are deeply, and irrevocably, intertwined. Basically all semantics are
domain semantics. The domain of HTML is interactive (human) ui so it has
the capability to describe that sort of application and protocol.  The
domain of Atom is new feeds so it has the capability to describe that sort
of application and protocol.

Are there examples of media type features that have domain, application or
protocol only semantics that i have missed?

Yes, I know and I identified that as a fault/misconception ATM. It's 
like putting things together that shouldn't be put together. An action 
is not a relation (property, attribute, ...) in that sense.

A triple ï¿½ la
&lt;#bob&gt; ex:edit &lt;#edit-bob-resource&gt; it not common now-a-days, because it 
combines description-level semantics with application-level semantics. 
However, it would makes sense to define a new attribute, e.g., 
'action-rel', whose value could be "edit". "edit" could be identified 
via a URI, e.g., http://example.com/edit, which could be resolved to 
retrieve processing information, e.g., the (HTTP) method, e.g. or the 
accept/enc-type to process the referred/target resource. This processing 
information could be utilised by the hypermedia client.

The default action in that context could be "view" or "show".

We discussed on the #rest channel at freenode another example (I utilise 
your original statements in quotation marks) which includes an 
'transclusion link' (LE):

1.  "My client app loads a root resource from a service." - my client 
resolved a URI/L
2. "There are a set of available databases that are presented as links 
in the root resource." - these are 'navigation links' (LO)
3. "It's a multi-tenant type of app."
4. "One of the links in the root resource is to the user's preferences." 
- e.g. &lt;XYZ rel="user-profile" 
href="http://example.com/alice-user-profile" /&gt;; "user-profile" is a 
description-level relation
5. "The client does a LE on the preferences because inside the 
preferences, amongst other things is the "preferred" tenant that the 
user wishes to use."
6. "So to recap.  The client retrieves the root resource, then GETs  a 
LE link, determines the preferred tenant and then does a LO to get to 
the "shell" of the tenant."
7. " The difference to me is that the client did not "navigate" to the 
preferences end-point.  It merely retrieved that data and aggregated it 
into it's current state." - so the client executed an action, e.g. 
"retrieve-tenant" to retrieve that piece of information, e.g. &lt;XYZ 
rel="user-profile" action-rel="retrieve-tenant" 
href="http://example.com/alice-user-profile" /&gt;; as described above 
"retrieve-tenant" could be resolved to a processing description that 
includes e.g. a (SPARQL) query description to retrieve the preferred 
tenant of a user for his/her preferences.

RDF includes only "domain"/description-level semantics*. The tipping 
point is RDF itself is a knowledge representation structure/knowledge 
representation language and not a media type. However, RDF 
serialisation/representation formats are media types, e.g. Turtle or 
RDF/XML.


*) the crux is that since one could describe everything one could 
describe application-level semantics with RDF as well :)

=&gt; so it's really hard to draw a line

I think a good example is RDFa that could be integrated into other 
existing markup media types, e.g., XHTML+RDFa (see also  [1]). So one 
could integrate RDFa in, e.g., XAML as well (if needed).

&gt; i'll cry "uncle" here and cede the field to you.

Perhaps this thread of the discussion has gone past the point of
usefulness. I was, of course, pushing the argument a bit beyond what
seems reasonable to see if it would break. Unfortunately, i am not
sure if it did.


I would like to go back to a question i asked earlier, if you don't
mind, regarding the distinction between embed and navigation links.

You often speak of the affordances provided by media types. I am not
sure i see the same set of affordances you do, or at least not in the
same way. In the physical world some affordances are possible because
of the laws of nature or the evolution of the human body, other are
based purely on cultural convention (eg, up usually maps to forward).
I think the "embed" link affordance is based on a set of cultural
conventions (img usually maps to embed).

However, which culture a client belongs to depends on what it is
trying to accomplish and what technology it uses. So different clients
might interprete the same feature as a different affordance. Proxies
do not transclude any representations in html, regardless of the
flavor of those links. Screen readers have no need to transclude
images in HTML. Nor do (most) automated user agents, for that matter.
To those clients the `img` element affords navigation, not embedding.

Are these clients wrong/broken when they choose to treat a "embed"
link as a "navigation" link?

Under what circumstances would it be wrong/broken for a client to
transclude a "navigation" link if it could successfully interpret the
resulting document?

Here you begin mixing protocols and media types.

&gt; to a _media_type_ (i.e HTML, Atom, etc.) in which the semantics of both
the
&gt; problem domain and the target protocol are then _bound_ together.

I think that was what the discussion was about. It was about whether a media
type can contain problem domain independent support for LE and LO. My
argument was that this is impossible since the semantics of the problem
domain specify what a client does with the link target. You argue (at least
that's my understanding) that a media type is able to specify without any
specific problem domain semantics whether a link is LE or LO.


To answer Darrel's earlier question:

&gt;&gt; "What is an "navigation experience" in an M2M scenario. If there is a
link
&gt;&gt; all I can do is to dereference it (by whatever method I choose to use) a
&gt;&gt; process the retrieved representation or ignore it. This is independent of
&gt;&gt; whether it is LE or LO according to your classification. Do you
disagree?"
&gt;&gt;
&gt; From the perspective of a client that conforms to the hypermedia
constraint,
&gt; I would disagree.  De-referencing a LO has a different effect on the
client
&gt; state than de-referencing an LE.

I agree, but that entirely depends upon the client. The server should not
even know what the client is doing. Putting that information on the server
side doesn't make any sense to me.

Imagine a client whose task it is to retrieve the first embedded image in a
given Web page. I think you would agree that even though the server
specifies it as &lt;img&gt;, i.e., LE the client state would be changed to
"success" after retrieving that image. Or do you disagree with that?

So my argument was that it is impossible to specify on the server side
whether a link is LE or LO because it is entirely up to the client to do
decide how the link is interpreted. All the server can do is to describe the
"meaning" respectively the relation of the link to the current
representation.

I think there are some interpretation problems with LE and LO. When we 
discussed this issue yesterday at the #rest channel at freenode (see 
[1]), I came up with some definitions that made sense for some of the 
channel members (at least ;) ):

1. a "navigation link" (LO) can be interpreted as "push application into 
a next state", e.g. "submit-order"
2. an "embedded link" (LE) can be interpreted as "deliver information to 
be able to push application into a next state", this could maybe also 
"include"

=&gt; I would especially vote for renaming LE to "transclusion link"

In hypermedia media types the link type/intent could be derived from the 
surrounding tag (+ further attribute values of that tag (instance)) that 
includes a target resource as a value of a attribute.

 From a data-only perspective we do not need to differentiate link 
types. However, it is useful to do this in a hypermedia environment to 
specify it's intended purpose (i.e. in this context it doesn't matter 
how a caching server processes this link, because this is not the place 
where the application state would/could be changed).

Bo

I think the server has every right to suggest to the client how it expects
a link to be processed.  And the client has every right to ignore that
advice at it's own risk.

For me, one of the benefits of REST has been the ability to  move logic to
the server that previously had to be done on the client.  This makes my
client much thinner and dumber :-)  Which is a good thing for me because it
facilitates independent evolution.

I think the difference of perspective comes from the fact that some people
are trying to put data on the web that smart clients are going to consume
for unknown purposes.  I'm not, I'm trying to make an application available
on the web.  I want to expose a bunch of knobs and levers and switches that
user-agents can manipulate to "get stuff done".

Regarding your specific question about the status of a client after a LE
request.  It is up to the client what to do about the status of LE
requests.  I see the client status as the aggregate of an LO and subsequent
LE requests.  A client may decide to ignore some failed LE requests, like a
browser does if it can't return an image.  Some LE requests may be
considered critical.  The link relation would need to specify that, IMHO.

It sounds as if your POV is that the state the client moves to (the next application state) is somehow known/understood by the server so that the server would know anything about transitions being valid or not. IOW, that the server would know anything about the clients application.

Am I reading that correctly?

I'd reply that the application is entirely a concern of the client. The question of whether a link that the client has seen at some point in time can be used to construct some successful future request (with the goal of satisfying some intent) is not part of any application semantics.

In addition I'd reply that the application state is not comprised of only the response to the previous request but of *all* responses to previous requests that the client (on 'behalf' of the application being executed) was instructed to keep track of. If the application is to search trough a number of online stores to find a certain book and if I keep open 20 windows in my browser, each displaying a response, then the application state is comprised of all those open windows.

Makes sense?

&gt; However, if I do an LE I am simply
&gt; augmenting the clients current state with some additional information.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the scenario where the user-agent is in a state where there
&gt; are two possible LO transitions rel="submit-order"
&gt; rel="change-quantity" and a LE rel="product-details". If I request
&gt; the "product-details" then the client knows that both "submit-order"
&gt; and "change-quantity" are still valid. However, if the client follows
&gt; "submit-order" and the returned response does not include a
&gt; rel="change-quantity" then it would be wise for the client not to
&gt; attempt to try and follow that link.

&gt;

The state that the client moves to when following a LO is provided by
the server.  So yes, for a brief moment of time the server knows a
significant amount of information about the state the client is moving
to.  I say for a brief moment, because that returned representation
may be created based on information provided in the request that the
server does not hold onto.
The server does not know everything about the client state because,
the client may have accumulated other state during its travels.

&gt; I'd reply that the application is entirely a concern of the client. The question of whether a link that the client has seen at some point in time can be used to construct some successful future request (with the goal of satisfying some intent) is not part of any application semantics.
&gt;
You are correct in that the client has every right to go and dig up an
old link and try and re-use it.  However, it is also in the best
interests of the client to use the information provided to it by the
server to make the smartest decisions.  If a server returns a
representation that does not contain a link that was previously
available,  then it would probably be wise not to present it as an
option to the human.  I tend to use link relations as a way of hinting
to clients which links are safe to hold onto and which ones are not.

&gt; In addition I'd reply that the application state is not comprised of only the response to the previous request but of *all* responses to previous requests that the client (on 'behalf' of the application being executed) was instructed to keep track of. If the application is to search trough a number of online stores to find a certain book and if I keep open 20 windows in my browser, each displaying a response, then the application state is comprised of all those open windows.
&gt;

I would agree that application state can be viewed as an aggregate of
numerous different interactions.  I model that within my client as a
set of independent "agents".  Each open window would have it's own
agent and every agent has the state of the last LO response and and
subsequent LE requests from that LO response.

&gt; Makes sense?
&gt;
It does, but I'm not seeing any contradictions in our opinions.  The
only difference I see is that I tend to view the client as a slave of
the servers it interacts with and other people seem to see it the
other way around.

Ah, yes - that is a interesting way to express that. Good.

&gt; I tend to use link relations as a way of hinting
&gt; to clients which links are safe to hold onto and which ones are not.

To me, this is the topic of 'bookmarkability' - how does the client know what links are good to hold on to and which are the ones that are not. Open for research, IMHO. You seem to think it goes (to some extend) into the link semantics spec, yes? I think that, too.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In addition I'd reply that the application state is not comprised of only the response to the previous request but of *all* responses to previous requests that the client (on 'behalf' of the application being executed) was instructed to keep track of.

Ah, ok. I tend to think one agent having many last responses (open windows). Also interesting to compare the two views.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Makes sense?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; It does, but I'm not seeing any contradictions in our opinions. 

No, did not mean that. I just wanted to make sure you do not think anything which I'd completely disagree with - otherwise I would get confused, and all :-)

&gt; The
&gt; only difference I see is that I tend to view the client as a slave of
&gt; the servers it interacts with and other people seem to see it the
&gt; other way around.

Ah, right. I view the client as just using the servers as it sees fit (given its own intended application). OTH, if you define a media type you necessarily are guided by some perceived 'canonical application' to be achieved with that type (e.g. create and edit blog entries in the case of AtomPub). And necessarily this constrains the stuff that the client can do with that media type quite a bit. And also does the server offer the client hypermedia controls (e.g. links) that the server things make sense for the client. So the client is also a slave to the server in what *can* actually happen.

Thanks for clarifying.

That probably explains why i have had such a hard time grokking the

So there's no difference for you between navigational links to other
resources that require an additional request, and 'embedded' resource state
that is presented within the representation so that an additional request
is potentially unnecessary?

That is not what i meant. Clearly there is a difference between
embedding a representation of one resource inside the representation
of another and one representation providing a link to another
resource.

The distinction i have a hard time seeing is the abstract difference
between an `img` and an `link` element (or xinclude vs xlink).
Certainly some clients -- for example browsers -- treat those link
flavors very differently, but to me that seems like an implementation
detail of the client. Others seem to view the distinction as more
important.

Ok. fwiw, that also falls under 'embed link' in mike's H Factors -
hence the question.

wrt HTML's img tag - it's explicit about the embed semantics:

"The IMG element embeds an image in the current document at the
location of the element's definition. The IMG element has no content;
it is usually replaced inline by the image designated by the src
attribute.."

True, and yet many clients completely ignore that bit of the spec and

The way i read that post, message type is a way for the client to
inform the server how it has decided to use a particular link. Not a
way for the server to tell the client how it should use a particular
link. Ie, it would be ok for a client to dereference a `img` tag link
as an active request (or any other valid value, for that matter).

Is it fair to say that any media type that supports exposing links

&gt; 
&gt; Is it fair to say that any media type that supports exposing links

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to create a list of formats with native hypermedia support
&gt; (HTTP)
&gt; that goes beyond just links supporting a GET.. So far my list is quite
&gt; short
&gt; and I can't believe that that's all:
&gt; 
&gt; - HTML (GET/POST/PUT)
&gt; - Atom &amp; AtomPub (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
&gt; - WSDL (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
&gt; - WADL (GET/POST/PUT/HEAD/DELETE)
&gt; - Collection+JSON (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure I missed a lot. Do you know of any other formats?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

so much grey area.. e.g. you have included Atom which effectively

Fwiw, I usually analyse media types using mamund's H Factors, or a set
of terminology very similar to it. Are they not sufficient for your
case?

It is worth noting that some of us do not believe that the LO vs LE
distinction is an important one at the media type level. It seems to
me purely a request time distinction.

Which list was wrong in your opinion? Currently I have the following two:

Native hypermedia support beyond GET:
- HTML (GET/POST/PUT)
- Atom+AtomPub (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- WSDL (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- WADL (GET/POST/PUT/HEAD/DELETE)
- Collection+JSON (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- CCXML (GET/POST) - thanks to Erlend
- Shoji (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) - thanks to Robert

Allow "semantic" annotation of links which can be used to support other
methods
- HTML
- Atom+AtomPub
- HAL
- RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, ...
- JSON-LD
- WADL/WSDL??

I don't think any media type provides exactly those semantics. What
they provide is higher level application level semantics, eg "the
resource at this uri is an image that the user will often want to see
embedded in the document". However, clients are *not* obliged to treat
that link as embedded. A client might fetch that resource
automatically and embed it (gui browsers), they might fetch that
resource automatically and not embed it (caching proxies), they might
render it as a clickable link (a text based browser), or they might
just ignore it entirely (most automated user agents).

Clients have exactly the same set of choices for what to do with a
link regardless of whether it is an `&lt;link&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;` or `&lt;a&gt;` tag.
They consider the application semantics of the link for their use case
and decide whether to treat linked resources a something to embed or
not.

I don't think RDF serializations are any different. Clients consider
the semantics of the relationships of the links for their use case and
decide whether or not to embed the linked resources.

First, i agree.

Second, in the converse, can you tell me what it is that appears in a
media type message design that clients *are* obliged to do (or, to use
your phrase "obliged to treat as...", etc.)?

Finally, the work i did on H-Factors was not meant as a set of
"obligations" for either client or server.

I was not talking about LE or LO. I was talking about HTTP methods. AtomPub,
e.g., clearly specifies that how member URIs with a link relation of "edit"
should be used. 

"The Member URI allows clients to retrieve, edit, and delete a Member
Resource using HTTP's GET, PUT, and DELETE methods."

"A Member Entry SHOULD contain such an atom:link element with a link
relation of "edit", which indicates the Member URI."


&gt; Clients have exactly the same set of choices for what to do with a
&gt; link regardless of whether it is an `&lt;link&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;` or `&lt;a&gt;` tag.
&gt; They consider the application semantics of the link for their use case
&gt; and decide whether to treat linked resources a something to embed or
&gt; not.

Would you say the same is true for form@method="get" and form@method="post"?
I don't think any client out there will issue a GET when a POST is defined
or the other way round.. The same applies for a a@rel="edit" link in an Atom
document.

The issue you described above is another aspect which is irrelevant in this
context.


&gt; I don't think RDF serializations are any different. Clients consider
&gt; the semantics of the relationships of the links for their use case and
&gt; decide whether or not to embed the linked resources.

... but RDF doesn't describe any of them - in contrast to Atom's "edit"
relation e.g.

I don't think (m)any clients would try to get the resource from a POST
form.  However, they are welcome to if they want. That is part of the
uniform interface. Every resource responses to every method.

A client is also allowed to GET every permutation of a get form
without any user input, not that it is usually a good idea.

LE is not merely controls that initiate client transclusion - it also
includes control elements that are capable of marking out parts of the
content that represent other resources. iirc, you did agree this part of LE
is distinct from LO.

i appreciate your reply.

so, we both agree that the H-Factors are not to be interpreted as
"obligations." we also both agree that we cannot think of anything
that appears within a media type design that should be interpreted as
an obligation.

so, my next question is to ask, using HTML as an _example_ (since
there are other media type designs that provide the same types of
elements):

"how would *you* then describe, characterize, etc. the elements
HTML.IMG and HTML.A and how would *you* differentiate the two?

for example, in identifying H-Factors, i choose to characterize them
both as "link" elements. i choose to differentiate them based on the
"shared understanding" (as defined in the HTML spec) that one
indicates a transclusion and the other indicates a navigation.

note that the criteria i have adopted here are not tied to any
architectural style (i.e. REST, RPC, EBI, etc.). instead, i am
characterizing these elements based on what they *afford* the
recipient of the representation. note also, i am not placing a *value*
or *correctness* assessment on these affordances (i.e. "transclusion
is only valid in use case X" or "there is no need for anything other
than navigation links in all use cases", etc.).

I would just say they are both links. They do have different document
layout semantics that are useful for visually presenting HTML encoded
documents. That does not imply to me that i should expect/look for
similar semantics in media types for other domains.

&gt; for example, in identifying H-Factors, i choose to characterize them
&gt; both as "link" elements. i choose to differentiate them based on the
&gt; "shared understanding" (as defined in the HTML spec) that one
&gt; indicates a transclusion and the other indicates a navigation.

To my mind that shared understanding is domain specific, rather than
an affordance that would necessarily be available in any other
context. Fundamentally, HTML provides a way to describe (graphical)
user interfaces. In that context there is a significant difference
between transclusion and navigation. In other visually oriented
domains i would also expect a significant differences between
transclusion and linking out. However, i find the distinction less
compelling once you move to describing domains (read: media types)
that are less visually oriented.

By analogy, i think categorizing media types by whether they have LE
affordances is a bit like categorizing all physical objects by whether
they have a feature that affords pulling. In some contexts (doors)
such a categorization can be useful, in others it is clearly not. So
while you certainly could ask the question "does this object have a
feature that affords pulling" for any physical object it is probably
not a very important way to segment the set of all physical objects.

Asking that question has negative impacts, though. It encourages
people to unnecessarily put pull handles on the sides of houses just
so they can check that box. It make some wonder if they have missed
something really important because the desk they just designed doesn't
have pull handle. It also causes them to get into long mailing list
discussions about whether the hitch on their trailer counts as pull
handle or not. ;)

You list LE as one of the hypermedia factors. That implied to me that
you look for it (even if you don't necessarily expect it) in other
media types.

Until this conversation i was under the, apparently false, assumption
that the h-factors list was a collect them all sort of thing. The more
h-factors a media type has the better it is. The first line of the
page certainly seems to imply this, "The H Factor of a media-type is a
measurement of the level of hypermedia support and sophistication of a
media-type."

&gt; so is this whole discussion about you telling me i have my "scoping" wrong?

I don't know, maybe. It is hard for me to tell for sure. Maybe i am
missing something really fundamental.

&gt;&gt; that are less visually oriented.

&gt; so, you think transclusion is only "compelling" if the output is visual, right?

I do find embedding graphical elements in documents and user
interfaces (certainly a form a transclusion) compelling. However,
there are many other contexts in which various forms of transclusion
are useful (and therefore compelling. I used the embedded image
example because we have been using HTML as an example.

&gt; and "compelling" is your term for measure?

Not exactly. A measure of hypermedia capability is compelling to me if
i think it would be reasonable and useful to ask the question of any
media type, regardless of domain.  For example, i find LT to be an
extremely compelling measure to consider when evaluating, comparing
and designing media types.

I think my concern comes down to the fact that i just don't see the
similarity between `&lt;img src="..."/&gt;` and `&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
href="..."&gt;` (i assume this is considered an LE link) other than they
are often dereferenced automatically.

Hmm... does LE mean "the media type contains a flavor of link which
will be automatically dereferenced by the canonical consumer"?

ok, yes. i *do* find them in other designs and _use_ them in my own
new designs. i guess i got hung up on "should" and "expect" in a way
you didn't mean. sure, these appear other places (transclusion,
navigation, URI templating, payload templating, non/idempotent
requests, protocol method selection, request header manipulation,
tokenizing of link actions, etc. while HTML offers common examples of
most of all of these, Atom, VoiceXML, URI-List, HAL, Collection-JSON,
etc. all show examples, too.

yep, that text about "sophisitication" is pretty weak, eh? i wrote it
early in my experiments and should really update the page, relegate
some text to archives, etc.

the list i present there is not meant to be definitive (all
inclusive). i'm open to new ideas on how to improve it; both at the
membership and the narrative levels. and the idea was definitely *not*
to create a hierarchy with which to judge designs. just as creating a
set of constraints (color, materials, processing) for any industrial
design can add structure and cohesion, the factor model was meant as
an aide in design and analysis, not as a measure of judgement.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; so is this whole discussion about you telling me i have my "scoping" wrong?
&gt;
&gt; I don't know, maybe. It is hard for me to tell for sure. Maybe i am

well, i suspect the two of us are not yet on the same wave-length for
general terms. the last few posts have helped to teach me more about
your POV and i suspect it will take more typing still, that's all.

yeah, my point here is that compelling or not, these things exist. i
have decided to *not* attempt to say one or more of these things
SHOULD or MUST only be used in certain cases (visual rendering only,
etc.). i have treated all the factors this way. for example, i do not
say HTML is inferior because it does not offer support for idempotent
actions. i do not say that Atom is flawed because it offers no native
affordance for templated queries, etc. so "compelling" didn't enter
into my decision on what is included in the H-Factor list.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; and "compelling" is your term for measure?
&gt;
&gt; Not exactly. A measure of hypermedia capability is compelling to me if
&gt; i think it would be reasonable and useful to ask the question of any
&gt; media type, regardless of domain.  For example, i find LT to be an
&gt; extremely compelling measure to consider when evaluating, comparing
&gt; and designing media types.

compelling -&gt; reasonable -&gt; useful  it's good stuff, but not the kind
of measures i used when creating the list.

sure, you can create a media type design that uses _all_ these, just
one of these, etc. you can even create a really _ugly_, _unhelpful_
design with them!  my point is to document what's here and talk about
how they are used today.

so, yes, talking about how useful -&gt; reasonable, etc. some of the
affordances are in some cases at some period of time for some apps,
etc. is great. that switches from talking about whether an item ought
to be on my H-Factor *list* to whether an item on my H-Factor list
ought to be in a particular *design*; very worthwhile stuff. and much
of that talk will use words like "compelling", "useful",
"appriopriate", "successful', etc. because that's how design
implementations are evaluated.

but if the talk is to be about whether an item should be on the
H-Factor list at all, then i think the way we talk about these
affordances is different; the measures are different, the
examples/evidence are different. do transclusion affordances exists in
some designs? if so, should this affordance be included in the list of
possible factors? if yes, why; if not, why?, etc.

&gt; Hmm... does LE mean "the media type contains a flavor of link which
&gt; will be automatically dereferenced by the canonical consumer"?

that's an interesting observation. i have not included details on
_how_ these affordances must be treated by clients; only that they
appear and have a shared understanding between client and server.
immediate, deferred, pre-fetched, etc. are not included in my
affordance criteria right now and i do not know of any media type
documentation that defines in-message affordances as having these
constraints.

The difference is that the media type specifies the semantics. Whereas in
RDF the user specifies the semantics. You won't find them in the media type
specification of RDF/XML, Turtle, etc. The subject of this thread is
"formats with native hypermedia support going beyond GET".


&gt; &gt; Would you say the same is true for form@method="get" and
&gt; form@method="post"?
&gt; &gt; I don't think any client out there will issue a GET when a POST is

True, but it gives the server a way to show the client how to navigate
through his resource space. Sure, that's also possible with RDF and the like
but the semantics are shifted from the media type to the ontology.

My point here is that some ways of categorizing are more useful than
others. I see "embedded" vs "navigation" distinction as less useful.
(And largely completely indistinguishable in m2m scenarios.)

I think my strong reaction was partly due to an misunderstanding of
what you mean by LE and how you use the h-factors technique. If
h-factors were usually treated as a set of categorizations any of
which might or might not be useful in the situation at hand (which i
am beginning to infer is how you use them) then i would have no
concerns. However, most of the discussions involving the h-factors of

Ah, i see your point now. So a media type that was defined as "data
encoded in the foo vocabulary and serialized as json-ld" could,
depending on the properties defined in the vocabulary, pass muster on
this front?

Why aren't all RDF properties (whose values are a resource) equivalent
to `&lt;a&gt;` tags but where the media type is saying that any method is
ok?

Ouch!

&gt; My point here is that some ways of categorizing are more useful than

&gt; (And largely completely indistinguishable in m2m scenarios.)
&gt;
&gt; I think my strong reaction was partly due to an misunderstanding of
&gt; what you mean by LE and how you use the h-factors technique. If
&gt; h-factors were usually treated as a set of categorizations any of
&gt; which might or might not be useful in the situation at hand (which i
&gt; am beginning to infer is how you use them) then i would have no
&gt; concerns. However, most of the discussions involving the h-factors of
&gt; media types do *not* have that flavor to me.

hopefully your perception of my intent is a bit clearer now, possibly a bit more positive, too (if i'm lucky).

Even &lt;a&gt; tags in HTML don't disallow other methods than GET. The point is
that there's no way to define, e.g., the query parameters or the expected
body of a POST/PUT whereas HTML natively supports to describe such aspects
with forms. In RDF, that knowledge, again, has to be documented somewhere
out of band - possibly in an ontology.

So, coming back to my original question, does anyone knows other media types
which natively support hypermedia that goes beyond a simple GET?

The current list is:
- HTML (GET/POST/PUT)
- Atom+AtomPub (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- WSDL (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- WADL (GET/POST/PUT/HEAD/DELETE)
- Collection+JSON (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- CCXML (GET/POST) - thanks to Erlend
- Shoji (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) - thanks to Robert


I have another list of media types with built-in support for a "semantic"
annotation of links (which can be used to support other methods by
describing the details out-of-band):
- HTML
- Atom+AtomPub
- HAL
- RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, JSON-LD, ...
- WADL/WSDL??

Don't forget that method in hypertext, is also a function of URI.  I
wish this list was easier to search, I know I re-wrote the HTML 4.01
text concerning form methods and posted it here as an example, once.
Instead of HTTP methods, HTML should use tokens descriptive of sender
intent.  Because if the URI is mailto: the method won't be POST, will
it?  Even though that's what it says in the markup?

I'd rather see protocol-agnostic markup rather than bindings to specific
protocols, regardless of media type...

<pre>Idempotent operations are good for various reasons - for instance to avoid multiple creation of the same resource in the face of network errors. But how is it actually done in practice? What are your "tricks of the trade"?

Most implementations I have seen requires the client to create some kind of GUID and use that in a PUT operation. For instance in order to create a new "person" resource:

  PUT /person/{person-guid} HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: ...

  ... user data ...

If it fails then the client can retry the PUT operation to the same URL. The server must then keep track of succeeded "person-guids" (is there any "best practice" for how this is done?).

<pre>Hello Jørn,

I think this is even not REST specific. It´s a common problem in distributed systems theory. Basically you can use message-ids (equivalent to your example) or use some ACK (acknowledge) technique / protocol (i think there is something like POE post once exactly).

I think the pattern you described is slighty different: You POST your request to some factory resource with a guid. It will return you the adress, where you can PUT the person resource. If i remember correctly... :-)

Ah, sounds better, it frees the client from creating an ID/URL. But, thinking about it, I guess it should be:

"You GET a URL from a factory resource and then you POST/PUT your person as many times you want to that resource - only the first successful POST/PUT has an effect.".

Better re-read my REST cookbook.

This is only a useful option if you want to give the client control over the parts of the URI space (client determines GUID and hence chooses how the URI will look).

I'd use POST for creation because it gives more control to the server (over its own URI space).

Regarding idempotency, you have two options: 

- let the client provide a unique request ID, as outlined in the first half of http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html
- let the server provide a use-once-only POST accepting resource as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nottingham-http-poe/

HTH,

<pre>Hi all,
     I have a presentation coming up and want to make the case for the shift in the enterprise from WS-* to REST. Points on my slide are:
	* Google SOAP Search API deprecated in 2006
	* Amazon SOAP API deprecated in 2011
	* www.programmableweb.com (last 60 days: 115 SOAP APIs registered versus 290 REST API's)
	* InformationWeek survey (2009) where SOA implementation trend was towards REST from SOAP (http://www.informationweek.com/news/214501922)
Are there other references (bear in mind that I am in an academic arena and need quality references). Is there a more recent report/survey than the 2009 one above?

Another minor data point:

The latest version of Atlassian JIRA deprecates their SOAP API in
deference to their REST API.

Yup.

The question you're not asking is whether you want to re-engineer your
enterprise to the REST architecture. Does it really offer you any value.

SOAP -&gt; REST is not a drag and drop operation. It's a philosophical sea
change in design, planning, and operations.

How many of your interfaces are being used by external clients? What issues
are you having with the SOAP toolkits that you are using now?

Are you willing to give up the automation of the modern SOAP toolkits in
order to "hand craft" the payloads simply to stuff them over hand made HTTP
connection? Or are you willing to write your own tooling?

Do you have enough client and a long enough projection of services to
actually warrant re-engineering your system to the REST architecture? If
after N months of rework, where you get back to "where you started", do
perceived benefits warrant the N months stalling of work to reimplement
already deployed and operating systems. Or what kind of impedance mis-match
do you envision working in a mixed REST and SOAP world.

All sorts of issues in converting to REST. Better to create a stand alone
edge system (assuming REST is appropriate for it), perhaps, and have it
integrate with the existing back end.

Subject:RESTful Reference Collections and Queues?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The API I'm building seems to need several types of collections and I
think I've identified at least 3:

1) Collections of all the resource of a type (for example all the
users) where new resource can be created, destroyed and updated. This
seems to be the canonical RESTful collection where POST to the
collection URI creates the new resource and then PUT and DELETE to the
resource URI updates and destroys it.

2) Collections that represent relationships between resources (for
example the friends of a user). New relationships between resources
can be created with POST, but it's not clear how they should be
removed as the target resource should still exist, just no longer be
referenced.

3) Collections that represent queues of references (for example a TODO
list for a user). This is more complicated as the collection is
ordered and so elements in arbitrary positions need to be added or
removed and again the target resources should not be deleted.

If anyone could point me to nice patterns for implementing 2 and 3 I'd
be very grateful.

Cheers,

Jim

You can model both with PUT, where an omission/change-of-order by the
client implies the relationships have been removed/altered.

It's also possible to model the membership as a resource in its own right,
which presents something to clients which they can DELETE. Representing
this is easy if you have a quality hypermedia type e.g: here's how you
could represent a person and their friendships using application/hal+xml :

&gt; GET /person/bob

&lt; 200 OK
&lt; Content-Type: application/hal+xml
&lt; ....

&lt;resource href="/person/bob"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Bob&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;age&gt;40&lt;/age&gt;
  &lt;resource rel="friendship" href="/person/bob/friendship/23675"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="person" href="/person/dave" /&gt;
  &lt;/resource&gt;
  &lt;resource rel="friendship" href="/person/bob/friendship/87612"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="person" href="/person/jane" /&gt;
  &lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/resource&gt;

With the above clients now have the URI where they can DELETE (or update)
friendships individually as required.

Mike

In both cases it would be nice to request changes to the collections,
rather than PUTing potentially large collections for each change.

&gt; It's also possible to model the membership as a resource in its own right,

This seems like a clean way to model it, but somewhat heavyweight and
would seems llike it would require a request per deletion or
modification. In the case of the queue example, presumably the
position in the queue would be a property of the relationship
resource?

It would be nice to be able to delete, add or update ranges in the
collections in a single request, but I can't see how to do this via
the uniform interface in a clean way.

You could use the PATCH method for it but you would have to define a media
type which describes the exact PATCH semantics. Of course you also always
fall back to the catch-all method POST. Since POST has no inherent semantics
you will not violate any of REST's constraints. But also there you should
define a media type documenting how to interpret such a request.

Sure, or the positions could be determined by the order in which the

Subject:REST vs SOAP services evolvability<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello folks, this is my first post in rest-discuss, so please bear with me.

I get the benefits of changing link uris, but that's really not what this
post is about.

What I mean by evolvability is adding new features to a service or
modifying (when possible) existing ones and that's actually it.

SOAP isn't that bad as REST community tends to talk about it when it comes
to evolvability. For example:

   1. In REST we can add new rel - in SOAP we can add new method. Both
   types of old clients will continue working with new services.
   2. In REST we can add new form field and set its default value - in SOAP
   we could have service arguments as some ServiceArgs class and add a new
   field to ServiceArgs. That's ugly, but it works.


What are the evolvability examples when SOAP clients break and you can do
nothing about it, while REST clients are handling the situation gracefully?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,
This brings to memory an article I read some time ago, that explained how a
sequence of several idempotent operations could be made roughly equivalent
to a relational database transaction.

In Eric's article Creating Resources with
GET/PUT&lt;http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2011/11/creating-resources-with-get-put.html&gt;
 it
is explained how to PUT using a nonce supplied by the server it a way so
that the new resource is PUT only once.

Performing a GET pointing to the newly created resource would close the
"transaction", if it returns the right values. Then the UI could tell the
user that the operation she intended ended happily.

Subject:What does a form tell my program?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>There was a discussion here some weeks ago about the use of forms in REST services. Since then I have been wondering about how much such a form tells my program at *runtime*.

For this discussion I am focusing on HTML forms as we know them from the web. These includes:

- Action URL
- Encoding
- Operation
- Inputs

At runtime my program can parse the action URL, the encoding and the operation, and use these to dynamically create a HTTP request.

But what about the input definitions (the actual payload)? Are they useful at runtime? 

At compile-time (or "read the documentation time") the inputs are useful for telling my program (the developer) which values to that corresponds to what. As the developer I can see that the name of the person must be sent as "PersonName=xxx". But after this I don't see how the client program can use the input definitions for anything at runtime.

Have I overlooked some nice features of using forms?

One could decide to publish the identifiers for the input elements that is used. For instance saying that the input marked with id="name-of-person" defines the name of the input for the person's name. Like this:

  &lt;input id="name-of-person" name="PersonName"/&gt;

But I don't see how that really changes anything - its just one more indirection to follow.

to start:

what is it that you see about inputs that is different than
"operations", "encoding", and "action URL" that renders them (inputs)
useless only at runtime?

and what is it about those other things (ops, encoding, URL) that
remains "useful' at runtime?

&gt; In both cases it would be nice to request changes to the collections,
&gt; rather than PUTing potentially large collections for each change.
&gt;

PUTting large collection-like resources works less well with concurrent
edits though. With even just a few concurrent editors your clients would
have to keep refreshing and merging changes and retrying.  If you go with
the one-resource-per-entry, then (if the server is careful not to expose
offsets in the collection in the URIs) two (or many) clients can
simultaneously modify a list without conflicts.

This way of working also allows clients to work on an outdated copy of a
collection, which helps in perceived performance, since clients don't need
to refresh the collection all the time...

This seems like a clean way to model it, but somewhat heavyweight and
&gt; would seems llike it would require a request per deletion or
&gt; modification. In the case of the queue example, presumably the
&gt; position in the queue would be a property of the relationship
&gt; resource?
&gt;

+1. The "heavyweightness" is one of the tradeoffs of using REST. REST
doesn't have performance as its main goal, and trades efficiency for other
properties: "The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades
efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form rather
than one which is specific to an application's needs." — Fielding, 5.1.5

You must remember, though that the DELETE and 204 response would usually
both fit nicely within one TCP/IP packet.


&gt; It would be nice to be able to delete, add or update ranges in the
&gt; collections in a single request, but I can't see how to do this via
&gt; the uniform interface in a clean way.
&gt;
&gt;
Within the confines of the uniform interface, I would go with a GET or POST
and link to that resource, maybe using a form-like construct which tells
the clients e.g. two URIs which make a range of documents.

Client could GET a list of items (possibly a subset of the full list),
recognise a way of operating on a subset, and act on this.  This "way of
operating on a subset" could be a link relation which ends up in an
OpenSearch description where the client could search for items to operate
on, or simply a form where the client must fill out two URIs indicating the
range, and maybe some operation.

value ranges, default values, and hidden/disabled controls, all of them based on the context of the request. if you do this right, clients have to deal with a smaller set of options and have to make only the decisions that actually matter for their context.

Subject:Fwd: What does a form tell my program?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jorn:

Erik's list is a good start:
- supply defaults
- provide a range (select)
- indicate whether to show to a human (hidden)
- indicate mutability (disabled inputs cannot be changed)

Also, HTML5 offers  very long list of other attributes with which
servers can use to communicate to the client input qualities value[1]

Certainly the mere _appearance_ of an input is "useful" is it not?

As an application evolves over time, servers can add/remove inputs at
selected points in the user-agent's interactions w/ the server, too.
These decisions can be completely context dependent. For example,
selected users (admins) might see diff inputs than others (guests).
During certain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does
support writes) inputs could simply be removed from forms for a time.
Workflows could be altered to move inputs from one form to another;
indicating when selected data elements are valid.

All of the variances I've listed here work with a "fixed" set of
inputs (or app-level vocabulary); IOW, there is no need to introduce
brand new input "names" That means the set of variances I've defined
work w/ user-agents there there is not human directly driving the
interactions (i.e. M2M cases).

If you add a human at runtime (i.e. H2M cases), you now have the
possibility of introducing entirely new inputs (i.e expanding the
app-level vocabulary) and continuing to evolve the app.

In fact, as Jon Moore (I think it was him) has pointed out, as long as
you code an M2M user-agent to treat all "unknown" input elements as
"pass through" (i.e. continue to include them in URI templates
(HTML.FORM@method="get") and body templates (HTML.FORM@method="post")
AND provide defaults for these brand-new input elements, then even M2M
use cases support evolution over time that includes "unknown" inputs.

Are there other features you have in mind that have not been included here?

To: mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt;


&gt; what is it about those other things (ops, encoding, URL) that
&gt; remains "useful' at runtime?

At runtime I can read action="{url}" and method="{method}" from the
&lt;form ...&gt; tag. From that my program can decide what the server wants
it to do. No need for a hard coded "post here" URL in my client. So
these elements are "useful" at runtime because it makes it possible
for the server to influence the client's behavior.

But I cannot see how tags like &lt;input name="{name}"/&gt; can change be
client's behavior at runtime. The client must have hard coded
knowledge of "{name}" - it cannot discover what "{name}" is at
runtime. So, at compile time, the developer reads the form, and using
his eyes and brain, decides what input tag is used for something. Then
he hard codes "{name}" into his client.

So, can the client discover something useful from &lt;input
name="{name}"/&gt; at runtime?

Did that explain it?

While writing this I was reminded of default values in &lt;input&gt; tags.
So, one useful, discoverable, feature of a input definition, is the
default value for that input. And hidden inputs adds other extra
values that the client need not know about. More?

The &lt;select&gt;&lt;option/&gt;&lt;/select&gt; structure makes it possible for the server to provide a valid list of acceptable values at runtime.  If the choices were something like Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, that could be taken care of in the documentation, but if the choices are dynamic, based on the state of the application, such as a list of people that who's names start with "a", or your 10 most recent deposits or something like that, it's quite convenient.  You could have a link with a @rel that indicated that it would provide you with the legitimate values for that field, but having it inline can be quite convenient.

Ok.

The if-match parameter could be called anything it's just a token that's
needed to keep the request idempotent. The subset resource is not being
retrieved so the client won't have an ETag for it.. I guess you could just
use the ETag from the collection and stick a corresponding If-Match in the
PUT request to the subset. Is that what you are getting at? It's definitely
easier from the clients point of view if it's just stuck in the URI, plus I
don't think it matters that much in this instance.. perhaps you can expand
on the problems it would cause?

As for URI templates in a link - a client of the app will know it is
dealing with a URI template because it's accessing the 'subset' relation..
what's the issue there?

Apologies for upsetting your stomach, once you've got yourself together
please could you expand a bit on what the actual issues are?

Mike

<pre>You introduce coupling to your definition to understand a link.

An atom link expects an identifier, not an identifier template. Same goes with rfc5988.

You establish with those known links a relationship between two resources, the current one and the resource /blah/{introyourtemplatehere}

Rewriting what identifiers mean (here, from identification to identification builder) is shoehorning concepts into one that should not be mucked about with (the identifier of a resource).

After that, if one wants to write a media type that has the same tag name as HTML and atom but puts into the target uri an identifier builder, and one doesn't care for introducing unnecessary confusion, or one decides that rewriting what identifying a resource means (and it's been attempted uselessly many times on this list and others), then one can of course write that media type in that way.

I highly doubt that anyone in that disposition would do so consciously and at the same time read that email, so for most intent and purposes no one actually need that reminder that templates are not identifiers and that putting templates of identifiers is like using chilli puree instead of hemorhoide cream, you'll manage to put it there but you completely missed the difference between the two.

 Seeing link tags (and headers) with URI templates in them made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

Ok.

The if-match parameter could be called anything it's just a token that's needed to keep the request idempotent. The subset resource is not being retrieved so the client won't have an ETag for it.. I guess you could just use the ETag from the collection and stick a corresponding If-Match in the PUT request to the subset. Is that what you are getting at? It's definitely easier from the clients point of view if it's just stuck in the URI, plus I don't think it matters that much in this instance.. perhaps you can expand on the problems it would cause?

As for URI templates in a link - a client of the app will know it is dealing with a URI template because it's accessing the 'subset' relation.. what's the issue there?

Apologies for upsetting your stomach, once you've got yourself together please could you expand a bit on what the actual issues are?

Cheers,
Mike

Within the confines of the uniform interface, I would go with a GET or POST and link to that resource, maybe using a form-like construct which tells the clients e.g. two URIs which make a range of documents.


It's also possible to do something along these lines which could work with PUT:

&lt;link rel="subset" href="/some_collection?from={from_index}&amp;to={to_index}&amp;if-match=219837891723981723" /&gt;

Note, the if-match parameter is hard-coded into the representation by the server to keep the request idempotent.

adding/removing inputs in representations may "have little/no value"

as for the example, replace "admin/guest" w/ any number of external or

- queue full/queue empty
- etc.

<pre>So following your argument, there is really no reason whatsoever to standardise the link header with custom relationships, as if you don't understand the relationship you can do nothing with the link. The arc is not pointing to a resource anymore anyway so you've given up all value. 

In my pedantic view, breaking expectations won't work and shoehorning is an issue. 

Thanks god Firefox doesn't start understanding uri templates in href attributes, this would lead to fragmentation, and even non pedantic people would agree that it's not a good idea.

How significant their impact on evolvability is in real terms.

i.e. examples of changes in M2M application flow which are afforded by

linking).

No no, just to share my perspective on whether or not they do - in the
hope that I can understand how, in practical terms, forms allow you to
achieve interactions and changes to your system which could not be
afforded with links.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; During certain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does

&gt;

Sure, I guess my point was that this capability doesn't really set
forms apart, because this type interaction is already possible with
links and relations.

I think all of the above are important considerations, because
introducing forms into your application places additional requirements
on your clients.
For many, reducing the barrier to adoption by making consumption of
your application as easy as possible is important - so with stuff like
forms it's worth weighing this against their benefits.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Mike:

When the implementation calls for the ability to provide support for
representing a varying set of possible inputs within a response, i use
the "form" pattern (URI Templates, Body Templates, whatever name you
like) that is appropriate to the selected media type (HTML.FORM,
XML.XFORMS, custom templating, etc.). This has proved "effective" and
"sufficient" for my work. In addition, it is "desirable", "useful",
etc. to my personal design sense.

I have yet to find other ways to model this varying set of inputs
within a response representation that are as (or more) "effective",
"sufficient", "desirable", "useful", etc.  I am not at all interested
in proving to anyone that they, too, should adopt my personal
valuation of this pattern for the same use cases I choose over any
other patterns. I am also open to learning new ways to support the
representation of varying sets of inputs within a response.

Yes, varability introduces additional complexity. whether the
variability is "needed", "useful", "worth the effort", etc. is a value
judgement each designer/implementor makes. This complexity may be
exacerbated when a human is not the primary driver of the client and
therefore the presence of humans as part of the "live evaluation" of
each representation is certainly a factor in making judgments about
suitability of a representation design (i.e. giving humans binary
representations to visual evaluate and interact w/ is proly
inappropriate).

<pre>Lots of good feedback. Thank you guys. My thoughts were a bit along Mike 
Kellys' - why on earth would the server vary the set of inputs - the client 
would still be working with a specific goal in mind, and thereby be hard 
coded to use a specific set of inputs.

I don't have a clear picture of a good scenario for varying inputs in a M2M 
setup (and never mind that) - but I certainly accept that it can be relevant 
in exactly the same way as a varying set of links can be - just at another 
level that I haven't seen a use for yet.

Anyways, thanks for the input.

Mike A.:
&gt; Certainly the mere _appearance_ of an input is "useful" is it not?

Well, that's what I was trying to figure out :-)

&gt; &gt; Don't forget that method in hypertext, is also a function of URI. I
&gt; &gt; wish this list was easier to search, I know I re-wrote the HTML 4.01
&gt; &gt; text concerning form methods and posted it here as an example, once.
&gt; &gt; Instead of HTTP methods, HTML should use tokens descriptive of
&gt; &gt; sender intent. Because if the URI is mailto: the method won't be
&gt; &gt; POST, will it? Even though that's what it says in the markup?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd rather see protocol-agnostic markup rather than bindings to
&gt; &gt; specific protocols, regardless of media type...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I think that's interesting.. but I'm not clear where and how you
&gt; would map these protocol-agnostic control elements to the various
&gt; protocols/URI schemes, if you don't do it in the media type.
&gt; 

Where does any such mapping exist for links in HTML?

http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html

Clearly, the semantics are retrieval, it's up to the client developer
what protocols to support over time, and map to the appropriate method
in the intermediary or user-agent code which implements the media type.
Browsers still understand the ftp: scheme, but dropped gopher: in 2010.

This change in scheme support affects all supported media types.  It is
orthogonal to media type, so don't protocol-bind your media types.  HTML
has seen protocols come and go, and will continue to be served over
HTTP 2.0 with yet another port # and URI scheme and perhaps different
method names -- this has always made its HTTP form bindings look rather
quaint, IOW method='get' should be operation='retrieve' with no more
discussion of protocol than for &lt;a&gt; and &lt;link/&gt;, as in none whatsoever.

Is that really that clear? It is just the default behavior of browsers and
thus, by far, the most common one (at least for HTTP, what about mailto,
e.g.?). The semantics depend, on the rel and rev attributes according to
that document.

That's true.. but I don't know how feasible that really is. HTML sits on top
of an application level protocol (HTML or something else) which has its own
semantics that might not always match 1:1 to HTML semantics.. Again, think
of a mailto-link. How should a client retrieve such a "web resource"? It's
simple not possible, and yet mailto-links and even forms work.

&gt; quaint, IOW method='get' should be operation='retrieve' with no more
&gt; discussion of protocol than for &lt;a&gt; and &lt;link/&gt;, as in none whatsoever.

But it wasn't specified that way. It was clearly bound to the HTTP methods..
Nevertheless browsers are able map these HTTP semantics to other schemes -
is that really any different? There's still time to change that for HTML5 if
you think that it would be important to change this:

Huh? Are you saying, you want to switch from polling to push when number of users grow?

I'd suggest that, the more number of users you have, the less is push a good architectural choice. Better to make use of HTTP caching to decrease umber of requests that actually hit your backend.

Look at archived feeds for this purpose &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005&gt; or check out &lt;http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons&gt; which I think is indeed a very practical solution despite its 'esoteric' appeal at first glance :-)

If you feel you must use push, then there are solutions already such as XMPP.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

I'm searching a java rest framework or JAX-RS implementation that allows me to 
configure the dispatcher at runtime through an API. In JAX-RS it is only 
possible to do the configuration with @Path and @HttpMethod annotations or by 
effectively building your own dispatcher.

I'm searching for:

dispatcher.addResource("/my/{path}", Resource.class) or
dispatcher.addResource("/2nd/path", resourceHandlerFactory)

Thank you!

Well, try pushing the Twitter stream to zillions of clients :-)

What I was referring to is to split the stream in archived (==static) pages that are then cacheable.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Dear REST enthousiast,

Do you think there’s a joint future for Services and the Semantic Web?
Or is your opinion that they’ll never work together?

Either answer is great, because we want you to join the discussion at the LAPIS workshop!
It’s roughly one month before the deadline, so consider submitting a paper (4 or 8 pages) or a discussion starter (1 paragraph).

Comments? Questions?
Don’t mail me – just submit them directly to the workshop ;-)

Best,

Ruben

    LAPIS 2012
    Linked APIs for the Semantic Web
    ESWC 2012 workshop
    May 27th, 2012
    http://lapis2012.linkedservices.org/

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


"The Web as I envisioned it, we have not seen it yet."
  – Tim Berners-Lee

"Services and the Semantic Web: it's complicated."
  – anonymous gossip

"Semantic Web and APIs: an essential problem in need of a fresh look."
  – LAPIS 2012 mission


=======================
 Challenge for Papers – What do *you* have to say about Linked APIs and the Semantic Web?
=======================


LAPIS 2012 in 5 questions
-------------------------

Why?       The Web has changed: services become resource-oriented APIs. We must react now.
Goal?      Exploring the opportunities resource-oriented APIs offer, especially in combination with links.
For whom?  Motivated researchers from the REST, Semantic Web, and Linked Data communities.
What?      A truly interactive workshop, driven by constructive discussion and dialog.
Format?    An inspiring day. Morning: talks and dialog. Afternoon: brainstorm and discussion


LAPIS 2012 in 5 bullets
-----------------------
The main goal of the LAPIS workshop is to give birth to new ideas and visions, through presentations that encourage interaction and discussion. Topics of discussion include:

- defining Linked APIs, what they could look like, and what role links can play
- identifying the essential building blocks for enabling Linked APIs
- pinpointing challenges to move from resource-oriented APIs towards Linked APIs
- capturing added value of Linked APIs for the Semantic Web and REST communities
- designing applications by connecting Linked Data and Linked APIs for reading and writing
The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.


LAPIS 2012 wants your submission
--------------------------------
Regular paper (8 pages)
    Regular papers focus on new ideas or technologies you have developed that relate to Linked APIs.
    We are very open-minded towards the workshop scope, and expect the same from you.
   
    Be original. Be creative. But most of all: be at least a little controversial – generate discussion.
    We're not looking for the next Big Invention. Workshop participants want to discover and to learn.
    
    Details: http://lapis2012.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/
  
Vision paper (4 pages)
    Vision papers focus on creative ideas and concepts, even if there are no concrete results yet.
    Having more questions than answers can in fact be a plus… if you find the right questions.
    
    Details: http://lapis2012.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/
  
Wild ideas and discussion starters (1 paragraph)
    Besides the traditional papers component, we would also like to run an experiment.
    We want your wildest ideas and discussion topics to make LAPIS 2012 an interactive workshop.
    
    Details: http://lapis2012.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/
  

Motivated for this challenge?
-----------------------------

Great! Visit us at http://lapis2012.linkedservices.org/
Your deadline is March 4th, 2012, and the workshop will take place on May 27th or 28th.

LAPIS 2012 is organized by Craig Knoblock, Barry Norton, Ruben Verborgh, Sebastian Speiser, and Maria Maleshkova.
LAPIS 2012 is driven by you, its participants. Come and discuss with us!

Subject:How to make RPC-like call RESTfully<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

I am trying to do the best I can for our API needs to avoid making some REST calls basically be RPC calls. I can't explain in detail regarding the company I work for as we're still in stealth/startup mode so I'll do the best I can to make sense.

Our API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to "scrape" some web sites. Basically we pull down a sites login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed to us, and attempt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we're really not trying to randomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will ask their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we'll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending back a response to the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far as I can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on our server side. It's basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating user credentials for different services. The consumer gets the benefit of being able to avoid having to do the page scraping and/or using other service APIs..they just use our one API and specify the service and pass the credentials. 


The problem is.. we cant use GET since you can't pass a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but that seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in credentials (possibly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above, we're not storing these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we're merely checking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service selected (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag of whether or not the creds worked changes..but that's not really the resource.

So I am asking you experts.. how is something like this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I've read the past few years, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially if the community was "ok" with using RPC like syntax with the ease of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the community balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am left to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST. 


Feel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely missing some key points about using REST. I think I have a pretty good understanding of it, but no doubt there is room to learn.

Thank you.</pre><br><br><br><br><br>

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Kevin:

not sure if this helps, but regarding the " as far as I can tell this does
not modify a resource, or create a new resource" line, i'll share this
observation:

First, the POST/PUT actions are _not_ reserved for creating/modifying some
concrete entity in your server's problem domain. You can use these
idempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodies to the
server for processing of all kinds including comparing the data against
data on the server, logging for later use, etc.

I often "model" actions such as "login", "ticket request", "queue up a
job", etc. as a "write-record" pattern. IOW, if you attempt to log into the
server, I might log the action (date, time, username, other context data)
for later audit review. When I do this, it makes good sense to use a POST
w/ body to send the data. These actions often result in a new "resource"
which hold the results of the attempt ("here's your ticket", "you job has
been added to the queue", etc.) and sometimes this resource will be
updated/refreshed over the life of the job, etc.

I think that would fit your scenario just fine. you need not save all the
data sent by the user (i.e. password, etc.)

Subject:A Graphical Modeling Language for RESTful applications - Evaluation<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Dear list members,

I am currently working on my Master's thesis at the University of
Hagen. The goal of my thesis is the development of a graphical
modeling language for resource-oriented (aka RESTful) applications
following criteria defined by Daniel Moody [1].
Part of this development is also the evaluation of the new language I
have developed regarding these criteria.

I would therefore like to ask you for your support by taking the
questionnaire I have devised to do that evaluation. Filling out the
questionnaire will take about 20 minutes. It is available online under
the following URL:
http://bit.ly/visualRest

As a small "thank you" for filling out the questionnaire, you also
have the chance to win one of three books afterwards (details can be
found under the aforementioned URL).

The questionnaire is online and ready to take input starting today
(February 7th) and will be closed on February 20th.

I would really appreciate your help and am looking forward to your
answers.

Thank you and best regards,
Oliver van Porten

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] How to make RPC-like call RESTfully<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>    Thank you for the replies. Both you and Ben seem to be saying the same thing.. some sort of job queue resource. I probably should have added that all of our API calls other than GETs are async. They return immediately.. so essentially our API becomes one big job queue. We also support callbacks. Consumers register a URL with us that we then send notifications back to. We will eventually support polling as well, and in doing so we'll need to respond with resource IDs, and in some cases we do so that when we send notifications via the callback to them, they can match up the request we make to their callback handler (with body) with the ID that they were given when they made the async request to our API. IOW, some of our resources create a resource to generate the id, send that back right away, then process the bulk of the request in an EJB 3 async method. Some of our calls will require possibly several seconds of time to process for one user and we
 don't want to tie up the pipes.. some of them may even take minutes to days (again..can't provide the details I wish I could..but it's possible they might take some time before a response could be given back to the consumer). Think of it as an IM.. I can send it to you and you could respond almost immediately if you are there..but if you're not, you may respond with an auto-reply immediately then send me an email later with more details. Anyway, I do like the idea of a job queue of sorts.. primarily because it gives an actual resource ID a consumer can then use to poll, and more so in our callback scenario, associate with to a callback we send with an id they can use to match to one they were given when they sent the initial request to us. We don't do that right now with this particular scenario, so that would work well here.

&gt;not sure if this helps, but regarding the "
as far as I can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource" line, i'll share this observation:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;First, the POST/PUT actions are _not_ reserved for creating/modifying some concrete entity in your server's problem domain. You can use these idempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodies to the server for processing of all kinds including comparing the data against data on the server, logging for later use, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I often "model" actions such as "login", "ticket request", "queue up a job", etc. as a "write-record" pattern. IOW, if you attempt to log into the server, I might log the action (date, time, username, other context data) for later audit review. When I do this, it makes good sense to use a POST w/ body to send the data. These actions often result in a new "resource" which hold the results of the attempt ("here's your ticket", "you job has been added to the queue", etc.) and sometimes this resource will be updated/refreshed over the life of the job, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think that would fit your scenario just fine. you need not save all the data sent by the user (i.e. password, etc.)

&gt;&gt;Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am trying to do the best I can for our API needs to avoid making some REST calls basically be RPC calls. I can't explain in detail regarding the company I work for as we're still in stealth/startup mode so I'll do the best I can to make sense.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Our API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to "scrape" some web sites. Basically we pull down a sites login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed to us, and attempt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we're really not trying to randomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will ask their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we'll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending back a response to the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far as I can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on our server side. It's basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating user credentials for different services. The consumer gets the benefit of being able to avoid having to do the page scraping and/or using other service APIs..they just use our one API and specify the service and pass the credentials. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The problem is.. we cant use GET since you can't pass a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but that seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in credentials (possibly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above, we're not storing these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we're merely checking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service selected (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag of whether or not the creds worked changes..but that's not really the resource.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I am asking you experts.. how is something like this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I've read the past few years, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially if the community was "ok" with using RPC like syntax with the ease of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the community balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am left to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Feel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely missing some key points about using REST. I think I have a pretty good understanding of it, but no doubt there is room to learn.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

Subject:Stateless services requiring authentication in an AJAX application<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have a web application that has many web services and an AJAX web client as well as some mobile clients.  I won't call them RESTful web services, but I'm trying to get them closer.

One problem I have is that I am trying to avoid having any application state on the server.  I have that with the exception of having an authenticated session.  Nothing is stored in the session except for the user's "Subject" which knows whether or not it is authenticated and who it is authenticated as.  

But I want to get all the way to having no session, but that means I have to authenticate with every request.  My mobile clients have no trouble doing this.  (In fact, they do it already.)  However, this seems to be rather tricky from a browser.  

If the ENTIRE application was in one web page, then you could just store the credentials in memory.  However, if you have to go from one web page to another, it starts to get hairy.

Does anyone on this list have any best practices for avoiding having any session in web applications (Human to Machine) requiring authentication?

Subject:RE: [rest-discuss] How to make RPC-like call RESTfully<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre> Quick two points on this:

ID is already part of the application protocl, its' the URI. If you  model it independently, you may be introducing coupling back to a second identification constraint in the protocl that is not part of rest.

As for alternatives to the client-server pull-based interaction mechanisms that are part of ReST, there's a lot of interesting architectural discussions to be had on those, and sometimes the benefits do outweight the costs. Be aware however that those are not part of the ReSTful architectural style, so any effort to discuss those would probably provoke a lot of positive conversation if you introduce them as alternatives / different / cost-benefit analysis. You can still design async work with HTTP and still get leverage out of *that* app protocol, and you can also build *something else* that fits the same requirements in an architecture that doesn't conform to ReST. As long as you're clear on the boundary within the two, I'm sure any of us architect devs / rationale people will happily discuss those alternatives and what positives and negatives they present.

<pre>First of all, thanks for filling in the questionnaire.

The resource types are due to Tikov [1]. He identified them as the
concepts that appear in many if not all REST applications.
The book is german, though, and I don't know if there is an englisch
translation (yet?).

I did not include any free text fields other than the one at the end
because I will not be able to evaluate the comments there in the time
that I have left for my thesis.

Also, the questionnaire is mainly concerned with syntax, not so much
with semantics.
The semantic basis for my work is due to [2].

However, do you remember - by any chance - for which questiosn you
thought that I'm enforcing a staically designed contract?

<pre>I should also have mentioned that the language is ment for modeling
the server only.
So, basically, when you run some sort of code generator on the model
you will get "server code" for the resource types.
It it not meant as a contract between client and server.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Stateless services requiring authentication in an AJAX application<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Interesting HTTP Q (not related to REST, of course)...

Here's my list of HTTP auth solutions when working w/ common browsers:

LET THE BROWSER HANDLE IT ALL
I usually use HTTPS + Basic Auth for browser apps and I let the
browser handle this detail for me. IOW, I set up the server to require
auth for the URIs and let things "flow" from there. No special coding
on the browser client at all.

SCRIPTED PRE-AUTH
Occasionally, I'll set up a scripted "pre-auth" on the browser. In
this case, I use a small JS lib to handle the base64 encoding and
prompt the user to provide user/pass locally, encode it and stuff it
into the headers for ajax calls. I do this on every call, tho and that
can get tedious.

BASIC AUTH COOKIE HACK
Finally, (and I'm not really proud of this one....) I sometimes stuff
the Base64-encoded Basic Auth value as a cookie (sheesh!) and set up
the server to peek into the cookie space before throwing a 403 upon
receiving an un-auth'ed request. The advantage here is the cookie is
retained across pages.

That's what I do.

Good point.

Digest works fine. However, when I move along this "solution scale"
(pre-auth, then cookie-hack) it's harder to continue to support
digest. that's why I didn't mention it here.

In reality, I let the server and browser sort out their preferred auth
mode (i.e. I almost always implement servers that support both Basic
and Digest, rarely OAuth).

So, yes, Digest is cool.

<pre>When letting the browser handle it all, how do you handle the "sign out" use case?

Also, I disagree that this is not related to REST.  A lot of services that are called RESTful but aren't are there to support AJAX.  One big reason they aren't RESTful tends to be a lack of HATEOS.  But even if you do have HATEOS in your AJAX calls, I don't know of anyone who doesn't have a session on the server to keep track of authentication, which also violates REST.  Now, the fact that I don't know anyone doing it is hardly an exhaustive search.  So the question has to do with REST thus:

Can you use truly RESTful web services that require authentication in an AJAX browser-based application.  The answer to this question, from your answer below, is yes.
Should you make those web services RESTful? If the answer to this is "no" then I see your point that this has nothing to do with REST (except to answer that question).  But I think the answer must be "yes, if it's feasible", so my question is about whether it is feasible/practical to do.  Is there a (good) reason no one seems to be doing it?
If you have a requirement to have a nice, pretty, branded login screen are you already stuck at that point? You can, with newer browsers, store the login credentials in a local data store to use on subsequent pages, but is that a good idea?
Say you only need to support the newer browsers and you don't have a problem storing the credentials in a local store.  You almost certainly have another requirement to let a user "sign out" so that subsequent requests do not get automatically authenticated by the browser.  Is this possible? If it's possible, how practical is it?
If it is practical, how are people doing it? Are there examples to look at for best practices? You provided three examples but even you don't seem very happy with any of them.  Does anyone else have other suggestions?

<pre>HTTPS + login cookie is perfectly stateless from the server side if implemented correctly (as a digitally signed token). There's no reason an AJAX client can't navigate "login" and "logout" link relations and/or forms, as long as they obey the same origin policy.

<pre>Jason:

SIGN OUT
HTTP Auth does not support "sign-out" so, by default, i do not expect
it when using HTTP Auth. However:
- when using browser-based auth, this is the browser's problem
- when using my pre-auth option or cookie-hack, i can use a flag to
"turn off" sending the auth bits on each call

IS THIS REST?
as for the whole "is this REST thing" I'll only point out that the
arch style in Fielding's dissertation has nothing to say about
authentication patterns. That is why I made the remark at the top.
This is not me trying to get in a dig or something, just making an
observation.

AJAX
I don't really follow how using XmlHttpRequest object from a browser
is primary to asking about using HTTP Auth or deciding if an
implementation follows Fielding's model. For example, I've written
quite a few "desktop" apps that don't use common browsers (i.e. all
complied code making direct HTTP calls and parsing the responses) and
was able to follow Fielding's model w/o any problem. As for "pretty
login", I think I covered that in the previous post (the pre-auth).

SESSION STATE
I suspect part of your question really has to do w/ state-handling
(not just auth, but the entire notion of maintaining state in a
dist-net app). Here, Fielding's model declares "Session state is
therefore kept entirely on the client"[1] to support the Layered
Sytsem [2] property in his model. And, as you point out, common Web
browsers make it tough to pull that off since,until recently, their
support for allowing servers to send code that "writes" state data to
the client has been limited to the cookie option. Yes, for "modern"
browsers, there is the WebStorage API that recently hit recommendation
status[3]. I've not used this in any production code; perhaps others
can comment on it's usefulness.

MY SESSION HACK FOR BROWSERS
For cases where i need to get around the "session state on the client"
problem common for browsers (no matter how "old" they are), I usually
create a server-side resource that holds all the "transient state" for
that logged in user. This is tied to the auth session and usually
cached w/ an etag to prevent chatty traffic where possible. again,
it's a hack, but it isolates the problem and makes it possible to:
- make this "session state" mobile (not tied to any single server),
- treat is as orthagonal to the server implementation (servers don't
_do_ anything with this stuff, it's the client that must ask for and
apply the state upon requests)
- implementation agnostic (since it's a separated component, future
client updates can take advantage of changes in state support w/o
affecting existing server implementations or "older" clients.

More than once, I've written server implementations that supported
both "desktop" and "browser" clients. In those cases, the desktop apps
kept their own state and the browsers used the server-side session
resources. The server itself (that handled the business scenario)
never knew the diff.

Hopefully this gives you some ideas on how to come up w/ a solution
that will work for your use cases.

I should also have mentioned that the language is ment for modeling
the server only.
So, basically, when you run some sort of code generator on the model
you will get "server code" for the resource types.
It it not meant as a contract between client and server.

&gt; modeling language for resource-oriented (aka RESTful) applications
&gt; following criteria defined by Daniel Moody [1].
&gt; Part of this development is also the evaluation of the new language I
&gt; have developed regarding these criteria.
&gt;
&gt; I would therefore like to ask you for your support by taking the

&gt;
&gt; As a small "thank you" for filling out the questionnaire, you also
&gt; have the chance to win one of three books afterwards (details can be

&gt;
&gt; The questionnaire is online and ready to take input starting today

Subject:API using 422 status code<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi guys,

in these days I'm writing an API consumer for a RoR-powered
webservice, which uses 422 status code (from WebDav) in HTTP
responses.
Here's an explanation about 422's usage: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/98002

I thought that a 400 Bad Request could be suitable for this scenario,
and dealing with non-standard HTTP status codes is something I do not
like at all.

What do you guys think? Is this an acceptable behaviour or should I
ask the API developer - which is paying me for developing the client
:) - to change it?

<pre>Hi,
Using 422 is fine. It isn't defined the HTTP spec but in RFC 2518, which is as cool. The HTTP spec allows for definition of new HTTP status codes. 

422 is used in a number of Web APIs. However, it may not be used as much in new APIs in the future, as the new definition of 400 in HTTP bis makes it less needed.

&gt; 
&gt; in these days I'm writing an API consumer for a RoR-powered
&gt; webservice, which uses 422 status code (from WebDav) in HTTP
&gt; responses.
&gt; Here's an explanation about 422's usage: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/98002
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that a 400 Bad Request could be suitable for this scenario,
&gt; and dealing with non-standard HTTP status codes is something I do not
&gt; like at all.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you guys think? Is this an acceptable behaviour or should I
&gt; ask the API developer - which is paying me for developing the client
&gt; :) - to change it?

How so? Me surprised :-)

One of the main incentive for 422 is that 400 is defined as meaning "The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax". Therefore 422 comes handy when you want to signal a client error which isn't "malformed syntax" and isn't covered by other 4xx codes, but comes from an "unprocessable entity".
The new definition of 400 in the current http-bis draft is broader: "The server cannot or will not process the request, due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax)". Hence, there is less incentives to use 422.

I disagree; if you get this impression then we may have to re-tune the 
definition of 400.

If 422 is a good match, there is absolutely no reason to use 400, no 
matter what we changed in HTTPbis.

With what exactly?

Well, I even wonder if the WebDAV WG would have minted 422 if 400 was defined as in the http-bis draft back then.

BTW, I find the new definition much better than the current one (which is too narrow given that 400 is also meant to be the fallback for unrecognized 4xx codes).

Yes, that's why we changed it. But this wasn't done to discourage the

Good to know!

So I guess that in the process of writing a generic HTTP client, I
should implement rfc-2616 (draft standard) and its webdav extension,
rfc-4918 (proposed standard), am I right?

Actually, you should implement the HTTPbis drafts 
(&lt;http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/&gt;).

If you do things right, you won't need to consider specific extensions. 
So design your API so it's not limited to a predefined set of 
methods/status codes/header field names.

Yeah, but the approach used by others is pretty different.

Just to make an example of a really well engineered php framework (Symfony2):
https://github.com/symfony/HttpFoundation/blob/master/Response.php#L52

If you look at the status codes, this library implements rfc2616 (and
it's because of this that a 422 status code drives my API client nuts,
as I'm using Symfony to handle the HTTP layer).

Do you guys think that limiting themselves at rfc2616 is too naive?

Subject:Creating parent-resource &amp; sub-resources in one shot<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>How to model resource creation for the following scenario:
Assume that we have a parent resource (R) and it has many sub-resources
(SR1, SR2, .., SRN).
The scenario we have is:
    * When user POSTs on /R, we would like user to provide full input of
parent-resource (R) &amp; all of its sub-resources (SR1, SR2, .., SRN). This
is to optimize for bandwidth &amp; unnecessary round-trips. Is it acceptable
per REST guidelines to accept input for multiple resources (&amp; create
those resources) by POSTing under one resource? Or we MUST create a
separate operation-resource such as /CreateRAndSRs that takes all the
required input and underneath creates the resources of R, SR1, SR2, ..,
SRN.

    * Client should be able to fetch (GET) and update (PUT) the parent
and sub-resources individually once created.

Thanks,Shahzaib.

<pre>In reading the literature on RESTful interfaces, I've noticed that some people use Extended (or non-standard) HTTP Headers.  Interface versioning seems to be one popular use..   Other than recent RFC drafts concerning the suggestion to no longer use the "X-" prefix, very little else is written.

Clearly, one could get carried with Extended Headers, however they do have their uses.  I'm curious to hear people's opinions and guidelines on how, where, and under what situations to use Extended Headers within REST.

&gt;
&gt; What a server does upon receiving a POST request is entirely up to the
server. It can create a hundred resources, or none at all. Having a single
POST create more than one resource is a great way to reduce network rounds
trips.

&gt;
&gt;    - Client should be able to fetch (GET) and update (PUT) the parent and
&gt;    sub-resources individually once created.
&gt;
&gt; You will have to design your representations such that the client can
traverse from known resources to these newly created resources. One way
would be to have the server respond to the creation POST with a redirect to
the main resource (R). The representation of R would provide links to the
sub-resources. The client could then follow its nose to the individual
sub-resources as needed.

'Extended' headers, as you put it, aren't actually what you think. The 'X-'
prefix is meant for experimental headers, and thus are only meant to be used in
private experiments. They're not something that's meant to be seen in the wild,
but this convention unfortunately gets abused a lot.

You shouldn't be using 'X-' headers in HTTP except for your own personal
experiments.

<pre>I agree that this was the original intent, but the fact of the matter is that the "extension use case" has escaped into the wild.

RFC3864 exists for a reason.  It talks about experimental headers, but it also talks about a provisional repository containing headers that have been "adopted ad-hoc to address a locally occurring requirement; some of these have found widespread use"

Realizing that we are all treading water until HTTPbis is finished,
I'm looking for comments from people who felt the need to use headers in this way.

I agree that this was the original intent, but the fact of the matter is that the "extension use case" has escaped into the wild.

RFC3864 exists for a reason.  It talks about experimental headers, but it also talks about a provisional repository containing headers that have been "adopted ad-hoc to address a locally occurring requirement; some of these have found widespread use"

Realizing that we are all treading water until HTTPbis is finished,
I'm looking for comments from people who felt the need to use headers in this way.

<pre>Hi,

I was reading this guideline [1] about resource identifiers and I'm not
sure how a client would be able to navigate to the resource just having the
entry point URL and the identifier.

How does the client find out the URL structure to be used to fetch the
resource? URI template? Maybe a search feature that uses OpenSearch? How do
you usually solve this?

Let me know of any examples of REST APIs that solved this problem.

Subject:is it necessary for me to keep the xml content consistencein Post and Get action<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>hi all 
i have one question in my REST api. the Q as detailed below:
 Post used to create a Job with job name some some other properties. e.g
&lt;job&gt;
&lt;name&gt;joba&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;content&gt;content&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;job&gt;

Get returns the job @ uri /jobs/joba
&lt;Job&gt;
&lt;name&gt;joba&lt;name&gt;
&lt;content&gt;content&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;CreationTime&gt;2011-12-2&lt;/CreationTime&gt;
&lt;LastModifiedTime&gt;2011-12-2&lt;/LastModifiedTime&gt;
&lt;LastRunStatus&gt;Success&lt;/LastRunstatus&gt;
&lt;/Job&gt;
in Get response, except the basic data that sent by Post, it returns other information, such as CreationTime, LastModifiedTime and LastRunStatus. then the xml difference comes between post and get. SO my question is: is it necessary for me to keep the XML consistence in post and action.

Yes, interesting catch. The guideline may misguide to one of the options you mention, that I dislike a lot: URL Templates. That makes the server lose control of the URL space, as it it is forced to follow a strict construction that also exposes resource information.

I may make a difference between a resource Identifier and a simple entity identifier. The resource identifier is always the URL, that may change over time. We create a resource using an entity (pure information) and it is stored somewhere and a URI is assigned to it. If you have the entity id like the UUID, the only hope you have is searching the web space for a resource that may be representing it. You can have more than one, actually, and there should be a way in the app to get to it (searching is the normal option here).

So, the questions is not about the client finding the URL structure, but of the client finding the search service. Say, we can have a link in the welcome page that says "Find item by ID". Simple.

If you move a representation between two URIs, you have changed neither the resource (the two things identified by the URIs) nor the identifiers. You've changed the state of the resource, and that's it.

Just because you move the representation from /posts/latest to /post/nearlylatest and assign a new represetnation to /posts/latest, you have not changed what the resource is or how it is identified, you just changed the state (the entity in this case, where entity = body + metadata, which is what we call the representation).

Subject:Re: Resource Identifiers<br>
Message:<br><br>

Hi Sebastien.

Not sure if you mean my message when you mention the confusing sentence construction, or the original link. In any case, you are correct: my use of the word "representing" may cause some confusion with the "representation" term used in REST. Apart from that, I don't understand why the rest of your clarification, which seems quite correct but in a point, but unrelated. Let me clarify:

1. The UUDI mentioned in the fedora project link is, as I understand, an internal ID representing some data entity. The confusion comes when we call that an "Identifier" and mention, in the same sentence, that we can access the resource having that ID and the entry point URI. That ID is supposed to be created by the server in order to permanently identify the "resource", since the URIs may change over time, the Fedora site says. This is like having two resource identifiers, one that is the URI and another one internal.

2. My explanation: that is not quite right. That internal identifier is part of the entity implementation and should not be used to identify the resource by itself, but it can be used to identify the entity. The resource identifier is the URI. Those internal identifiers are nice at the business level, and the correct way of using them is through a search or other mechanism that can map that internal ID to one resource, using REST constrains. Simple. 

3. So, to me, it is a bad practice to make the server create an ID outside the business layer, expose it and somehow associate that to the resource identification, say by using URI templates. This leads to business exposure in the identification, plus reduces the server control on the URI space, plus some other inconveniences.

4. About the resource and representation, yes, people usually think of a resource to be its representation, or that a resource is simply a data record. They are three completely different things, although a resource may require the representation and the data record to be implemented.

5. Now, entity to me is not an implementation. We have the logical model where we define an entity, with properties and behavior and such, and then in the "physical" model we implement that, either with a data record, an EDI file or an XML file, a service or an object. That is, I disagree a little with your definition of entity= body+medatada= representation. A representation is simply a bunch of bytes, a copy of state, a description message, not an implementation of the entity. We can have some entity information, we put it in a format (say plain XML) and send it to the server, which in turn creates a resource (that would be an entity implementation) and that resource starts its life somewhere in that cloud. We may get all or partial information from that entity implementation (the resource) by requesting a representation of the resource using the URI to identify it. So, entity (pure information) &lt;&gt; resource(Implementation of an Entity) &lt;&gt; representation (binary "view" of a resource).

Hope this allows a clearer reading of what I meant.

Cheers!

William Martinez.

Subject:Where should I POST to?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi everyone,

A hypothetical blog application:
- /posts/43 identifies a blog post resource
- /posts/43/comments/3 identifies a comment resource on this blog post

Here are different ideas to create a comment:
- POST on /posts/43
  According to the definition of POST [1], this should be acceptable under “annotation of existing resources”.
- POST on /posts/43/comments
  According to the definition of POST [1], this should be acceptable under “posting a message […]”

The question: which one(s) of the above seem acceptable, which one is “best”?

For this, you also have to consider that the resource identified by “/posts/43/comments”—while it clearly exists and is well-defined—is rather meaningless to the application in question, since:
- People will never GET /posts/43/comments, because the comments will be served along with every representation of the /posts/43 resource
- PUT and DELETE on /posts/43/comments will also never be of practical use (you can’t update all comments at once nor delete the comments collection).

So, rephrasing, do I need the /posts/43/comments resource (which will only serve for POST requests) or can I happily POST to /posts/43 in a correct hypermedia API?

Both are acceptable. If you expose the collection of comments as a resource, there are benefits to use this resource as a factory for creating individual comment resources using POST interactions (i.e., your second idea).

&gt; For this, you also have to consider that the resource identified by â€œ/posts/43/commentsâ€â€”while it clearly exists and is well-definedâ€”is rather meaningless to the application in question, since:

You can happily POST to /post/43

They're both valid. The first option is arguably a slightly better
interaction as it's more visible because, as you say, the comments are
represented from this resource and so a successful POST would
automatically invalidate it in any participating caches. That's quite
useful because it allows you more generous Cache-Control max-age
values - it's particularly useful for gateway caching, specifically.

If your clients are driven by hypertext you can pick whichever one you
want.. if you found that you needed to switch from one to the other -
changing the URI would not disturb your clients.

Mike

<pre>Hi Mike and Philippe,

Thanks for helping. I see that both options are acceptable.

&gt; If your clients are driven by hypertext you can pick whichever one you
&gt; want.. if you found that you needed to switch from one to the other -
&gt; changing the URI would not disturb your clients.

Well, my envisioned clients are indeed driven by hypertext.
I’m working on describing hypermedia APIs, and currently, collection resources such as ../comments pose a problem:

It’s easy to describe the relationship between a blog post and an individual comment:
  Link: &lt;/posts/43/comment/3&gt;; rel=“http://example.org/blog#comment”
Clients just need to understand the http://example.org/blog#comment relation then.

However, it’s more difficult to link to the comments (plural) resource as well:
  Link: &lt;/posts/43/comments&gt;; rel=“http://example.org/blog#comments”
because this means that 1) I’d have to maintain all link relationships twice (singular and plural) and 2) hypermedia clients have to understand twice as many relationship types.

So if I can stick to posting to the /posts/43 resource, that’s a lot easier. Thanks!

Best,

Ruben

&gt;
&gt; This is a great point. Yet another failing of the default way that
&gt; Rails does things; you'd be POSTing to /posts/42/comments in that
&gt; case...

The default, sure. It's trivial to overcome though - Rails' routing is
very flexible.

&gt;
&gt; I tend to prefer the second approach for scenarios like this:

* POST /posts/43/comments is a well defined resource (it's a collection of
all the comments so far for this post)

* It is perfectly reasonable to support getting all the comments for a post
in a single call (GET /posts/43/comments),
  perhaps with optional query parameters to control filtering or pagination.

* If you have other sorts of resources related to your root resource, it's
straightforward to name
  additional collections ("POST /posts/43/attachments" will add an
attachment to that post)
  and I don't have any ambiguity if I want the attachments (GET
/posts/43/attachments) or
  the comments (GET /posts/43/comments).

In all cases, I'd suggest including the ".../comments" and
".../attachments" links (in whatever format you're using for
representations) as resource links in the post representation returned by
"GET /posts/43" so that a client doesn't have to know or care which choice
you made ... they just follow the provided links.

&gt; - People will never GET /posts/43/comments, because the comments will be served along with every representation of the /posts/43 resource

One could choose to have a GET to /posts/43/comments 301 to 
/posts/43#comments. Or to just add a GET that returns an entity of just 
the comments, or simply say "well, if I made GET do anything it would be 
to return an entity that shows just the comments, but since it'll never 
be used I'm not going to bother implementing it".

The main reason I'd argue in favour of posting to /posts/43 is that the 
relationship between /posts/43 and /posts/43 is obvious, while the 
relationship between it and what is (relative to it) ./43/comments is 
less so. Had the post had the URI /posts/43/ with a trailing slash, then 
this would be less so pressing.

All of this is about niceties though. /adfs/d32rsdf/1ras89%20sfdakl 
would be just as good as either from a purely REST perspective, but 
niceties do matter.

Subject:Related resource: Inlined or linked<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I think the first time I saw this pattern in Jon Moore's oredev talk on
Hypermedia APIs. In his demo he replaced links to subresources with their
full representations and the client continued to work.

Mike Amundsen in his hypermedia book talks about this approach as well.
Specifically:

"The code above assumes that a call to the initial UI will always return a
representation that contains the Collection+JSON template object. While
this is true for the implementation we are testing, that might not be true
for all servers. It is possible that servers will send only a link to the
template object..."

The part of documentation of the media type regarding the relation of the
resource containing the template and the template itself:

"The collection object MAY have a template object child property".

Note, nothing is mentioned about either template object is linked or
inlined. I assume it should be always inlined otherwise it's not clear what
the name of the link rel should be.

And then goes on with:

"It is important to review the semantic requirements fo the target media
type carefully in order to account for any possible variances in the way
representations may be presented by compliant servers. Never assume all
servers will implement the media type the same way."

It sounds like the related resource may be either linked or inlined -
whatever the server decides. I can understand the approach if the media
type explicitly says that there should be either a link OR an inlined
resource. But when it says there should be an inlined resource and the
server decides to return a link to it, then the server is not implementing
the media type anymore. And vice versa, when media type says there should
be a link, but the server returns an inline target resource.

So my question is rather broad, but please feel free to express any of your
thoughts on the topic: in which cases servers may decide to either go with
inlined or linked resource and clients should be expecting that possible
move from the servers?

Hi Vitaly.

In Atom it would be quite useful to have a summary representation in a feed
that represents a search result, but allow the full representation in a
"content-listing" resource. The summary would obviously link to the full
representation.

Switching to the full representation in a search result would also be
possible, but would need a separate URI, meaning a different resource.

<pre>You are correct that the media type definition has to allow for this degree of freedom or the server can't exercise it without potentially breaking compliant clients.

HTML5 microdata such as that described on http://schema.org/ would be an example media type; if an @itemprop is on an &lt;a&gt; tag, that's a pretty good indication that value is remote vs. inline; e.g.

&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Restaurant"&gt;
  &lt;a itemprop="address" href="…"/&gt; &lt;!-- linked/remote postal address --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Or:

&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Restaurant"&gt;
  &lt;div itemprop="address" itemtype="http://schema.org/PostalAddress"&gt;
    &lt;!-- inlined postal address --&gt;
   …
  &lt;/div&gt;

I like it, specifically your notion of decoupling from media type.  If
@profile exists and is defined by the media type, it should take
precedence over a generic rel='profile'.  It's an excellent solution
for those of us who find HTML 5's dropping of @profile reprehensible.

that's very good to hear! and i like the suggestion of defining how such 
a profile link may interact with a media-type specific profile 
mechanism, but the risk or challenge there is to figure out where this 
mechanism exists, and whether it "really means" the same thing. i guess 
we'll run into the finer points of this debate once we try to actually 
write down the semantics of the proposed link relation type.

True. It is easy to make the relationship from the blog post to a comment, and from each comment to the collection of all comments. But from the blog post to all comments is less convenient, all the more since we would serve all the comments in the post’s representation anyway.

&gt; All of this is about niceties though. /adfs/d32rsdf/1ras89%20sfdakl 
&gt; would be just as good as either from a purely REST perspective, but 
&gt; niceties do matter.

I beg to differ here: the question is not about the exact URI used, but about the resource that is identified by that URI.

I my example /posts/43 was the resource “blog post 43” and /posts/43/comments the resource “comments to blog post 43”.
Now whether the URI to these resources is /posts/43 and /posts/43/comments or /bar and /foo doesn’t matter; but they *are* different resources.
Therefore, my question was to which resource I should POST, i.e., what resource does /adfs/d32rsdf/1ras89%20sfdakl identify?

Best,

Ruben

While I like the idea per se, I don't think it's a good idea to repeat the "mistake" of XML to use HTTP URIs for things that are not supposed to be dereferenced. Why do you? Either create a new URI scheme for that or provide some useful information - e.g. a HTML page describing the profile or just a page linking to the profile's description.

developers out there don't know that namespaces in XML, e.g., are not and

some time ago I tried to look one of those up and landed at a W3 page that
explained that they are getting tens of gigabytes of traffic a day because
tools try to continuously dereference those URIs.

A link relation's value doesn't have to be an IRI (in fact most of them
aren't) whereas the value of "profile" always has to be an IRI.

&gt; While I like the idea per se, I don't think it's a good idea to repeat the "mistake" of XML to use HTTP URIs for things that are not supposed to be dereferenced. Why do you? Either create a new URI scheme for that or provide some useful information - e.g. a HTML page describing the profile or just a page linking to the profile's description.

i don't think that a new URI scheme would be appropriate, since i am not 
proposing a new way of interacting with resources. and for the work we 
are doing, we will in fact try to make sure that all profile URIs 
resolve to something useful, but that's optional. if you're confident 
that you don't want to serve anything, then you're free to identify you 
profile by a non-resolvable URI such as some URN (or, as i used to joke 
with XML namespace URIs, use a tel: URI and then people can call you 
when they have questions about the namespace), but that's your decision 
and not something the general mechanism should prescribe.

<pre>hello markus.

&gt; I agree. That's why I talked about *HTTP* URIs and using a different scheme
&gt; for non-dereferenceable ones. The I-D should be clear about that. That's all
&gt; I wanted to say..

the I-D should be clear about what? the I-D is clear about the fact that 
making the profile URI dereferencable is optional, but that's a question 
of the link relation type semantics, and not of the URI scheme of the 
linked resource. it's too bad that the I-D submission window is 
currently closed, but maybe i will just publish version -00 on my site 
so that we can start discussing specific issues. give me an hour or two.

&gt; It's no "mistake". It might be a matter of taste.

so let's assume you don't like it (like markus). what would be an option 
to avoid this? prescribing non-dereferencable URIs by saying a profile 
MUST be identified by a URN? large parts of the goodness of the web are 
based on the fact that by identifying a resource, in most cases you also 
have a way of accessing it through a uniform interface.

i am a little bit confused by what you're saying.

- a *link relation type value* either is a registered name (which is 
what i am trying to do for 'profile'), or it has to be a URI, at least 
this is what RFC 5988 defines. http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4

- the *target of any link* has to be a URI or IRI, based on the context 
of where the link appears. there is nothing any link relation type can 
change about this, this is how links work on the web.

could you please clarify what you mean by the above statement?

thanks and cheers,

dret.

In the "Security" section, "truly believed" seems out of place.  Maybe
something more objective:

"The 'profile' relation type is not known to introduce any new
security issues not already discussed in RFC 5988 [1] for generic use
of Web linking mechanism. "

that's a good point, it's a bad case of copy/paste from another link

In the IANA considerations it probably should read, as most registration
RFCs do.

from:

Reference: RFC xxxx (this draft's eventual RFC number)

to

Great. Would be interested in hearing more about it :-)


&gt; if you're confident

Fully agree and that's what I meant by make it clear in the I-D. As I've seen, you did that already.

I think the draft would benefit from a couple of examples..

Subject:Does the client contribute to the RESTfulness of an application?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>HI all

One topic that keeps coming up in my recent conversations is about the
scope of REST and whether it applies both to client and server i.e. is the
application the server, or is it the combination of client and server? Yes
definitely REST is a client-server architectural style...

Assume I have implemented my server in a RESTful way i.e. it adheres to all
the constraints / is hypermedia driven.


   - If I have no clients actively consuming me can I say the application
   is RESTful? i.e. is the RESTfulness determined by the server.
   - Is each client + server combination considered an application?
      - If I have two clients, one which consumes my application using
      hypermedia and other that doesn't / hardcodes dependencies on my
URIs then
      is the entire application non-RESTful?
      - Or, is it that really there are multiple applications (client1 +
      server, client2 + server) with one being RESTful the other not.
      - Are there actually three applications? one the server app, and the
      other two composites of client and server?


Interested in your thoughts and this is not a leading question :-)

If I have no clients actively consuming me can I say the application is 
RESTful? i.e. is the RESTfulness determined by the server. 
&lt;/snip&gt;
If you create a painting in the Cubist style and no one but you sees it, is 
it still Cubist?

"application"
"client"
"server"
"composites"
this is all really vague, IMO. ripe for trouble&lt;g&gt;.

here's how i see it:
- i implement a service in a REST-[like|ful|ish] style. done.
- anyone can implement a client that uses that service. it's up to them to 
decide what "style" they want to use for their implementation.

if someone implements a client app that hardcodes URIs and workflow and 
ignores the affordance details I supply from the service, that does not 
"diminish" the "REST-itude" of my efforts.

that's me.

well said. as illustration, imagine the many ways in which browsers can be broken and sometimes are. such as not making @src links on q/blockquote elements navigable. or firefox' recent decision to not display anymore that a page has associated feeds. all cases where no matter how you publish your data, poorly implemented clients can diminish its usefulness.

first, i'm not sure that is a "counter view" of what i said. IOW, how
does this run "counter" to my POV?

second, the term "application" can be applied lots of ways.
- a single component running on a singe machine,
- a group of components running on a single machine
- a group of machines running components
- etc.

finally, what is the "end game" here? IOW, why pursue this line of

nothing fixed yet, but essentially a profile description should define 
how it is specializing a media type, so we may create some (fairly 
loose) schema for how to capture documentation about this. nothing 
that's strictly a machine-readable schema, though, i would assume, and 
probably just for the kinds of profiles we're interested in.

good point, but are there any existing profile URIs i could use without 
having to make them up? i like the podcast example, but there is no 
profile URI for them (and sadly, they don't even use atom...).

thanks for the feedback! cheers,

Ok so let's move away from 'application' and talk about a 'system'..
 client behaviour has a direct impact on the nature of interactions in your
system and therefore the extents to which it can evolve. So if your clients
consume your service in a way "that hardcodes URIs and workflow and ignores
the affordance details I supply from the service", this will absolutely
have an impact on the "REST-itude" of your system since it is an emergence
of interaction in your system which directly violates the hypertext
constraint.

As a service provider, you can govern your clients through deliberate
designs that constrain their behaviour and that will help ensure they 'do
the right thing' - if you don't manage to do this and your clients do the
wrong thing then I think that does diminish the quality of your effort.

Hi Mike, Mike and Glenn.
This is my humble take:
1. Application is far more that just a component. My definition includes business goals and the like, so I won't enter there.

2. A system includes not only the components but the inter-relationships, interfaces and externally visible properties. As I once stated in this forum, a client is a role, and can be played by one component inside a system A, and by another system B consuming services on System A. So we can have a system of systems, where their components can be playing different roles, one of them being a client.

3. That clarified, REST is an architectural style that defines component roles and rules of engagement to achieve a set of quality properties. Theory says that one component not playing the role or not following the rules, may affect the property quality achievement. Clear?

4. Now, in any modern architecture development, we architects should not focus only in functional requirements, but in quality properties too. That means making decisions about how things are going to work, stating policies and making sure those policies are enforced. Following this line of thinking, implementing an architectural conception that follows REST style, but that does not enforce the rules or does not even detect a rule is being broken (a governance problem), I should say it is a weak implementation. And if we are not in control of all components (other people creating their services and clients) then we may not achieve the quality properties after all.

5. But all that is not REST fault, and shouldn't care less. That is the work of the architect, designers and developers and other stakeholders. REST is not an out-of-the-box solution you get when you install a framework and use it. A framework may help, but the actual success of delivering business value comes from the work of all people. You will get nowhere if a bunch of your developers keep not following the rules. If an external "client" enters the system, and is not playing the rules, may affect the quality properties, and sure it will suffer itself from that, when the server changes the uri namespace or the flow, then it becomes a problem of the spoiled client. 

My two cents.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Does the client contribute to the RESTfulness of an application?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>As Mike says, and part of generic matra REST for me is that a bad client
does not invalidate a good REST design. By the nature of REST, many of the
aspects of the architecture are in fact designed to benefit the client. And
other aspects simply cannot be counted on by the server in the wild anyway.

The HATEOS is a client advantage. If a client cares about the robustness of
their implementation, they will leverage HATEOS in order to help keep their
systems running without interruption. Many applications that offer HATEOS,
don't per se take advantage of it right off as it's mostly a future
proofing mechanism. You have simple apps on a single machine with a few,
solid services that will "never change" vs an app that is an aggressive
user of HATEOS, and pretty much forces a client to leverage as well (i.e.
no URL will ever be the same kind of thing). Those are opposite extremes.
Most fall in the former sense, they're just easier to design and manage
unless you have a very compelling reason to do otherwise.

So, you can see how a "dumb" client can easily get by with the first type
of application, but fail miserably with the latter.

Caches are another important aspect of the architecture that the system may
or may not be able to leverage. If your system implements their own caches,
then you can expect to see a benefit and plan around it. At this point a
bad client (i.e. one the completely ignores the caching constraints) can
put an excessive load on your core system. They're still a REST client, in
fact they can be an external cache themselves (perhaps a badly configured
one).

Now, if you're not providing you own caching layer, and effectively hoping
to leverage external caches, then you have no room to complain when you get
several clients that perhaps ignore the caching aspect. When you're relying
on external systems that you have no control over, you're on the borderline
of "serendipitous reuse". The bright side of SU is the new value it can
provide, the down side is the "serendipitous" part.

And finally, you can address the serendipitous reuse aspect. That too, is a
benefit of the client. It lets someone use the data in ways not envisioned
by the application designers. Thus providing added value to the client
Whether it's added value to the application is a different issue (maybe you
didn't want or plan for all of this new traffic, then again maybe you're
excited to be offering new value that you didn't have to code and design).

So, yes, it takes good corporation between the clients and the servers to
get the highest level of benefits from the architecture, but the simple
truth is much of the design is really there for the clients in the first
place and they're only hurting themselves in the long run by not playing
along.

<pre>There are strategies you can use within a system that mitigate the risk of
poor client consumption.

For example; your testing and/or sandbox environment can intentionally
obfuscate all of the URIs - which will help to weed out client which are
constructing URIs.

<pre>Hi Mikes &amp; All,

IMHO the RESTfulness is a property of the published services and, as it was
already said, it can't be affected by the clients.

On the other hand,
    application = client + server
(at least), where the clients can exhibit diverse levels of compliance with
HATEOAS or whatever.

So, back to the first MIke's first question, I doubt that the RESTfulness
could be said of the whole application combo; it only pertains to the back
end.

&gt; No, the server has just as much to gain from hypertext, as it will have a

&gt;

The parts that suffer from server change are the clients. Clearly, the
server is better utilized when clients perform properly, and clearly, when
the server makes changes that the the clients don't recognize (and thus
break), the server support team ends up eating the phone calls.

But in the end, the clients are the ones consuming the services. They're
consuming these services for their own advantage, so while HATEOS makes the
relationship between the server and client more manageable, in the end,
it's the clients the win by leverage HATEOS moreso than the server. Who
wants to make those phone calls to the server team in the first place?

<pre>Will, I completely agree with your thoughts about the client and the validation of the REST design, at least of what I understand. My point a subtlety different. Anyway, I understand REST was designed to meet some quality properties that were needed, and the benefits of the client are just collateral damage due to its role of service consumer and display agent (yes, it says so in the dissertation).

An architectural style is not a complete definition of the architecture, but just the ideas to achieve quality attributes. 

I often say to my students that a system can implement perfectly all the functional requirements, and meet all the quality property standards required, but if it does not deliver business value, it is a failure.

In the same sense, just one level down: The good REST design badge is achieved by implementing the REST constrains in your part of the system. But that badge will not assure the REST qualities are achieved in the whole system, or even in the system of systems above. 
Even more: having a completely perfect REST design and execution at all components, doesn't mean the app will give the business value and as such be a success. It may also fail.

So, to answer the original question, and a couple more I answered without being questioned:
1. Does the client contribute to the RESTfulness of an application? Yes if the client is part of the application. It will not invalidate the RESTFulness of the server, but it may do so for the whole system.

2. Does designing an app server side to be compliant with REST rules delivers the goals of REST. Not necessarily, we need a compliant client and complaint interim layers (yup, REST is a layered architecture).

3. Does having a fully compliant REST architecture implemented is enough to be a success. No, it isn't. 

Those were the points I wanted to share.

I agree with everything you said. The true benefits of REST are only
realized if both client and server understand the constraints. However the
fact some clients may not adhere to those constraints is orthagonal to the
server. However system is at many levels. Each combination of client and
server is a system itself.

The one thing that is very clear is that the server is the gate. If the
server doesn't adhere to the constraints then all the "macro" level systems
are not RESTful.

My point in all of this was to reach a better understanding of where the
RESTFulness of a system is defined / exhibited and what defines the
boundaries of the system.

My point in all of this was to reach a better understanding of where the
RESTFulness of a system is defined / exhibited and what defines the

&lt;/snip&gt;

I think it's important to consider whether "a system" has more than one
"server" in it and whether that "system" could be judged as a "REST system"
only if all the machines acting in a "server role" sufficiently exhibited
the "REST style." This is particularly challenging when you consider that
any machine in "the system" can adopt the "client" or "server" role at any
time.

<pre>Hey, Mike.
You just multiplied the exponent of the complexity by 2.

A system is a set of components. An architectural style defines the structure, roles and rules that will govern those components. They are very clear in REST.

Actually, I feel REST does not constrain the roles of the components in a system, it simply defines the roles it requires and how will they interact. There may be other components not following the roles or rules that may work in the system too. Problem is we need the interaction rules between non-REST component and the true REST ones. Allowing alien components in the system is the architect's responsibility and should be done with complete rationale and knowledge of the impact in the quality properties we need to achieve. A golden rule in architecture is you can break the rules if it is needed to obtain the business value. 
That means, we can accept non-REST servers in our system if we provide a way to communicate them with our REST-complaint ones without affecting that much what we are looking for. That may not make the REST-like architecture less RESTfull, in my opinion.

&gt; &gt; In the same sense, just one level down: The good REST design badge is
&gt; &gt; achieved by implementing the REST constrains in your part of the system.
&gt; &gt; But that badge will not assure the REST qualities are achieved in the whole
&gt; &gt; system, or even in the system of systems above.
&gt; &gt; Even more: having a completely perfect REST design and execution at all
&gt; &gt; components, doesn't mean the app will give the business value and as such
&gt; &gt; be a success. It may also fail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, to answer the original question, and a couple more I answered without
&gt; &gt; being questioned:
&gt; &gt; 1. Does the client contribute to the RESTfulness of an application? Yes if
&gt; &gt; the client is part of the application. It will not invalidate the
&gt; &gt; RESTFulness of the server, but it may do so for the whole system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Does designing an app server side to be compliant with REST rules
&gt; &gt; delivers the goals of REST. Not necessarily, we need a compliant client and
&gt; &gt; complaint interim layers (yup, REST is a layered architecture).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. Does having a fully compliant REST architecture implemented is enough
&gt; &gt; to be a success. No, it isn't.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those were the points I wanted to share.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; &gt; As Mike says, and part of generic matra REST for me is that a bad client
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not invalidate a good REST design. By the nature of REST, many of
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspects of the architecture are in fact designed to benefit the client.
&gt; &gt; And
&gt; &gt; &gt; other aspects simply cannot be counted on by the server in the wild
&gt; &gt; anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The HATEOS is a client advantage. If a client cares about the robustness
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; their implementation, they will leverage HATEOS in order to help keep
&gt; &gt; their
&gt; &gt; &gt; systems running without interruption. Many applications that offer
&gt; &gt; HATEOS,
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't per se take advantage of it right off as it's mostly a future
&gt; &gt; &gt; proofing mechanism. You have simple apps on a single machine with a few,
&gt; &gt; &gt; solid services that will "never change" vs an app that is an aggressive
&gt; &gt; &gt; user of HATEOS, and pretty much forces a client to leverage as well (i.e.
&gt; &gt; &gt; no URL will ever be the same kind of thing). Those are opposite extremes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most fall in the former sense, they're just easier to design and manage
&gt; &gt; &gt; unless you have a very compelling reason to do otherwise.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you can see how a "dumb" client can easily get by with the first type
&gt; &gt; &gt; of application, but fail miserably with the latter.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Caches are another important aspect of the architecture that the system
&gt; &gt; may
&gt; &gt; &gt; or may not be able to leverage. If your system implements their own
&gt; &gt; caches,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then you can expect to see a benefit and plan around it. At this point a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad client (i.e. one the completely ignores the caching constraints) can
&gt; &gt; &gt; put an excessive load on your core system. They're still a REST client,
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact they can be an external cache themselves (perhaps a badly configured
&gt; &gt; &gt; one).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, if you're not providing you own caching layer, and effectively
&gt; &gt; hoping
&gt; &gt; &gt; to leverage external caches, then you have no room to complain when you
&gt; &gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; several clients that perhaps ignore the caching aspect. When you're
&gt; &gt; relying
&gt; &gt; &gt; on external systems that you have no control over, you're on the
&gt; &gt; borderline
&gt; &gt; &gt; of "serendipitous reuse". The bright side of SU is the new value it can
&gt; &gt; &gt; provide, the down side is the "serendipitous" part.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, you can address the serendipitous reuse aspect. That too,
&gt; &gt; is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefit of the client. It lets someone use the data in ways not
&gt; &gt; envisioned
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the application designers. Thus providing added value to the client
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether it's added value to the application is a different issue (maybe
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't want or plan for all of this new traffic, then again maybe you're
&gt; &gt; &gt; excited to be offering new value that you didn't have to code and
&gt; &gt; design).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, yes, it takes good corporation between the clients and the servers to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get the highest level of benefits from the architecture, but the simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; truth is much of the design is really there for the clients in the first
&gt; &gt; &gt; place and they're only hurting themselves in the long run by not playing
&gt; &gt; &gt; along.

<pre>I am working on a project that is attempting to implement a RESTful service layer (including HATEOAS) for a customer facing web application/portal (followed by other applications and integrations leveraging said service layer). We are looking for some professional consulting to review our approach and provide us some guidance on the architecture and implementation.

I thought I might be worth reaching out to this group to see if anyone could point me in the right direction for qualified -expert- REST consulting.

We are progressing fairly well in our implementation, but unfortunately we are by no means REST (implementation) experts, so we definitely could benefit from the advice of someone/someones who has "been there, and done that".

Yes. I often tell people "Just because your RESTful APIs aren't really
RESTful doesn't mean I don't like working with them. It's still WAAAAY
better than SOAP or something random."

I _do_ think that if you don't have all of the constraints, you are no
longer RESTful. You might have a great system. It might solve your
problems well. But it's not RESTful. I'd argue that the status of
'code-on-demand' implies that all of the other constraints are
required. Fielding also describes them in a way that implies to me
that they're all required.

&gt; REST consists of a set of architectural constraints chosen for the properties they induce on candidate architectures.

i agree with this, but depending on how you as the service provider 
inform and support your clients, they might tend to use the service in a 
better or in a worse way. for example, if you document all the URI 
patterns you are currently exposing, just FYI and with giant note 
advising consumers not not hardcode those patterns, clients will still 
do that, and when they break, they will very loudly complain that your 
change broke them. it didn't, but you will still have to deal with 
broken clients and unhappy customers. so apart from the design and your 
ability to design things well, i think it also is very important to make 
sure that clients understand what you're doing, and use the affordances 
(this one is for you, mike ;-) you provide them, instead of hacking 
around your actual model. i think an excellent way of doing this is to 
always expose a browsable HTML version, even if it is very primitive and 
has no UI design to it at all. ideally, just provide an XSLT and link 
that to your XML API representations, so that browsers supporting 
client-side transforms will allow developers to surf the API and 
understand the way in which it is supposed to be used.

cheers,

dret.

<pre>Correct!

A component with a REST Badge will not make the whole system to earn its own badge. 

If the discussion is about naming or achieving a badge, then I guess it is very subjective.

If the discussion is about the impact of having those hybrid systems, and how different is the impact depending on which component is the one that is not complaint, then it is clear that we need to analyze case by case. And there is where clarifications like "what is a client?", an internal client, a server in the client role, an external client of a system; and also that app != system != server != API, become important. My views are related to Systems, not apps, services or APIs.

Cheers.

William.

<pre>My point was that this is not a contest of who can earn the REST badge. The
question I am seeking clarification on is whether or not the RESTfulness of
a system is confined to the server or not / what defines the scope of the
system.

My understanding up until now is that REST really is confined to how the
server is implemented and does not directly include the client However I am
questioning that understanding. The discertation clearly speaks about both
client and server components.

So my only goal is to get more understanding. The result can impact how I
speak/educate about REST and also how I build RESTful systems. For example
as Mike mentioned, you can create opaque uris to prevent the client from
coupling to the uri space.

<pre>This discussion helped me understand that ...

   - RESTful is the service, not the system, and
   - the client can leverage such restfulness at varying levels (sometimes
   conditioned by circumstances).

The proof , in one gedanken experiment, is that one could implement equal
clients (from the user's standpoint) with totally different backends.
As I'm an IxD guy (but with a many year development background), my vision
might be different.

You see all the build-transitions in one slide,but I still hope you get the idea. It is, BTW, an aspect of Roy's work and the work he builds upon) I only understood years down the line. Reading those sections of the dissertation *very* carefully is quite rewarding - at least it was for me.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Fine then, Glenn, here it is plain answer:

a. Yes if you define RESTFulness as a badge that certifies you follow the rules. Yes, you can earn that badge only in your server and forget about the client.

b. NO, if you define RESTFulness as the achievement of the expected quality properties you seek for when using REST. And that NO is because the rules are made to achieve a way of interaction between the components, and one of those components is the client. 

In other words, client matters.

As I had been posting here, one component may not behave by the rules, but if that is free license the architect is aware of and it is reasonable so that the impact will not break the business goals, that is fine. But if you need a system where clients behave correctly, and you don't control the clients, then your architecture must have controls and policy enforcement to avoid those spoiled clients from ruining you day. If not, your system will not get to its goal and it will be a failure, even if your server is made by the REST book. 

REST stops when it defines the constrains and promises quality properties, but life goes on, and the rest of the system is still to be constructed. Having just one server following REST rules is just one step. And let me clarify this: It should not be part of the server's job to assure the client is working as it should. It may help, but we can have several layers that can add controls and enforce policies. There is far more in an system than just one server and one client.

Finally: I feel the discussion confuses an App, with a Server, with a System, with a API. When we talk about a server doing its part, sounds like we are talking about an API. Is it that? Yes, we can expose a REST like API, but then we need a client to consume it. A system is something far more complex, where all components, including clients, may affect other components. Butterfly effect, that is called.

Well, this was not a short and sweet answer, and I feel I'm repeating myself here. But it is truly a more deep discussion than just earning a badge.

Cheers

William.

If am reading the deck properly you are saying the application includes the
client / server components, the client is not separate. Is that correct?

Yes, the *user agent* ('client' is the term for the connector, not the component) is just another component of the application that realizes some use case.

There is conceptually no difference between a monolithic application and a networked application. It is just that in the latter the components reside on different hosts (e.g. your PC and Amazon's server host).

Note how the configuration of the app is different! A monolithic application is configured (assembled) at compile time, a unix commandline is configured when you type it (search for 'invisible hand' in the dissertation) and an HTTP (browser based) application is configured when you type the URI(s) in your browser window(s).

Not browser-based HTTP applications are configured when the user agent component (e.g. the crawler that checks some online shops) is configured with its start URIs.

<pre>Thanks for the explanation William.

Here's my tough take aways on this convo:

   - A RESTful system has a shared set of responsibilities between client
   and server. To truly realize the benefits of REST both client and server
   have to be good citizens.
   - The server is the critical path. It's responsibility is to expose
   resources in a manner that is consistent with adhering to the constraints.
   That means it sticks to the uniform interface (headers, media types),
   supports caching, uses hypermedia etc.
   - The client must also adhere to REST constraints. If it does not, then
   the overall benefits of REST are not achieved within that system. It's
   responsibility is to consume resources in a RESTful manner, i.e. use the
   uniform interface, consumes hypermedia, obeys caching requirements, etc.
   - A client not obeying the rules does not necessarily remove all
   benefits of REST for the server, though it can if it is the ONLY client.
   - Not enough emphasis is put on this division of responsibilities when
   talking about REST.

Thoughts?

Thanks
Glenn

&gt;&gt; &gt; Then why ask if such a system is RESTful? Your question is a more
&gt;&gt; general
&gt;&gt; &gt; systems and architecture question, I guess. Which is 100% valid, but the
&gt;&gt; &gt; form of the question doesn't reflect what you were actually asking, I
&gt;&gt; guess.

&gt; Not browser-based HTTP applications are configured when the user agent component (e.g. the crawler that checks some online shops) is configured with its start URIs.

general developers speak about client they mean the user agent i.e.
Silverlight client, Flash client, web client etc. I was using it in that
sens.

<pre>"A client not obeying the rules does not necessarily remove all benefits of

The more i think about this, the more I realize that is probably not
entirely true. The client not being RESTful can remove some benefits but
not all. For example as long as the server implements GET in an
idemponent/safe manner then that means the response can safely be cached.
Nothing the client does can prevent that fact.

However, if the client couples to the uri space rather than following
hypermedia AND it is the only client, or it is one of the predominantly
used clients then it can impact the ability of the server to evolve as if
the server changes the uri scheme, a significant set of users are shut out
until the client is updated.

&gt; Thanks for the explanation William.
&gt;
&gt; Here's my tough take aways on this convo:
&gt;
&gt;    - A RESTful system has a shared set of responsibilities between client
&gt;    and server. To truly realize the benefits of REST both client and server
&gt;    have to be good citizens.
&gt;    - The server is the critical path. It's responsibility is to expose
&gt;    resources in a manner that is consistent with adhering to the constraints.
&gt;    That means it sticks to the uniform interface (headers, media types),
&gt;    supports caching, uses hypermedia etc.
&gt;    - The client must also adhere to REST constraints. If it does not,
&gt;    then the overall benefits of REST are not achieved within that system. It's
&gt;    responsibility is to consume resources in a RESTful manner, i.e. use the
&gt;    uniform interface, consumes hypermedia, obeys caching requirements, etc.
&gt;    - A client not obeying the rules does not necessarily remove all
&gt;    benefits of REST for the server, though it can if it is the ONLY client.
&gt;    - Not enough emphasis is put on this division of responsibilities when
&gt;    talking about REST.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Fine then, Glenn, here it is plain answer:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a. Yes if you define RESTFulness as a badge that certifies you follow the
&gt;&gt; rules. Yes, you can earn that badge only in your server and forget about
&gt;&gt; the client.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; b. NO, if you define RESTFulness as the achievement of the expected
&gt;&gt; quality properties you seek for when using REST. And that NO is because the
&gt;&gt; rules are made to achieve a way of interaction between the components, and
&gt;&gt; one of those components is the client.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In other words, client matters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I had been posting here, one component may not behave by the rules,
&gt;&gt; but if that is free license the architect is aware of and it is reasonable
&gt;&gt; so that the impact will not break the business goals, that is fine. But if
&gt;&gt; you need a system where clients behave correctly, and you don't control the
&gt;&gt; clients, then your architecture must have controls and policy enforcement
&gt;&gt; to avoid those spoiled clients from ruining you day. If not, your system
&gt;&gt; will not get to its goal and it will be a failure, even if your server is
&gt;&gt; made by the REST book.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; REST stops when it defines the constrains and promises quality
&gt;&gt; properties, but life goes on, and the rest of the system is still to be
&gt;&gt; constructed. Having just one server following REST rules is just one step.
&gt;&gt; And let me clarify this: It should not be part of the server's job to
&gt;&gt; assure the client is working as it should. It may help, but we can have
&gt;&gt; several layers that can add controls and enforce policies. There is far
&gt;&gt; more in an system than just one server and one client.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally: I feel the discussion confuses an App, with a Server, with a
&gt;&gt; System, with a API. When we talk about a server doing its part, sounds like
&gt;&gt; we are talking about an API. Is it that? Yes, we can expose a REST like
&gt;&gt; API, but then we need a client to consume it. A system is something far
&gt;&gt; more complex, where all components, including clients, may affect other
&gt;&gt; components. Butterfly effect, that is called.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, this was not a short and sweet answer, and I feel I'm repeating
&gt;&gt; myself here. But it is truly a more deep discussion than just earning a
&gt;&gt; badge.
&gt;&gt;

<pre>Glenn, totally agree with the point, nice summary!
And about the last part, any non-complaint component will affect the goals depending on what is the constrain it is not adhering to, what component that is, how many relationships it has with other components, etc. In other words, there are not absolutes here, everything depends and it is the job of the architect to know how much impact one little change means.

Cheers!

I don't get this. For example, if I had a fully RESTful server publishing a

Would the service be deprived of it's badge?
Of course it won't!

IMO this thread is so lengthy because it started with a "RESTful system"

The client can't be RESTful, as it does not communicate with its (human

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Sorry Juan, but the very last sentence you said, IMHO, is not that correct.

One thing is the REST badge = Complaint of all constrains.
Another one is the quality of the system/service. If you have components that do not play by the rules, you loose what the rules were intended for, and thus the quality of service suffers. If the service is good or bad, well used or not, that impacts the system somehow. So, a misbehaving client should be taken seriously into account, even if it doesn't take your badge away. 

To me, the REST certificate is useless beyond marketing and selling points. It will not give much if the architecture is not controlled and governed as it should.

Finally, and to be fair that is my line of thinking "out of the bun", I have a presentation of a talk I gave at the SOA and Cloud Symposium, Brazil, where I explained why a RESTful service may come with a little of impedance mismatch, and as such is not suitable for many business cases. In that sense, the service may have its implementation in perfect REST, with a perfect client, and still the quality may be poor.

Maybe the main point here is not the badge thing, but agreeing that there are concerns that are deeper and far more important that the actual badge itself. What do you think?

Juan, Glenn.
I think you are actually in two different pages.
Juan is talking about the REST certificate, and the actual quality of the service from the server point of view. 
Glenn is talking, as Juan correctly notes, about the quality of the system. 
Both may be right. 
The only thing I disagree is with Juan's notion of service quality. To me, for the service to be great, it has to assure the correct use and handle bad use, as clients are on the wild out there. Working great only with nice behaving clients and blaming bad clients does not mean good quality for me. But that said, it is my POV.

<pre> I'd argue that if a client doesn't follow the usage that is provided by a service, then they ought to be aware of the cost of doing so in the future. It has no impact whatsoever on the quality of the system per se if clients chose to bypass the contract defined in a media type.

In B2B we'd make compliance part of the SLA.

&gt; What about the counter view that each client and server combo is the 'application'

first, i'm not sure that is a "counter view" of what i said. IOW, how
does this run "counter" to my POV?

second, the term "application" can be applied lots of ways.
- a single component running on a singe machine,
- a group of components running on a single machine
- a group of machines running components
- etc.

finally, what is the "end game" here? IOW, why pursue this line of
convo? what positive things can result?



Ok so let's move away from 'application' and talk about a 'system'..  client behaviour has a direct impact on the nature of interactions in your system and therefore the extents to which it can evolve. So if your clients consume your service in a way "that hardcodes URIs and workflow and ignores the affordance details I supply from the service", this will absolutely have an impact on the "REST-itude" of your system since it is an emergence of interaction in your system which directly violates the hypertext constraint.

As a service provider, you can govern your clients through deliberate designs that constrain their behaviour and that will help ensure they 'do the right thing' - if you don't manage to do this and your clients do the wrong thing then I think that does diminish the quality of your effort.

Cheers,
Mike

<pre>Seems we are all starting to agree.

As of my POV on the client, two points:

   - it doesn't inpact the RESTfulness of the service, and
   - bad clients make bad systems (the aggregate) despite the quality og
   the server: the chain is as strong as its eweakest link.

In fact, I'm a client guy. I understand that a RESTful backend is the best
way known to decouple front-end development from back-end development.
REST sets a set of clear and crisp rules on how to build the services
disregarding the specifics of the client's design.
This is a VERY GOOD thing. Decoupling is good because it slashes system
complexity at the exponent level.
This allows a team to design a really usable UI (this is my area of
knowledge) using for example HTML5 and jQuery (any other technology would
do) and let the client tell its services needs.
The client designer must be aware of the REST way of doing things, as it
came out from this thread. The good news is that REST is easy to teach and
understand.

Subject:Rel attributes?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm currently embarking on a question to fully understand REST so i can move my company towards architectural independence :). Once we design the back end (service) we will be able to just any device we want to communicate with our systems (IPAD,IPhone,Android,WPF,ect...)

I'm currently reading "REST In Practice" by Oreilly. I'm sure a lot in this group have read the book. I just finished chapter 5 "Hypermedia Services" which is arguably one of the most important and most difficult concepts to understand with REST. I found myself getting lost while reading the chapter but i kept reading hoping by the time i got to the end everything would make sense. Well everything doesn't. Some concepts are still really really fuzzy. I'm going to reread the chapter and post questions as i start to get confused (there probably will be quite a few).

I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact with the link provider). The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look like. For example the link:
&lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
      href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;

If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web browser what would you see?

&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact with the link provider).

The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.

If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation, then that is even better.

There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it sees your link rel value.

&lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to have it do something with it.

IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is programmed (or configured) to do.

No magic.

The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.

REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).

HTH,

Typically, an HTTP 404 error message. 
The values of such rel attributes do not need to be dereferencable. They are used as mere names for identifying the nature of the link. 
For added fun, you can optionally make them dereferencable, providing for instance a human readable documentation about the semantic of that particular type of link, or whatever suits you, but this isn't required.

  Subject: [rest-discuss] Rel attributes?


    
  I'm currently embarking on a question to fully understand REST so i can move my company towards architectural independence :). Once we design the back end (service) we will be able to just any device we want to communicate with our systems (IPAD,IPhone,Android,WPF,ect...)

  I'm currently reading "REST In Practice" by Oreilly. I'm sure a lot in this group have read the book. I just finished chapter 5 "Hypermedia Services" which is arguably one of the most important and most difficult concepts to understand with REST. I found myself getting lost while reading the chapter but i kept reading hoping by the time i got to the end everything would make sense. Well everything doesn't. Some concepts are still really really fuzzy. I'm going to reread the chapter and post questions as i start to get confused (there probably will be quite a few).

  I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact with the link provider). The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look like. For example the link:
  &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
  href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;

  If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web browser what would you see? 

  thanks...

just to make that crystal clear: *automatically dereferencing them* 
every time you encounter such a URI is discouraged, and it would be a 
pretty bad idea because they are primarily identifiers, not references. 
but *making them dereferencerable* and providing useful information 
(links to spec, examples, code, products, contact info) is actually a 
good idea. and if you set caching parameters right on that info, then 
even bad implementations should mainly create load for intermediaries, 
and not necessarily for the origin server.

cheers,

Subject:Re: Rel attributes?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi nikonguy74!
Just to complement what Jan is saying:
1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...

2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that link will get you to the next page of the book. 

3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad practice.

4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically programmed, but it will need intelligence.

5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With that info you can program intelligent clients.

6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world knows it.  So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute will tell you everything.

Cheers

William Martinez.

&gt; 
&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt; 
&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation, then that is even better.
&gt; 
&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it sees your link rel value.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to have it do something with it.
&gt; 
&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt; 
&gt; No magic.
&gt; 
&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt; 
&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;

Subject:Is HTML5 cache a useless regression?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi folks,

might be wrong on this, that's why I ask it here.

Today I took a look at HTML5 cache for offline browsing and
prefetching resources:
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/

What's your opinion about that? Am I assuming correctly - if you use
the manifest you drop support for the original HTTP cache spec[1]?

"Once an application is offline it remains cached until one of the
following happens:

1. The user clears their browser's data storage for your site.
2. The manifest file is modified. Note: updating a file listed in the
manifest doesn't mean the browser will re-cache that resource. The
manifest file itself must be alternated."

Given this, I don't see the point of HTML5 cache.
Please open my eyes :)

You don't drop support but you basically override it. That's completely fine
for a client to do. If you download a file you also "cache" it forever on
your hard disk.

You can run the application offline :-) That (and the increased performance)
is the whole point of it. If you want to update certain parts of your
application you normally change that resources IRI which forces the client
to download it. This is similar to nowadays best practice of caching, e.g.,
your CSS files for a very long time. If you need to change them, you would
have to change their IRI and reference the new ones from your website.


Hope this helps,
Markus

Subject:Alternate media types for different methods?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>We're coming up with a relatively common problem in our API where we
define a media type then need to make different parts of it optional
for GET (remove references that are not valid to allow HATEOAS) and
POST (leave out parts of the media type that are filled in by the
server when creating a new resource).

Rather than defining all of the attributes as optional (which often
makes most of the media type optional) and requiring clients and
servers to check for the existence of many attributes, it seems better
to instead define vnd.mycorp.myapp.Widget (used for GET and PUT) and
vnd.mycorp.myapp.NewWidget (used for POST) as separate media types
which make different parts of the representation optional.

This seems like the most RESTful/HTTP friendly way to solve the
problem, does anyone see any problems with it (other than it creating
lots of similar media types)?

Cheers,

Jim

Subject:Media-type for simple key/value store?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>A part of my current project is management of simple key/value properties (string/string) for (more or less) any resource in the system.

My use-cases/scenarios are:

1) Some resource in the system contains a link with the rel-type "additional-properties". This link points to the list of additional properties for that resource (at the URL "{additional-properties}").

2) The URL "{additional-properties}" returns a list of key/value properties for reading.

3) For each key/value in the list there will be links for a) editing the value of the key, and 2) deleting the key.

3a) Editing is as simple as PUTing a new value to the URL.

3b) Deleting a key is as simple as a HTTP DELETE of the URL.

4) The list also contains a link for adding new properties.

What would be a suitable (simple) media-type for this?

I am considering ATOM (which is nice for lists), but that seems like quite a bit of overkill. HTML might also be useful (but does not support PUT, but POST would be okay too). A home-grown application/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility.

What would you guys do?

Atom is for feeds, and HTML is for layout markup. You need something
designed for transactional entities. Shoji [1] is a JSON-based protocol
and media type designed for that, and it includes entity collections
("catalogs") as a bonus. Every Shoji Entity automatically includes the
concept of using PUT to edit each attribute at its own URL (the server
is free to return 405 for attributes where that method is not allowed).
DELETE is specified for Entities, not Values as you describe above, but
there's nothing stopping you from using DELETE that way.

Shoji even covers the concept of "additional properties" for you;
they're called "fragments" in Shoji.

Hi Markus,

but that's, basically, already doable with the existing caching spec,
right? It's just a browser limitation that doesn't allow you to surf a
resource which could be cached (let's say Cache-Control: public,
max-age=84600), right?

I only see a basic advantage on using it for static content (assets,
CSSes and so on), using the version in the querystring, as you
mentioned.

&gt; 3b) Deleting a key is as simple as a HTTP DELETE of the URL.
&gt;
&gt; 4) The list also contains a link for adding new properties.
&gt;
&gt; What would be a suitable (simple) media-type for this?
&gt;
&gt; I am considering ATOM (which is nice for lists), but that seems like quite a bit of overkill. HTML might also be useful (but does not support PUT, but POST would be okay too). A home-grown application/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility.
&gt;
&gt; What would you guys do?

&gt; We're coming up with a relatively common problem in our API where we

&gt; server when creating a new resource).
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than defining all of the attributes as optional (which often
&gt; makes most of the media type optional) and requiring clients and
&gt; servers to check for the existence of many attributes, it seems better
&gt; to instead define vnd.mycorp.myapp.Widget (used for GET and PUT) and
&gt; vnd.mycorp.myapp.NewWidget (used for POST) as separate media types
&gt; which make different parts of the representation optional.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems like the most RESTful/HTTP friendly way to solve the
&gt; problem, does anyone see any problems with it (other than it creating
&gt; lots of similar media types)?

I've found that simply partitioning off a section of the resource works
very well for this. In one of our JSON-based media types, the entity
looks something like:

{"self": "http://somewhere.example/things/123/",
 "parent": "/things/18/",
 "user": "/users/jimpurbrick/",
 "body": {
    "status": "active",
    "foo": "bar"
 }
} 

It's part of the API that everything in the "body" member is mutable on
update, while "parent", and "user" are only mutable on insert (and
"self" isn't mutable at all at that URI). The client can still send
"parent" and "user" members, and probably should if they're using PUT
instead of PATCH, but the server will replace those supplied values with
the existing ones to make the resource consistent with its internal
constraints.

It's different I would say. The app cache is really for applications. You
include all your app assets and code and then "install" it. It doesn't make
that much sense to have parts with different lifetimes in such a scenario
and the manifest is more or less just a way to create a package. It also
gives you APIs to check the state of your cache and so on..

How else would you achieve that in a browser? Since the browser doesn't know
what belongs together it would probably delete a huge JS file at some point
while still keeping the other stuff. This would break your app. So perhaps
think of it more in terms of an app than in terms of caching.

Isn't that how it is supposed to work as currently specified? As long as I

Yes, we need some way for servers and clients to negotiate storage
allocation for caching. My point was that the solution should be
designed so that it reuses stuff we already have, like stale-if-error.

Subject:Question on explicit link relations in REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Folks,

I've defined a read only API where links to other resources follow an Atom like model and include the media-type &amp; relation as well as the URI, so they look something like this in JSON:

links: [ { href: "/foo", type: "fooType", rel: "self" },
         { href: "/bar", type: "barType", rel: "http://example.com/customeRel" ]

In a conversation with someone who is not entirely into the whole REST thing they commented

"including the type &amp; relation in the link is extra complexity, if we did it in XML we could just figure that out implicitly from the schema when we GET the linked resource"

Leaving aside XML Vs JSON arguments (which aren't relevant to my question) I justified it with an argument that explicitly including the relation meant you didn't need to GET the resource to know what the relationship was (as the same type could have different relations to different resources, e.g. parent vs child relations) and including the type meant the client could know what it was going to GET without actually getting it - e.g. "I don't need to know about barTypes right now so I won't bother getting them until I need to know about them"

But afterwards I thought to myself while my arguments above seem reasonable there must be other good reasons (that I can't immediately think of) for being explicit with types &amp; relations in links in RESTful APIs.

Can you help me with your thoughts on what those other good reasons are?

Thanks
Ben

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Ben:

FWIW, I use {href:"...", rel:"..."} sufficient decoration for most all
cases (i.e. no "type" decoration). my clients are "coded to the rel"
and that's all.

Also, I am usually wary of people who say things like "we could just
figure that out implicitly" as this often introducing "coupling based
on assumption" that can limit future mods/enhancements down the line.

Finally, I don't use a "type" decoration since this leads my client
apps into expecting strongly-typed "objects" in the response
representation. I try to avoid this expectation. What clients get back
is a representation in the agree media type. Clients are then able to
process the representation using the media type rules and compute,
render, and when appropriate, activate the hypermedia in the response.
The "type" is not needed for those steps.

In your case, what is it that the "type" value is used for by the client apps?

Subject:Re: Media-type for simple key/value store?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Thanks for all the interesting inputs. I think I will go with the "fielding" properties approach - using x-www-form-urlencoded for the payload.

At first I though Mike was suggesting the client should be hard coded to know that it could add ";props" to all URLs, which is not exactly in line with his work on hypermedia APIs ...

Then I saw Fielding's comment: "Note that the entire URI prefix is determined by the origin server, so the properties might even be on a different server than the resource." and figured that the server has to supply the exact link. Much better :-)

So, for now it becomes:

1) Some resources in the system contains a link with the rel-type "additional-properties". This link points to the list of additional properties for that resource (at the URL "{additional-properties}").
 
2) The URL "{additional-properties}" returns a list of key/value properties for reading. That "list" is represented with x-www-form-urlencoded.

3) The whole set of properties for one resource can be updated by PUTing a set of values (using form-urlencoded again) to the "{additional-properties}" URL.

4) The whole set of properties for one resource can be delete by DELETing the "{additional-properties}" URL.

5) It is not possible to update a single key/value pair by itself. Neither is that required in out current use cases (which allows a user to edit the whole set of values at once).

Thanks, JÃ¸rn

&gt; &gt; 1) Some resource in the system contains a link with the rel-type "additional-properties". This link points to the list of additional properties for that resource (at the URL "{additional-properties}").
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) The URL "{additional-properties}" returns a list of key/value properties for reading.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) For each key/value in the list there will be links for a) editing the value of the key, and 2) deleting the key.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3a) Editing is as simple as PUTing a new value to the URL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3b) Deleting a key is as simple as a HTTP DELETE of the URL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) The list also contains a link for adding new properties.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What would be a suitable (simple) media-type for this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am considering ATOM (which is nice for lists), but that seems like quite a bit of overkill. HTML might also be useful (but does not support PUT, but POST would be okay too). A home-grown application/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What would you guys do?

Some simple questions that might lead to interesting discussions:

How far do you agree that REST and hypermedia are about following one’s nose?
Is the “following your nose” thing an essential part of REST?
And what is there more to REST than can be explained by “following your nose”?

All input welcome!

i think it's essential, it means that when you're exploring hyperlinked 
resources, both the links and the resources need to follow an agreed-on 
framework of self-description (link relation types and media types, on 
the web). anybody designing within that framework can create new link 
relations and/or media types, and clients navigating through that space 
have an easy way to understand that they follow paths with known 
semantics ("i know that link relation") or encounter resources with 
known semantics ("i know that media type").

what's important for a service provider in addition to that might be to 
give clients an understanding of the set of link relations and media 
types they might encounter for a "service web" at a given point in time. 
for example, thinking back to 10 years ago, how would you have 
communicated the fact that "the web" back then was mostly HTML, GIF, 
JPEG, RSS? today, you might add PNG and Atom to this list, and maybe 
feed paging.

our goal is to have a simple way of bundling these concepts (link 
relation types and media types) and communicating them to clients as a 
guide to what might happen when they follow their nose in the hypermedia 
space exposed by our services. "this is what you definitely should 
accept, and of course, you should always expect unknown things to show 
up as well", this is what we as service providers would like to be able 
to say, and in addition to that, they might even want to provide an 
actual map (a subset) of the resources they are serving, which would be 
the sitemap model. such a servicemap would pretty much point your nose 
at very many resources immediately, and you could either just be happy 
with those resources, or you might follow links from them to more 
resources. i think it is important to keep in mind that a sitemap, 
looked at as a resource, is a very RESTful thing in itself, it contains 
a (large) set of links, and clients can find such a map and use such a 
map purely by "follow your nose" principles.

cheers,

dret.

Subject:Building a web app/api<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm about to build a web app that should expose its functionality via API
and I'm trying to find the most effective way to do that and would like to
hear your thoughts on the topic.
The functionality of the 'website' and the API intersect, with API having
additional features that should not be available from the website (from
browser). A traditional approach to building such systems seems to be
building a website and an API as two separate projects, probably even using
different technologies. That seems ineffective as there are 2 places
(website and api) which have to invoke the same business logic with all the
joys as a result. For example, adding a feature that should be exposed in
both requires adding it to 2 places. Basically you should always think
about keeping your website and API in sync. Not fun.

And I don't want to have browsers and machine clients to work with the same
html as it can easily become too verbose.

Another way is to have the same set of resources that a browser and
programmatic clients communicate with and use content negotiation to either
return text/html (for browser) or application/vnd.whatever+json (for
programmatic clients). With this approach only the code that converts
resource objects to representations have to differ. I have a couple of
concerns with this approach as well:

   1. There are features that should be available via api only, meaning
   html representations may not have the same links available in json for the
   specific resource. I'm not sure this is correct as depending on which media
   type the client asks it may get completely different features. Feels kinda
   wrong, but is it?
   2. Earlier or later the two media types will start to diverge,
   specifically when we have to take care about evolvability of the 'machine'
   media type, while that is not a concern for 'humans' html. And here we go
   again  having to have different links between html and json representations.
   3. Browsers do only GET and POST. But that can be pretty easily
   overridden by X-HTTP-Method-Override to do PUT and DELETE.

What are your overall thoughts and experience on the topic?

Thanks,
Vitaly

just to avoid any confusion: these are semweb definitions of what as 
link and following a link means or should mean, and there is quite a 
difference between how links are conceptualized in REST and in semweb.

<pre>Hi Erik,

&gt; i think it's essential

Fully agree on that ;-)

&gt; it means that when you're exploring hyperlinked resources, both the links and the resources need to follow an agreed-on framework of self-description (link relation types and media types, on the web). anybody designing within that framework can create new link relations and/or media types, and clients navigating through that space have an easy way to understand that they follow paths with known semantics ("i know that link relation") or encounter resources with known semantics ("i know that media type”).

That brings me to an interesting point: somehow, “following your nose” and “specific media types” have always felt like some kind of contradiction to me.
Fielding puts emphasis on media type definition:
“A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types.”

So the paradox to me here is:
- the more specific a media type (or relation name) is, the better a client can follow its nose
- but if a media type is specific, it can only be consumed by specific agents that have been programmed for that task, so in how far are they following their nose?

&gt; what's important for a service provider in addition to that might be to give clients an understanding of the set of link relations and media types they might encounter for a "service web" at a given point in time. for example, thinking back to 10 years ago, how would you have communicated the fact that "the web" back then was mostly HTML, GIF, JPEG, RSS? today, you might add PNG and Atom to this list, and maybe feed paging.

Also agree here (not coincidentally because I’m working on service descriptions that indeed try to contain the expectations about possible links).

&gt; our goal is to have a simple way of bundling these concepts (link relation types and media types) and communicating them to clients as a guide to what might happen when they follow their nose in the hypermedia space exposed by our services.

Interesting, and that’s not unlike what we are doing.
Although I know that some people are skeptical about the idea. As in: is it really “following your nose” if you already explain beforehand what’s going to happen?
I think it is, but maybe not everyone’s convinced.

&gt; i think it is important to keep in mind that a sitemap, looked at as a resource, is a very RESTful thing in itself, it contains a (large) set of links, and clients can find such a map and use such a map purely by "follow your nose" principles.

They can, provided they understand the link relations.
To what extent you think this is possible with generic clients?

Best,

Ruben

&gt; 
&gt; They can, provided they understand the link relations.
&gt; To what extent you think this is possible with generic clients?

In order to answer this question you must first define how you interpret "generic client"? Here is one interpretation:

A "generic client" is a client that understands the "processing model" of a various media-types. It knows how to 1) parse data, and 2) discover hyper-media controls (affordances) like links and forms. It does not know what the data represents in more domain specific terms (like sales orders, persons, weather maps and so on).

Generic clients can only handle generic tasks. Like Google - it knows how to 1) parse HTML (and more), and 2) follow links. Thus it can "understand" the data in a broad generic way and extract words without any domain specific knowledge.

So, to answer your question, yes, generic clients can follow a site map, given that it is represented in a standard format with hyper-media controls (this excludes plain XML and JSON). It can discover all available links and follow them, but given that it is a generic client it can, not suprisingly, only do generic stuff with it - it knows the "HOW to work with this data", but not the "WHAT is this data anyway".

&gt; That brings me to an interesting point: somehow, "following your nose" and "specific media types" have always felt like some kind of contradiction to me.

&gt; So the paradox to me here is:
&gt; - the more specific a media type (or relation name) is, the better a client can follow its nose

I think it is important to avoid mixing media types and relation names. Again, a media-type defines the "HOW to work with the data" in terms of 1) parsing and 2) discovering hyper-media controls. Once the hyper-media controls have been located you can start working with link-rels independently of original media-type.

Then you can add very specific link-rels, but any client that understands the underlying media-type will be able to "follow its nose", no matter how specific or generic the link-rels are - in the end they always represent a named link and nothing more. The name can be very specific but the link will always be generic.

&gt; - but if a media type is specific, it can only be consumed by specific agents that have been programmed for that task, so in how far are they following their nose?

I assume that by "more specific media type" you think of media-types that express domain specific semantics like "this is a sales order/person/weather map/other". You don't need that for a client to "follow its nose" - all you need is a generic media-type with well defined hyper-media controls.

With link-rels the server can show the client how to change its application state, by going from one resource to another. It does not matter how the client got those link relations - it could be from an extremely domain specific media-type or a very broad one.

The important thing is that the server is in control and the client only "follows its nose" - as opposed to be programmed with a specific hard coded flow that assumes knowledge of all URLs involved in the steps.

Linked Data is concerned with using hypertext to construct an

analysed/queried.

REST is concerned with using hypertext to expose applications so that
their evolution can be managed efficiently over time.

Basically, they use hypertext as a means to different ends. REST is
about directing the flow of the web's applications, LD is about
establishing a structure to the web's data.

One important LD-related technology is RDF, although it's not the only
way to do LD it does seem to have unearthed some of the fundamental
differences between LD and REST, so I'll share my perspective on that:

RDF, in the quest for web-intelligibility, does not seem to cope very
well with the ambiguous and messy reality of The Web. This has led to
a lot of controversy and demands from the RDF community for solutions

I personally distinguish between the traditional "Semantic Web" and "Linked

that, a great match to RESTful systems.

I think most of the "debate/mismatch/battle/whatever between REST and Linked

developers are often afraid to use it/learn it - even though heaps of them
are using those technologies without even knowing it (think Facebook's Open
Graph annotations). I usually use the term Semaphobia to describe this fear
:-)

httpRange-14, as its name suggests, is an HTTP issue not an RDF one. RDF is

Ahem, no, that would be a bit of a red herring, I'm afraid. The name stems

issue 14, where it's the other way around; it's the RDF community which has

I admittedly have a foot in three camps; HTTP/REST, RDF and Topic Maps, a
kind of tripod from War of the Webs, and I think the "problem" that's
flaring up these days are remnants and additional context to what
httpRange-14 was about, but not the same thing;

Identity management. And the problem is RDF's lack of a vocabulary (and
framework) that reflect that HTTP used as identifiers are ambiguous,
faulty, flaky, human and fallible. Topic Maps has a vocabulary that reflect
this, and that world don't struggle with this as much. HTTP/REST already
know they are, too, and they have no problem either.

&gt; Linked Data, in using RDF with HTTP, encounters this issue
&gt; but does not cause it.

They "encounter this issue" only by virtue of needing it to be something it
was never designed to be. HttpRange-14 was an amazingly bad "solution", and
LinkedData is poking a sore not yet healed.

IMHO, of course. :)

No. REST is robust enough that it can deal with the ambiguities

<pre>I think it serves to illustrate the point very well.

The Linked Data Community would like to do more with RDF than just
retrieval (HTTP GET). The REST community ought to be able to provide
guidance, but are unable to get over a few basic fundamentals of modelling
(and would mud-sling about the implementation in HTTP, everything else
being 'too philosophical').

Meanwhile the two extremes of universally-defined (link) relations and
non-shared local data schema trudges on (just like XML since the 90s)
avoiding any contact with extensible shared schemas and ontologies.

That's a real shame.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST vs. Linked Data<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>All this reminds me of the numerous discussions about media-types - whether or not they should carry any domain specific information, something which I have always had a hard time trying to understand fully.

Is it fair to say that those who think media-types can and should carry some kind of domain semantics thinks in terms of the semantic web - they want the resources to be self descriptive, but not only in terms of the processing model - also in terms of the semantics?

I myself have belonged to that group without knowing it - having that feeling of, hmmm, how can you work with resources without knowing what they actually represent? But some valuable input from Darrel Miller and Mike Kelly (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/V0hcWwQet3I/FdYY1PGUTgMJ) and this (to me) recent focus on REST vs. SemWeb has helped quite a bit understanding the differences. Thanks.

  It seems like there is an ongoing debate/mismatch/battle/whatever between REST and Linked Data (if I am interpreting various Tweets correct). Could anyone share a link to something that can enlighten me on what this is about?

  Thanks, Jørn

Message:<br><br>
<pre>OK, after thinking about it I came to conclusion that my original thought
to distinguish api requests from UI requests and therefore returning
different links in responses based on the requested media type was kinda
wrong. That decision should be based on how clients identify themselves to
the service. That way UI and API responses will be returned by exactly the
same code base, which is the goal.

With respect to implementation, most web frameworks support additional
routing features based on get/post/put/delete if not out of the box than
with some oss help.

&gt; I'm about to build a web app that should expose its functionality via API

&gt; hear your thoughts on the topic.
&gt; The functionality of the 'website' and the API intersect, with API having
&gt; additional features that should not be available from the website (from
&gt; browser). A traditional approach to building such systems seems to be
&gt; building a website and an API as two separate projects, probably even using
&gt; different technologies. That seems ineffective as there are 2 places
&gt; (website and api) which have to invoke the same business logic with all the
&gt; joys as a result. For example, adding a feature that should be exposed in
&gt; both requires adding it to 2 places. Basically you should always think
&gt; about keeping your website and API in sync. Not fun.
&gt;
&gt; And I don't want to have browsers and machine clients to work with the
&gt; same html as it can easily become too verbose.
&gt;
&gt; Another way is to have the same set of resources that a browser and
&gt; programmatic clients communicate with and use content negotiation to either
&gt; return text/html (for browser) or application/vnd.whatever+json (for
&gt; programmatic clients). With this approach only the code that converts
&gt; resource objects to representations have to differ. I have a couple of
&gt; concerns with this approach as well:
&gt;
&gt;    1. There are features that should be available via api only, meaning
&gt;    html representations may not have the same links available in json for the
&gt;    specific resource. I'm not sure this is correct as depending on which media
&gt;    type the client asks it may get completely different features. Feels kinda
&gt;    wrong, but is it?
&gt;    2. Earlier or later the two media types will start to diverge,
&gt;    specifically when we have to take care about evolvability of the 'machine'
&gt;    media type, while that is not a concern for 'humans' html. And here we go
&gt;    again  having to have different links between html and json representations.
&gt;    3. Browsers do only GET and POST. But that can be pretty easily
&gt;    overridden by X-HTTP-Method-Override to do PUT and DELETE.
&gt;
&gt; What are your overall thoughts and experience on the topic?
&gt;

&gt; today.   If anyone would care to suggest alternative terminology or
&gt; voice support for terms currently in the charter, please do so soon.

we have had (long and eventually fruitless) discussions around this in 
the WS-REST workshops. the problem is as follows:

- technically speaking, REST is an architectural style, and we don't 
want to refer to just this style, because that would allow us to build 
something other than the web, and we don't want to do that.

- what we usually want to refer to by "REST is" "the web used 
correctly", which means using the basic standards URI and HTTP and the 
supporting fabric of registered URI schemes, media types, and link 
relations. but unfortunately, there is no term for that other than "the 
web used correctly".

so we (the WS-REST participants) ended up concluding that even though 
"RESTful" is a somehow incorrect name, it is the best we have. for what 
we really want to say, there is no better name than "the web used 
correctly", and that sounds very awkward. so we continue to say 
"RESTful", even though i do agree that it is not the best name to use.

<pre>Erik, while largely agreeing with you technically, again this conflates the
issues.

"RDF has decided to use HTTP identifiers" - no, Linked Data (Principle 2)
has chosen to use HTTP identifiers. RDF, as you know, is perfectly
compatible with using non-HTTP (non-'URL') IRIs.

As it goes I'm perfectly open (if expressivity is not lost) to using
"describedby/described" relations, and am not tied (if consensus shifts) to
the HTTP-range14 solution, for publishing/consuming Linked Data.

On the other hand, when people complain about the thing/document
distinction (preferring ambiguity), and throw in the name HTTP-range14 as
if that's an RDF necessity, then that's disingenuous, as no solution is
going to work for them. They prefer to ignore the distinction altogether.
This I can not even entertain.

you're right here, and my apologies for not being crystal-clear about 
this. and this is where the trouble started. conflating identifiers and 
interaction traded easily demoable cuteness for a more robust solution 
that would allow identity and interactions to be clearly and cleanly 
separated, allowing described things and descriptions to be distributed 
in any way applications would like to do it. this design decision has 
caused all kinds of fallout, and httpRange-14 is only one of them. 
band-aids such as VoID are another one.

&gt; As it goes I'm perfectly open (if expressivity is not lost) to using
&gt; "describedby/described" relations, and am not tied (if consensus shifts)
&gt; to the HTTP-range14 solution, for publishing/consuming Linked Data.

that's great to hear, so could you please have a very brief look at 
http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/168#comment-11727 and say whether 
you think you're losing anything in such a setting? in fact, i would 
even claim you win a lot because now having descriptions of descriptions 
becomes very cleanly covered, which is sort of a problem for the hash 
URI or 303 approaches. also, we can just use the existing machinery 
(link relation type registry) and don't have to meddle with 
well-established principles such as URI opacity or overload HTTP status 
codes.

&gt; On the other hand, when people complain about the thing/document
&gt; distinction (preferring ambiguity), and throw in the name HTTP-range14
&gt; as if that's an RDF necessity, then that's disingenuous, as no solution
&gt; is going to work for them. They prefer to ignore the distinction
&gt; altogether. This I can not even entertain.

well, the fact is that for the vast majority of people it simply is not 
a problem, so they don't ignore it because they dislike it; it just 
doesn't matter. and for those more nuanced users where this distinction 
matters, i'd say that the distinction always is contextual and thus 
should be provided as context and not as indistinguishable part of 
identity (as in hash URIs), and then the web's existing mechanisms 
handle this effortlessly by allowing you to register link relations and 
relate the thing/document pairs that in your application context need to 
be related in that way.

i would really appreciate if you tried to explain what is wrong with 
such an approach, and why the describedby/describes relation is so 
radically different from other relation types that it cannot be treated 
like other links that applications would like to establish between web 
resources.

thanks a lot and cheers,

dret.

I know.. but insisting in something like this is just as naive. If you build a system that can't handle such ambiguities it just won't work at web scale. There are numerous examples.. one of them - perhaps not the best - are browser and their (sometimes insane) efforts to display your broken HTML. Where would the Web be if just 100% valid markup would have been allowed - I frankly don't know but can't really believe that it would have been to the better.

But that's just my humble opinion which won't interest the "Linked Data police" :-)

Yes, and that's the dilemma. You can't talk about RDF without these negative
connotations. This is the very reason why we tried really hard to "hide" RDF
as much as possible in the JSON-LD spec [1]. We went even so far to formally
define what define Linked Data is in the context of JSON-LD [2].


&gt; RDF can, and does, 'deal with the ambiguity of the Web'. 
&gt; Witness OpenGraph Protocol, and RDF-based solutions using it
&gt; (despite the IR/NIR ambiguity).
&gt;
&gt; This whole range14 thing is just a red herring.

I agree and there are numerous examples showing that.. but unfortunately the
RDF/Linked Data community doesn't really communicate that - range14 actually
communicates quite the opposite.

Let's once for all stop discussing these things and move on and bring the
REST community and the Linked Data community together. I'm sure there are
more common interests than disagreements and that both communities would
benefit a lot from each other.

Careful, the next stumbling block, once people run out of steam on NIR/IR,
is serialisation.

Before anyone should give a damn about serialising IRs, and publishing
NIRs, you have to grok that what RDF actually is is a directed graph model,
just like the web, where relationships are disambiguated with
URI-identified, reusable properties.

Therefore that descriptions are uniformly made with these properties, in
RDF triples (specifying which property relates which resource to which
other resource), not spread across centralised semi-standardised link
relations and non-reused ambiguous relations in tree-like data models
(JSON, XML, etc.)

That's where the discussion should surely focus, not on range14 and
serialisation. These are side issues.

<pre>Only that by linking the JSON-LD spec (and, don't get me wrong, I like RDF
via JSON, as opposed to RDF via XML) you're in danger of steering people
down this cul de sac.

The question of whether RDF, and RDF Schemas, can play nicely with REST is
not about redirects or serialisation formats, it's about whether a uniform,
simple data model can fit with a uniform, simple architecture.

The rest is noise.

I thought REST was about identifying resources and interacting with them

accepting that a common centralised bunch of link relations are all the
shared semantics that are needed and the rest can just be pushed into local
schemas with no sharing.

Am I being unfair?

Yes you are, there are lots of ways to employ hypertext under REST.
JSON-LD is impractical for most people creating RESTful applications
because it is too complex, but (afaik) it isn't "wrong".

What do you mean by 'centralised bunch of link relations'? Would you
use the same terminology if the link relations in question are URIs?

It depends. In this hypothetical could I assume that they're resolvable?

Would their representation be available in a data model I could understand?
And give me a description of their domains, ranges, more general properties
and alignments to properties defined by others?

If so, I can see that working.

RDF(S) makes that work.

It could have many representations, but HTML is the obvious choice
because that's the most sensible way to communicate the necessary
information that the _human_ needs to write the automated client code
which traverses the application.

There is no reason additional machine-readable representations could
not be introduced further down the line, I've seen applications using
link relation URIs to expose schema documents that can be applied to
the target resource.

Personally, I'm fine just HTML.

The problem with JSON-LD is that it is way too complex.

 

Most people are just looking for conventions for linking to and representing
containment/embeddedness of other resources, and leaving resource state
alone as plain old JSON properties.

Linking to other resources:

{
  "@context": "/context.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://example.com/markus",
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "knows": "http://example.com/mike"
}


Embedding resources:

{
  "@context": "/context.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://example.com/markus",
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "knows": {
    "@id": "http://example.com/mike",
    "name": "Mike Kelly"
  }
}


All you have to do is to define your context once, and store it somewhere:

"@context": {
    "foaf: "http://...",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "knows": { "foaf:knows", "@type": "@id" }
}


Too complex?

at least from my understanding of what we've been doing over the last 
couple of years, we never "changed" what REST is about. the uniform 
interface always was and still is a central building block of REST, it's 
what works because of URIs. but before you can use the uniform interface 
of a resource that has been identified, you have been linked there, by a 
typed linked that tells you about that resource in the context of the 
application scenario, and thus what it means to interact with that 
resource ("if you GET that picture, it is something that you can embed 
in the rendering of the HTML you're currently trying to display."). 
typed links always have been another essential building block of REST, 
because without them, you would never be pointed to a resource in the 
first place, and then be able to use its uniform interface. if you look 
at HTML's link types 
(http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2009/10/links-in-html.html), i think 
it's fair to say that "a centralized bunch of link relations" (in that 
case defined as part of HTML and not as standalone link types) have been 
at the very core of how the web works, why it works, and why it has been 
successful. without those link types (i.e., with an HTML only containing 
untyped generic links), the web certainly would have been a radically 
different thing, and personally, i don't think it would have succeeded. 
anyway, the point i am trying to make here is that link relation types 
are and have always been essential to REST, and whether they are defined 
as an integral part of a media type, or externally and thus can be 
reused across media types, is more of a side issue.

&gt; It depends. In this hypothetical could I assume that they're resolvable?

RFC 5988 very specifically says that they should not be treated as being 
resolvable (first paragraph of 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4.2). these URIs are 
identifiers and not links.  it is essential to make that difference, 
because not all the things that can be identified can be interacted 
with. that is one of the principles of web architecture. you'll find 
that in various places and it always annoys people (just look at XML 
namespaces and how often people complain about those URIs just being 
identifiers ;-), but even though it does annoy people, it's just how it 
is, on the web. linked data tries to change that, and whether that's a 
good design starting point or not is not something we should discuss 
here. but when looking at web things (outside of the linked data realm) 
there really is no point to take things that are *designed* to be 
identifiers, *claim* that they should be links, and then say something 
is not working as it should. it may not be what you would do following 
linked data principles, but that's a different design space.

pointing finger from linked data to the greater web and vice versa and 
claiming "you got it all wrong" will not really move us forward, and i 
think both communities have to be accepting of the design constraints of 
the other one.

That's not my reading. For pragmatic reasons it says you shouldn't hammer
the server, but explicitly allows that they can:
"point to a resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the
relation type"

It actually seems quite close to RDF versus Linked Data. RDF says the
relationship should be a URI (and for years people used identifiers that
wouldn't resolve, even though they were defined by ontologies somewhere).
Linked Data says they should.

No one actually resolves the predicate every time they see it appear in
Linked Datasets.

you know the specs. so the specs allow you to treat the identifier as a

and the important parts of Linked Data together and apply uniform interface
principles for interaction with, not just retrieval of, resources that are
represented using graph data under self-describing, extensible

I don't know the answer. I don't know enough about REST. (My message

ok, so what you're saying is that link relation types defined as part of 
a media type (such in HTML) seems to make sense to you, but having them 
as reusable components (as in the IANA link relation type registry) is 
less convincing? that a very concrete starting point for a discussion, i 
think, so what issue do you have with that? RFC 5988 was established 
fairly recently and mostly in an attempt to make link relations more 
reusable across media types, because experience showed that some link 
relations make sense for a variety of media types, and not just one. to 
me, this was mostly cleaning up the sometimes messy landscape of one 
media type saying it used the link relations defined by another media 
type, and simply establishing a framework for factoring these out of the 
media types. to me, this did not change anything about what links mean 
and how links work, it simply made it easier to engineer thing cleanly. 
to you, it seems you see a more important difference. could you explain 
what that difference is, and why you think it introduces problem?

thanks and cheers,

dret.

Subject:REST client library for C#<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Back in december 2009 I asked for some feedback on the implementation of a 
generic REST client library in C# 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/14110). I got some 
valuable feedback then and during the last three years I have been working 
on and off on something - and now, at last, it is stable and ready for use 
by any one who are consuming REST services in C#.

It is already in use at the company I work for (www.cbrain.com) where I am 
implementing a REST service for our case management system. Here Ramone is 
used to simplify the automated test code, and also in some internal 
integration service that moves data to and from another sub-system.

I have blogged a few pieces about the library here: 
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/consuming-web-apis-in-c-with-ramone.html, 
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/introducing-ramone-c-library-for-web.html 
and 
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/ramone-consuming-hyper-media-rest.html.

The code is released at Github, https://github.com/JornWildt/Ramone, under 
the Open Source MIT license.

Thanks for all the help I have gotten from this list - now its time to give 
something back :-)

Hopefully

There are basically two reasons for this. First of all, we wanted to make
the spec very clear and understandable, therefore we probably described more
than would be really necessary. The other thing is that it is still a work
in progress. We have been working on it for quite some time and it just grew

fact examples. I'm quite sure before we consider it as stable - which
hopefully happens soon - we will be able to shorten the spec quite a bit. Of
course is also has some features which other approaches don't have, e.g.,
string internationalization. But you don't need to use them if you don't
need them.

And by the way.. I've never heard someone arguing that, e.g., HTML is too
complex because the spec is too long.

The difference being, HTML has a lot more to concern itself with than
(what should be) a few conventions on top of JSON.

The JSON-LD spec says "RDF can be expressed using JSON-LD".. Is this a
requirement for JSON-LD? Or could you strip it down to bear minimum
and forfeit that capability?

<pre>&gt; The JSON-LD spec says "RDF can be expressed using JSON-LD".. Is this a
&gt; requirement for JSON-LD? Or could you strip it down to bear minimum

It is not a requirement but it was a goal to be able to be as expressive as
RDF. We currently have these special keywords in the spec:

@context - to link JSON keys to IRIs,
@id - to denote what is an IRI,
@value and @language - to specify the language of a string (I18N),
@type - to denote the type of an object/property (this is probably the most
RDFish one),
and @container with possible values of @list and @set to describe whether an
array should be considered as list or as unordered set

So there's really not that much in the end. Perhaps you could drop
@container with @list/@list but as most of the time arrays are used as sets
in JSON while the JSON spec defines them to be ordered we wanted to support
both and be explicit about what was meant buy the author. If you don't need
I18N you could also drop @language - but since some of us are from Europe
(me included) we decided to support it as it is quite important in a lot of
use cases.

What do you think could/should be dropped? I would really appreciate to hear
your opinion on that.

Markus

&gt;

I can't see any ways to pick apart JSON-LD to make it significantly
simpler (logically or aesthetically) because its whole design has been
affected by its goal of being 'as expressive as RDF'. Sorry I can't be
more specific than that, I just can't see how you can solve that
problem.

I have some more questions for you, if that's alright:

Is something like hal+json Linked Data?

Do you agree that hal+json is simpler than JSON-LD?

Is there anything about hal+json that you consider insufficient or
'wrong' as a means to expose a REST application to machines?

That's a difficult question to answer but I would tend to say no as you
treat the data as an opaque block. The properties in there have no meaning
and there's no way to, e.g., describe that two properties in two different
representations are about the same thing.


&gt; Do you agree that hal+json is simpler than JSON-LD?

Not really, but that depends on what you mean by simpler. If you are just
talking about extracting hyperlinks then, yeah, maybe, because you just have
to look for "_links" whereas in JSON-LD potentially every value could be an
IRI (by setting the type of that property to @id). But in the end that's
just a "trick" since you split every link in a "rel" and "href" part whereas
in JSON-LD the "rel" is the property itself and its value is the "href".


&gt; Is there anything about hal+json that you consider insufficient or

There's nothing wrong with it but I think it's expressivity is quite
limited.

The approach with HAL is that the meaning of a resource and its
properties are given to it by the link relation which led to its
discovery. So if you follow a link relation 'user' and you get back a
representation of a resource that includes the property 'age' - you
know the meaning of that property is 'the age of this user (resource)'
because the user rel has documentation which tells you that.

Personally, I think that approach is sufficient - buf if you
desperately felt the need to have your HAL representations explicitly
typed so that they can 'stand on their own' and not require a
preceding link relation, then you could use a profile link to do this
job (a la dret's ongoing work). I think that's a poor design decision,
but it is perfectly possible.

That isn't a "trick", it's just a good way of emulating Atom/HTML's
&lt;link&gt; and @rel with JSON.

&gt;&gt; Is there anything about hal+json that you consider insufficient or

<pre>Hi Mike

&gt; The approach with HAL is that the meaning of a resource and its
&gt; properties are given to it by the link relation which led to its
&gt; discovery. So if you follow a link relation 'user' and you get back a
&gt; representation of a resource that includes the property 'age' - you
&gt; know the meaning of that property is 'the age of this user (resource)'
&gt; because the user rel has documentation which tells you that.

We have recently been going through this discussion on another mailing list 
and, yes, I agree with you that this approach works for a lot of 
applications. But for some uses link-rels just ain't enough - and Linked 
Data seems to be one of them. I am no expert at LD but I believe I 
understand the triple &lt;subject, predicate, object&gt; conecpt - which is very 
much similar to link-rels &lt;origin-resource, relation, target-resource&gt;.

In HAL's world view a relation tells not only HOW a resource is related to 
another - it also tells WHAT the other resource is. But some relations do 
not work like this.

Take the link-rel or predicate "likes", meaning the subject X likes the 
object Y, or in HAL/REST - resource X has a "likes" relation to resource Y. 
What does that tell about Y? Nothing. The Y resource can be a dog, a movie, 
a place - anything - a client following "likes" won't have a clue about the 
type of resource in the other end, and a property called "Age" could refer 
to just about anything.

&gt; buf if you
&gt; desperately felt the need to have your HAL representations explicitly
&gt; typed so that they can 'stand on their own' and not require a
&gt; preceding link relation, then you could use a profile link to do this
&gt; job (a la dret's ongoing work). I think that's a poor design decision,
&gt; but it is perfectly possible.

Yes. It is perfectly possible and solves the problem above. But it is not 
fair to call it a poor design decision - there are certain use cases that 
requires it - Linked Data seems to be one of them.

The conflict seems to stem from two different view points: data as plain 
messages in a well known interaction versus data as typed resources taking 
part of the semantic web.

Back in december 2009 I asked for some feedback on the implementation of a generic REST client library in C# (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/14110). I got some valuable feedback then and during the last three years I have been working on and off on something - and now, at last, it is stable and ready for use by any one who are consuming REST services in C#.

It is already in use at the company I work for (www.cbrain.com) where I am implementing a REST service for our case management system. Here Ramone is used to simplify the automated test code, and also in some internal integration service that moves data to and from another sub-system.

I have blogged a few pieces about the library here: 
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/consuming-web-apis-in-c-with-ramone.html,
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/introducing-ramone-c-library-for-web.html
and
http://soabits.blogspot.com/2012/04/ramone-consuming-hyper-media-rest.html.

The code is released at Github, https://github.com/JornWildt/Ramone, under the Open Source MIT license.

Thanks for all the help I have gotten from this list - now its time to give something back :-)

Subject:Evaluating REST Frameworks - Request for feedback and help<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi All.

A couple of days ago DeveloperFusion published an article of mine that is the first part of an idea about evaluation of REST Frameworks.
That is the first part, where we simply explain as quickly as we can what REST is, then make a list of what a REST APP may require, and then we made up a maturity model for frameworks based on how much support for achieving those requirements they offer.

Any feedback is appreciated, as the model idea may benefit a lot from fresh views. I publicly thank Glenn Block for his insight and ideas in the article. So that is the first part of my request here, I know you all may have something to comment :D

The second part of my request is regarding the second part of the article: After we have the model, we need to provide an evaluation of the current frameworks! That evaluation I did long ago and without the model. Now, I do not use all the frameworks of course, so it will be great if some of you may take a look at the model, then review the framework you most work with or know, and let me know what level of support (based on the model) do you think that framework offers. It will be great including all platforms, from PHP tp Java, .NET, Ruby and any other scripting language around. Now, please bear in mind this is not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning. 

Thanks to all and I'll appreciate any comment, be that here or in the article at DeveloperFusion. Thanks a lot!

William Martinez.

<pre>I'd highly disagree that a fx to be efficient ought to have a client part. There are many http-friendly client frameworks out there, why wouldn't combining them with a server implementation be enough?

I mean asking for both client and server implementations feels like it's going in the complete opposite direction to the whole point of http as an application, so the contract is shared rather than the implementation?

Plus in my neck on the wood it would disqualify everybody bar the Microsoft implementation, or maybe servicestack if they do have a client (not sure).

Subject: [rest-discuss] Evaluating REST Frameworks - Request for feedback and help

Hi All.

A couple of days ago DeveloperFusion published an article of mine that is the first part of an idea about evaluation of REST Frameworks.
That is the first part, where we simply explain as quickly as we can what REST is, then make a list of what a REST APP may require, and then we made up a maturity model for frameworks based on how much support for achieving those requirements they offer.

Any feedback is appreciated, as the model idea may benefit a lot from fresh views. I publicly thank Glenn Block for his insight and ideas in the article. So that is the first part of my request here, I know you all may have something to comment :D

The second part of my request is regarding the second part of the article: After we have the model, we need to provide an evaluation of the current frameworks! That evaluation I did long ago and without the model. Now, I do not use all the frameworks of course, so it will be great if some of you may take a look at the model, then review the framework you most work with or know, and let me know what level of support (based on the model) do you think that framework offers. It will be great including all platforms, from PHP tp Java, .NET, Ruby and any other scripting language around. Now, please bear in mind this is not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning. 

Thanks to all and I'll appreciate any comment, be that here or in the article at DeveloperFusion. Thanks a lot!

William Martinez.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>hello mark.

thanks a lot for the feedback! i am cross-posting this response to 
rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, because it may be interesting for that 
community as well. too bad that the IETF drafts don't have commenting 
support on the IETF page itself, that would be really useful!

On 2012-04-05 09:25 , Mark Nottingham wrote:
&gt; Overall, I'm really happy to see this draft; have been considering doing something along these lines too.
&gt; *** Major issues
&gt; * "Resource Profiles" - this spec defines the profile is being about the *resource* of its context. This is too loose; in HTML and other uses I've seen, profiles are about the *representation* they occur within.

actually, most of the abstract talks about the profile qualifying a 
representation, but you're correct that this should be made very clear, 
and that it should be about the specific representation containing the 
profile link. i'll rewrite all the places where the text says that 
profiles are about resources.

&gt; In other words, the common idea of a profile, IME, is that it describes the conventions, extensions, etc. that are used in a particular document, but it doesn't say anything about the resource that the document was retrieved from.

yes, that is how it should be. only that i really would not want to say 
"describes" here, to clearly avoid the expectation that a 'profile' link 
MUST resolve to some sort of description. i'd say it "identifies" 
conventions, extensions, etc., and the only dependable operation on a 
'profile' link is to compare the URI to known profile URIs.

&gt; That's a good design, because link relations are already a defined mechanism to talk about resource behaviours; having two such mechanisms isn't a good idea (at least without some discussion).
&gt; E.g., when I interact with a resource, I know it supports particular behaviours, because it's been linked to with relation "Foo." When I get a representation from the "Foo" resource, it will have a media type that describes the format, and also a profile ("Bar") that describes additional features / conventions of that document (such as a particular use of JSON or XML), but that profile won't -- and shouldn't! -- be an additional way of describing the behaviours of the "Foo" resource.

now i am little bit confused. taking your example, i am not concerned 
with the link relation that was used to discover 'foo' at all. all i am 
concerned with is that if i am retrieving 'foo' and i find a 'bar' 
profile identifier in the representation, i know that it follows 
constraints and conventions beyond the 'foo' media type. one example i 
am currently considering adding is atompub. currently, when you retrieve 
a feed, there's no way to tell it's atompub-capable just by looking at 
it. that could be easily remedied by adding a 'profile' link identifying 
the support of atompub. that's the kind of scenario i have in mind, but 
it sounds to me you're thinking about something else, or am i just 
misunderstanding you?

&gt; *** Nits / minor feedback:
&gt; * """This link relation type is independent of the resource representation it is used in (but the representation must support types links for this mechanism to work)"""
&gt; I'd state this in terms of "context", as per the link RFC.

"This link relation type is independent of the context in which it is 
used (however, the representation must support typed links for this 
mechanism to work)"

&gt; * s/must support types links/must support typed links/

done.

&gt; * """
&gt;     In fact, for the purpose of this
&gt;     specification, the URI does not necessarily have to link to a
&gt;     dereferencable resource, and clients can treat the occurrence of a
&gt;     specific URI in the same sense as a namespace URI and invoke specific
&gt;     behavior based on the assumption that a specific profile URI signals
&gt;     that a resource follows a specific profile.
&gt; """
&gt; Here, I'd state this in terms of "target URIs", as does the link RFC.

"In fact, for the purpose of this specification, the target URI does not 
necessarily have to identify a dereferencable resource (or even use a 
dereferencable URI scheme), and clients can treat the occurrence of a 
specific URI in the same way as an XML namespace URI and invoke specific 
behavior based on the assumption that a specific profile target URI 
signals that a resource representation follows a specific profile."

&gt; * Your Security Considerations section isn't going to pass muster; if it were me, I'd talk about how software shouldn't make security-sensitive assumptions based upon profiles.

any specific suggestions on how to phrase that? ;-)

&gt; *"""
&gt;     As one example, consider the case of podcasts, a specific kind of
&gt;     feed using additional fields for media-related metadata.  Using a
&gt;     'profile' link, it would be possible for a client to understand that
&gt;     a specific feed is supposed to be a podcast feed, and that it may
&gt;     contain entries using podcast-specific fields.  This may allow a
&gt;     client to behave differently when handling such a feed (such as
&gt;     rendering a UI), even when the current set of entries in the feed may
&gt;     not contain any podcast entries.
&gt; """
&gt; This is an interesting use case. My use cases for "profile" tend to be things like "links that this document contain follow *this* convention". More examples would be good.

to me, it's both about those links and about conventions followed in the 
document itself. i am currently planning to include three examples in 
the next version of the draft:

- HCard
- Dublin Core
- AtomPub

particularly this last one might be what you're looking for, right? if 
you have any suggestions what to add to this list, please let me know.

thanks a lot for the feedback! i'll continue working on the examples, 
and as soon as these are finished, i am planning to publish -01 and see 
whether the additional examples make it easier to understand what this 
draft is trying to accomplish, and there might be more feedback.

cheers and happy easter everybody,

dret.

Subject:Re: Evaluating REST Frameworks - Request for feedback and help<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Sebastien.
Thanks for the comment!. It will help me to clarify two little
misconceptions (that even after 4 revisions to the article's text,
almost rewriting it, still prevail):

1. The model is not to disqualify anything! As I said, a level 1 still
provides support for REST even if the developer needs to write or use
other frameworks to complete his job. Nor it is saying that level 4 or 5
is the most efficient. What we are depicting here is all the support a
framework can offer. They ARE ALL REST frameworks, but some offer more
support than others, and some offer support in different ways.

2. Yes, I Glen also commented against having the client part included,
even after the discussion in this same list about the client being part
of the REST system or not. Truth is that we cannot simply say the client
part is not part of REST and that is why some frameworks are actually
offering client support (yes, far more that just MS). In M2M scenarios,
one server can actually be client of another server. The last REST
substyle is the layered one, meaning we can have several layers of
client-server and they should follow the same rules. Now, we are not
asking for a client and server implementation. We are asking for support
on development. That is a little different.

Finally, as it has been discussed before, we can have two different
developers. Glen mentioned the case of the server being implemented in
one particular language/platform, and then the framework supporting all
the other languages out there fot the client part? Makes no sense and he
is right. But if we have two developers, one creating the server with
one framework, and the other one creating the client, we cannot FORCE
the client developer to use the server framework, that is against REST
idea. But then we cannot doom the client guy to write all HTTP
interactions and conneg from scratch everytime either! If we have a
framework that help us with the client part, great!. Nobody is saying we
need the same framework!

Now think of me creating a server that needs to consume other REST
interface in another server I'm not creating. I can use two frameworks,
or use one that allows me to create the server and also connect to the
other server.

What I'm trying to say is client is an important part, and we cannot
left it out just to allow all the frameworks out there to be level 5.

The client part is controversial, I know, but we have to treat it
somewhere. Any ideas of improvements, beyond just kicking it out?

Thanks.

William Martinez.

<pre>Hi William,

Looks to be an interesting "project".


&gt; Now, please bear in mind this is
&gt; not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As
&gt; stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the
&gt; developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are
&gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the
&gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It
&gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning.

It's quite normal that people use those levels as ranking. I think it would
make the intention much clearer if you would create a matrix instead of
using these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for routing
and media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.

You can't do that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and 5??
Is it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it's too late to
change that as the article has already been published..

Yeah, Richardson's model is a very clear progression and relates mostly
to uris and methods. Which actually the more i think about it is
lacking as REST is much more than that.

In this case i wonder if a point based scoring system would be better.
In particular because we are talking about how well the fwk supports
REST rather than the system itself that uses it.

Message:<br><br>

Markus, that is a very important point. Thanks.
Now, it is very difficult to add points to such a broad set of implementations. I like the matrix idea, but with a twist, using it like we are using a competency framework at IASA.

We can put a set of features and a list of levels for each. Say, in architecture, viewpoints. The architect may 1. never heard of them, 2. know the theory, 3. used them once or twice. 4. can't live without using them, 5. He invented them.

Likewise, levels for each feature would be 1. no support, 2. can be done somehow, 3. offers a special component for it, 4. Fully automated. 

That matrix can be a better tool for deciding, based on what do I need from the framework, I read the matrix's scorecard for the framework and I may know the tool with the best combination of features.

The maturity model idea was simply because I visualize the tool at early stages only offering basic http support for a simple REST service, and at latest stage in evolution offering support for complex systems, that is why the levels are incremental, and each level may improve the support on the lower levels features. I'm risking here one tool offering a non balanced solution with support for on-demand code  and at the same time very basic http support. The actual evaluation of current frameworks would give us an idea of that, if there is one FW that comes out to be in more that one level.

No worries about the article published, as nothing is written in stone and there is always a "...revisited" kind of article possibility.

Do you use any framework? Where would you put it using the model's levels?

Cheers!

William.

Oops, It seems you phone broke a little the thread :D
I actually think a points based model would be like a next level measurement tool. One is a broad way of categorizing the tools, then other one a fine valuation of how well that tool performs in the actual level it is located. 
Creating that model may require much more detail and discussion, which is something we should engage in a near future.

&gt; Yeah, Richardson's model is a very clear progression and relates mostly
&gt; to uris and methods. Which actually the more i think about it is
&gt; lacking as REST is much more than that.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case i wonder if a point based scoring system would be better.
&gt; In particular because we are talking about how well the fwk supports

&gt; Hi William,
&gt; 
&gt; Looks to be an interesting "project".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, please bear in mind this is
&gt; &gt; not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As
&gt; &gt; stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the
&gt; &gt; developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are
&gt; &gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the
&gt; &gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It
&gt; &gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning.
&gt; 
&gt; It's quite normal that people use those levels as ranking. I think it would
&gt; make the intention much clearer if you would create a matrix instead of
&gt; using these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for routing
&gt; and media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.
&gt; 
&gt; You can't do that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and 5??
&gt; Is it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it's too late to
&gt; change that as the article has already been published..

Possibly. I didn't think of this as much when I was reviewing the article.
The problem I see with the progression model is that it has a black and
white sense to it, you are either level 0, level 1, level 2. The more I
think about it though it breaks down.

For example take the hypermedia case. You can build a hypermedia based
system that is not RESTful. I can have a framework that makes it easy to
offer up links, but yet it does not support the other constraints of REST.

Another example is the whole client thing. OK, my REST framework supports
an HTTP client, but the server implementation is pretty lousy. What level
is it? And how is that information useful?

Have some sort of point system across different categories helps me to make
an informed decision about how well this framework will support my needs if
I am looking to build a RESTful system.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, Richardson's model is a very clear progression and relates mostly
&gt; &gt; to uris and methods. Which actually the more i think about it is
&gt; &gt; lacking as REST is much more than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In this case i wonder if a point based scoring system would be better.
&gt; &gt; In particular because we are talking about how well the fwk supports
&gt; &gt; REST rather than the system itself that uses it.

&gt; &gt; feedback and help
&gt; &gt; Hi William,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looks to be an interesting "project".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, please bear in mind this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As
&gt; &gt; &gt; stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the
&gt; &gt; &gt; developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the
&gt; &gt; &gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's quite normal that people use those levels as ranking. I think it
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; make the intention much clearer if you would create a matrix instead of
&gt; &gt; using these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for
&gt; routing
&gt; &gt; and media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can't do that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and
&gt; 5??
&gt; &gt; Is it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it's too late to
&gt; &gt; change that as the article has already been published..

Subject:Re: Evaluating REST Frameworks - Request for<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>You just gave a great point to think about, Glen!
A framework may give you support for just one constrain in REST, but lacks support for all the other ones. You may still be able to achieve a truly RESTful system with this, but you may also end up with an RPC based thing. The question is if we can blame the framework? Should we also take into account the restrictions the framework can add to avoid this situation?

Interesting!

William.

&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. I didn't think of this as much when I was reviewing the article.
&gt; The problem I see with the progression model is that it has a black and
&gt; white sense to it, you are either level 0, level 1, level 2. The more I
&gt; think about it though it breaks down.
&gt; 
&gt; For example take the hypermedia case. You can build a hypermedia based
&gt; system that is not RESTful. I can have a framework that makes it easy to
&gt; offer up links, but yet it does not support the other constraints of REST.
&gt; 
&gt; Another example is the whole client thing. OK, my REST framework supports
&gt; an HTTP client, but the server implementation is pretty lousy. What level
&gt; is it? And how is that information useful?
&gt; 
&gt; Have some sort of point system across different categories helps me to make
&gt; an informed decision about how well this framework will support my needs if
&gt; I am looking to build a RESTful system.
&gt; 
&gt; My $.02
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi William,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Looks to be an interesting "project".
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, please bear in mind this is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It's quite normal that people use those levels as ranking. I think it would
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; make the intention much clearer if you would create a matrix instead of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; using these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for routing
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; You can't do that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and 5??
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Is it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it's too late to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; change that as the article has already been published..

Subject:Bachelor Thesis on a RESTful API for a Groupware/OpenSocial<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

please allow me to bring to your attention my just finished bachelor thesis on 
the subject of the design of a restful API to be useful for a Groupware or the 
person related informations of OpenSocial.

I'd appreciate any feedback. The text will be available under a free license 
after I received the mark for it.

Points that might be of special interest for (some of) you:

 - a modernized design of CalAtom/CardAtom[1] without the need for a new 
   "feature" property
 - efficient synchronization of collections with restful HTTP
 - properties of vCard useful (or missing) for OpenSocial
 - use of OpenSearch for reports
 - use of nice small value objects replacing some functionality of Jersey 
   (Java REST framework)
 - a "resource facade" framework to support multiple "views" or media types of 
    the same data 
 - a minimal implementation of an atom pub server on top of Jersey

[1] http://robubu.com/?cat=2

http://github.com/thkoch2001/bachelor-
thesis/blob/master/latex/restful_groupware.pdf

Please be forgiving with the quality of my writing. It's a thesis written 
under time pressure and other constraints and I'm not a writer.

Best regards,

Thomas Koch, http://www.koch.ro

&gt;&gt; That's a good design, because link relations are already a defined mechanism to talk about resource behaviours; having two such mechanisms isn't a good idea (at least without some discussion).
&gt;&gt; E.g., when I interact with a resource, I know it supports particular behaviours, because it's been linked to with relation "Foo." When I get a representation from the "Foo" resource, it will have a media type that describes the format, and also a profile ("Bar") that describes additional features / conventions of that document (such as a particular use of JSON or XML), but that profile won't -- and shouldn't! -- be an additional way of describing the behaviours of the "Foo" resource.
&gt; 
&gt; now i am little bit confused. taking your example, i am not concerned with the link relation that was used to discover 'foo' at all. all i am concerned with is that if i am retrieving 'foo' and i find a 'bar' profile identifier in the representation, i know that it follows constraints and conventions beyond the 'foo' media type.

Yup.

&gt; one example i am currently considering adding is atompub. currently, when you retrieve a feed, there's no way to tell it's atompub-capable just by looking at it.

Well, what thing in this case is atom pub capable? The format that the links are occurring within, or the targets of the links themselves? I'd argue the latter. You can take that argument too far, of course, but generally I see profiles as describing format conventions, and link relations as describing behaviours of resources. Of course, some of those behaviours can be "produce this format" and some of the formatting conventions can be "link to something with this behaviour".

Am happy to be proven wrong on this, I just think we need good patterns of use / best practices to encourage reasonable design.

Make sense?

The thing is that it is not necessary to *learn* this. If it is your expectation that the service you are interacting with is actually an atompub service then fine, go ahead. If the service behaves as you expect, fine; your use case succeeds.

If it isn't you'll discover that from the response and change configuration of your set of entry URIs or whatever.

The decision regarding your use case comes first and you do not need to double check at runtime. For example, you have a bookmark for your favorite search engine. Do you check every time you use that bookmark whether the search engine is still there? Or do you just use the bookmark based according to your expectations?

Likewise, what does that check for atompub capabilities buy you? The reason you check for them is that you assume they are there in the first place. If that check fails .... then what? You are in exactly the same situation as when you POST you atom entry right away and see what happens.


The nature (as in "Amazon is an online store") of services changes slowly (if at all) and the particular HTTP idioms that services use also changes slowly (e.g. creation with PUT vs. creation with POST). In REST there is, IMHO at least, a third xxx-time besides the traditional design-time and run-time. It is what I think of as 'configuration-time'. This is where a method like OPTIONS plays its part, for example. Try out a service once, learn what it is and what its particularities are and then adjust your configuration for interactions with that service. The things you discover at configuration-time are not likely to change soon. If they do, you adjust your configuration and maybe you do not need to do that , ever.

&gt;

Subject:Unsafe methods and Link Relations<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi!  I'm wondering about RFC 5988, which says very little about how to
process links other than the word "dereference" (4 times) which might imply
using a safe method to GET something.

Are Link: headers and &lt;atom:link&gt; elements primarily designed to support
navigation using safe methods?

Are there any link relations out there that have processing instructions
that say "POST to me to do this" or something similarly unsafe?  I'm only
aware of atom's "edit" link relation, which says something about GET and
PUT, but that's the exception, and in any case you typically start by
GET'ing it anyway, so you're still dereferencing the link.

Atom uses the &lt;app:collection&gt; element to indicate that you can POST
entries to a collection; HTML uses the &lt;form&gt; element...  Again, shunning
links when it comes to "unsafety".

Are links inherently meant to be safe links?

RFC 4287 says &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7.2&gt;: "The
value of "rel" describes the meaning of the link, but does not impose
any behavioral requirements on Atom Processors."

Does this mean that the documentation of any given rel can NOT say anything
about how a link should be used?

On the other hand, RFC 5988 (which updates 4287)
says&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4.1&gt;:
"Relation types [...] can specify the behaviours and properties of the
target resource (e.g., allowable HTTP methods, request and response media
types that must be supported)."

Good question.

&gt;

I'm only aware of atom's "edit" link relation, which says something about GET and PUT, but that's the exception, and in any case you typically start by GET'ing it anyway, so you're still dereferencing the link.

The meaning of 'edit' is more like: "Here is the primary resource for an entry. If you intend to change the state of the entry, use this URI".

The question of *how* you do that is up to your intentions - Atompub merely gives a hint to how that might be done.

&gt; 
&gt; Atom uses the &lt;app:collection&gt; element to indicate that you can POST entries to a collection;

Again, &lt;app:collection&gt; is telling you something about the nature of the resource. The POST thing is merely a hint (even atompub cannot constrain servers in any way beyond HTTP). Think of the POST thing as a hint to implementors how it SHOULD be done on both sides.

&gt; HTML uses the &lt;form&gt; element...  Again, shunning links when it comes to "unsafety".
&gt; 
&gt; Are links inherently meant to be safe links?

No, I do not think so.

&gt; 
&gt; RFC 4287 says: "The value of "rel" describes the meaning of the link, but does not impose any behavioral requirements on Atom Processors."
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean that the documentation of any given rel can NOT say anything about how a link should be used?

Yes, indeed; link rel specs cannot constrain servers to behave in a special way. It can provide hints though.  But in the end, the server is always free to do what it wants and the client needs to expect that.

Usually, these 'how'-things do not change frequently. See my last mail on configuration time.

&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, RFC 5988 (which updates 4287) says: "Relation types [...] can specify the behaviours and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable HTTP methods, request and response media types that must be supported)."

That is an over-specification ... which, unfortunately, AtomPub contains in many places (e.g. GET on &lt;app collections&gt; returning application/atom+xml. AtomPUb cannot constrain servers in such a way).

Subject:"Framing the Future", a RESTful two-phase commit pattern<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

We are working on a REST API for the server-side of a graphical modeling
platform. Our resources - models, diagrams and elements - are
hierarchical by nature and our server keeps track of revisions of these
models.

The platform allows users to work on the same models simultaneous.
Concurrency is realized using a git-inspired strategy; when a user
starts working, he starts working on a new revision that is not yet
shared with others. The unshared update a user is working on, does
reside on the server, so the user can close his session and continue
later wihout having to share his changes.

As a user's work evolves, the system claims the resources he touches,
making sure he can effectuate his changes at a later point in time. This
pessimistic approach appears to fit our customers the best. Of course
claims have a time-out to avoid dead-lock and/or starvation.

To expose the functions that we support in a RESTful way, we came up
with a two-phase-commit-pattern we like to refer to as the 'framing the
future'-pattern: A user can frame a resource by posting a frame to it,
create or update child resources by posting these to the frame instead
of the resource and have these changes take affect somewhere in the
future:

We use Frames, Catches and Patches as a means to let clients transfer
preliminary state as if it were final state, with the guarantee that
this state can be finalized later. The terminolgy should be understood
as follows: A Frame represents a snapshot view on your resource, a Catch
refreshes your snapshot and a Patch effectuates your changes to it.
Frames present resources as if your are the only one changing them,
without actually putting your changes to effect. So you don't bother
others with your changes and others don't bother you with theirs... Yet.
Because you can choose to catch up with patches others made by posting a
Catch. And if you would choose to post a Patch, others may in turn post
a Catch to catch up with your changes.

From within a Frame you see exactly the same resources as from outside a
Frame, at least for the time you don't do any (preliminary) updates from
within that Frame and as long as nobody else effectuates any updates.
When you do update resources from within your Frame, these resources
only reflect your changes within that Frame; from outside your Frame
these resources will show as before. One could say a Frame provides you
with a view on your resources as if your changes have actually taken
place and as if changes someone else made after you created your Frame
have never taken place.

Only when you post a Catch to your Frame, it will reflect changes that
were finalized from outside your Frame and only when you post a Patch to
your Frame, your changes will in turn be effectuated. After posting a
Patch, all resources will reflect your changes, both from within your
Frame and from outside your Frame; only other Frames that were created
beofre you patched won't show your changes as long as these don't catch
up. From this point on you can keep on using your Frame to make new
changes. These changes will be treated like before you posted your first
Patch; you will need to post another Patch to finalize these new
changes.

A Frame provides certainty when it comes to finalizing your changes, but
only to a certain extend. A Frame comes with a time-out; when the Frame
expires it won't accept any postings anymore, which means you will loose
your changes after your last Patch. After each Patch, a Frame's
expiration date will be reset. As long as a Frame does not expire, it
will use a pessimistic claiming strategy to ensure you can finalize your
changes later. As a consequence, updates you make from within a Frame,
may bounce as resources may already be claimed by other users from
within their Frames.

All can be illustrated using the following scenario with two users that
add an element to the same diagram of a model in parallel:

// before posting a frame User 1 sees a single element in diagram 1 of
model 1
// after posting a new element within his frame, the diagram shows
elements 1 and 2
User 1 GET @ /models/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1]
User 1 POST frame @ /models/1/frames -&gt; frame 1
User 1 POST element @ /models/1/frames/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; element
2
User 1 GET @ /models/1/frames/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1,
element 2]

// as the updates of User 1 are preliminary, User 2 also sees only one
element
// after posting a new element within his frame, the diagram shows
elements 1 and 3
User 2 GET @ /models/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1]
User 2 POST frame @ /models/1/frames -&gt; frame 2
User 2 POST element @ /models/1/frames/2/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; element
3
User 2 GET @ /models/1/frames/2/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1,
element 3]
User 2 POST patch @ /models/1/frames/2/patches -&gt; patch 1
User 2 DELETE @ /models/1/frames/2

// even though User 2 posted a patch, User 1 still only sees elements 1
and 2
// however, after posting a catch, frame 1 does reflect the changes of
User 2
User 1 GET @ /models/1/frames/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1,
element 2]
User 1 POST catch @ /models/1/frames/1/catches -&gt; catch 1
User 1 GET @ /models/1/frames/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1,
element 2, element 3]
User 1 POST patch @ /models/1/frames/1/patches -&gt; patch 1
User 1 DELETE @ /models/1/frames/1

// now that both users shared their updates by posting a patch to their
frame
// the actual resource reflects all the updates and show the same to all
users
User 1 GET @ /models/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1, element 2,
element 3]
User 2 GET @ /models/1/diagrams/1/elements -&gt; [element 1, element 2,
element 3]

I'm curious what other's think about this approach, so please share your
thoughts on this pattern.

I'll take a look at your work, as I've been meaning to look into
OpenSocial anyway, vis-a-vis REST of course.  But I can't make any
promises to cut any slack on writing quality.  Don't take it
personally, but I'm comprehending less and less of the "academic"
papers I'm asked to review, due to writing and document structure that
wouldn't have made it out of High School in my day, and this is from
honors students.

I blame both the deteriorating state of education, and SMS.  I've read
plenty of theses over the years, they were all written under time
pressure and the constraints of living life, but in recent years the
writing quality has just gotten deplorable to the point that it isn't
just bad writing, but incomprehensible to I guess everyone but the
teachers and professors who let it slide.  It isn't part of the
standardized testing, so it can't be all that important, seems to be
the student attitude we've created.

/rant

Since you warned me and asked nicely, I'll do my best to take the
attitude that you've been shortchanged by the system and behave myself,
unless I find something's really confusing.

good to see we're in basic agreement.

You can take that argument too far, of course, but generally I see profiles as describing format conventions, and link relations as describing behaviours of resources. Of course, some of those behaviours can be "produce this format" and some of the formatting conventions can be "link to something with this behaviour".

with atompub i think you're right about 'edit' links in entries, so if i 
aggregate atompub-capable feeds, then my aggregate feed may not be 
atompub-capable, but the entries may very well be. but if my feed is 
indeed able to accept POST requests to create new entries, then there 
simply is no link to represent that fact, and a profile URI would be one 
way to represent that capability in the feed itself.

while i see your point about profile more being about format conventions 
(this is where HTML started this idea, and in that case my podcast 
example might better fit your bill), i think eventually the line between 
format conventions and behavior is fuzzy. maybe the best way for me to 
go forward is to finish the examples section, and then we can start more 
concrete discussions whether this would be the kind of scenario we'd 
like to encourage for 'profile' links.

Ok (though I personally would not see a profile as saying something about the resource, but about the payload)

Anyhow - have you considered supporting your use case with the 'service' link relation? The pointed-to service document would tell your UA, what resource are app-collections.

(BTW, seems the registry is broken there, because service cites atompub as its spec - which it is not).

&gt; 
&gt; if all operations in atompub were exposed via links, it would be a different story in this particular case, but they are not, so a profile URI would be one way to go. and it's just one example and not the whole 'profile' story.

Right; that would be consistent with the use of the profile attribute in 
HTML4.

Seems we need a spec for "service" then.

yup, that occurred to me a while ago when i was looking for a spec for

nobody seemed to think that was an issue that needed fixing. i think it 
would be good to have an actual spec (just out of curiosity it would be

being spec'ed or reviewed a la rfc5988), and since i am in spec writing

since this one would likely update rfc5023, i'd suggest to maybe also 
(if we can get agreement around this) include a 'profile' URI, assuming

It seems you are using "profile" in a very different way then it was

yes, we have agreement on this. a profile (quoting from the -01 text i 
am writing now) "are additional semantics that can be used to process a 
resource  representation, such as constraints, conventions, extensions, 
or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type semantics."

if a feed indicates it supports atompub, that extends what to expect in 
the feed, and in case of atompub, it also extends the feed's behavior. 
like i said in a response to mark, i think the line between "format 
conventions" and "behavior" is fuzzy. but i'd argue that the 'atompub 
profile' definitely would be specific for the representation (the 
atompub enabled feed), because a different representation of the 
collection resource might very well expose a different mechanism to 
provide write access to the collection.

cheers,

dret.

i certainly do not intend to use it in a different way, because like

that "a profile are additional semantics that can be used to process a 
resource representation, such as constraints, conventions, extensions,

my understanding of HTML's profile was always like this. quoting from 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#profiles :

"User agents may be able to recognize the name (without actually 
retrieving the profile) and perform some activity based on known 
conventions for that profile. For instance, search engines could provide 
an interface for searching through catalogs of HTML documents, where 
these documents all use the same profile for representing catalog entries."

mark also noted that he regards a profile mostly as saying something 
about a representation's content, such as a metadata profile in HTML, 
saying that the web page uses dublin core. but even when you look at the 
dublin core HTML profile (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/), it 
also defines conventions about links 
(http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/#sect-2-4), and not just about 
non-link data. which is the point i was trying to make saying that the 
line between "format extensions" and "links" is fuzzy: essentially, a 
link *is* a format extension, only one that extends beyond the current 
resource.

i am not sure i was able to fully address your concerns, so if you still 
think i am "redefining" what 'profile' is supposed to do, could you be a 
bit more specific why you think that's the case, and how you'd like to 
see it done?

thanks a lot and cheers,

Maybe we need to switch to examples to get a clearer picture.

With "profile" I understand that the link *target* is a URI describing 
the profile, such as &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/03/hcard&gt; which describes 
that hcard profile.

If you want to use the profile link relation to declare that something 
is a an AtomPub server, on which resource would you set the link relation?

so i guess the difference here is the following:

- 'profile' would just say that a feed is atompub-enabled, but it would 
not allow you to discover the specific service description for that 
feed. it would just be a link to discover and understand that i can POST 
to that URI.

- 'service' would link to the specific service description for that 
feed, and thus must be a working link and would allow clients to find 
out more about the service provided by the atompub server.

to be honest, i just looked at "naked atompub" and thought 'profile' 
might be a good thing and a good example for the 'profile' spec. if we 
assume "atompub + 'service'" is being used, then maybe 'profile' is of 
little additional value, and i should stop using it as an example.

which (and now i am happily cross-posting to atom-protocol@... as 
well) leads me to the question: should we have a 'service' spec or are 
we happy with 'service' just magically showing up in the registry? as 
somebody just reading and implementing atompub right now, there's no way 
for me to find out about 'service', so i think it should be properly 
spec'ed. if people agree (feedback from atom-protocol@... would be 
very welcome), i'd be happy to come up with a first draft.

cheers,

dret.

<pre>Hi Erik,

&gt; the feed served by the atompub-enabled server would contain such a
&gt; 'profile' link on the feed level, indicating to a client that it can
&gt;POST to that feed's URI to create a new collection member.

In the case of Atompub, the presence of the app:collection element can be used to POST to the collection.

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-8.3.5

The thing that I am wondering about is whether the 'profile' link relation could not also (instead) be
put to use as an advertisement to clients via a MIME media type parameter ie application/atom+xml;type=feed;profile=calendar

According to RFC 2046, parameters which are not understood must be ignored.
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-1

So, a feed reader which knew nothing of the 'profile' parameter would still recognize the main media type (application/atom+xml), but might not
recognize or care about 'type' or 'profile'.

Those which did know (+ support ) this parameter would pick this feed over others which had different profiles, and
they would actuate code which expected / parsed the calendar aspect in particular.

I think this is similar to the 'charset' parameter which tells clients how to interpret the bytes they encounter, this is
just at a more abstract semantic level.

Cheers,
Peter

According to [1] and [2], both seem to fit.  I presume there's a subtlety or two I'm missing?


Thx

[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
[2] http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc4918.html#rfc.section.12.1

409: Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type. [1]

412: Any request can contain a conditional header defined in HTTP (If-Match, If-Modified-Since, etc.) or the "If" or "Overwrite" conditional headers defined in this specification. If the server evaluates a conditional header, and if that condition fails to hold, then this error code must be returned. On the other hand, if the client did not include a conditional header in the request, then the server must not use this status code. [2]

<pre>hello.

"The 'profile' Link Relation Type" is now available as version 01 
(draft-wilde-profile-link-01) at 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link. the changes are 
listed at 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-01#section-7.1, with 
the main changes being a bigger section with some examples, and the text 
in general has been revised to make it clear that profiles relate to 
representations (the ones they are found in) and not to resources.

thanks for all the feedback so far, more feedback would be very welcome, 
and should you happen to be at www2012 this coming week, say hello and 
let me know what you think about 'profile' links!

cheers,

dret.

it seems to me that at that level, discussing "generic" versus "domain" 
is very binary, and very subjective. for example, to me, atom is both 
generic (it says nothing about the payload) and specific (it operates in 
the domain of collections exposing a fairly specific set of metadata). 
the usefulness of atom is based on the fact that it is generic enough to 
be reusable, and specific enough to build generic clients that still can 
do useful things. my personal viewpoint is that generic is good if it is 
still a domain with useful behavior. if it is more generic than that 
(just "objects" that have "actions"), then it indeed is pretty useless. 
even though you could still provide patterns at that level, only that 
this level itself would not make sense to be made available as a RESTful 
service.

sounds a lot like "profiles" to me ;-) apart from that, i am wondering 
how you deal with the formats/types. because it's exactly what we are 
doing, and my thinking is to provide the foundation as a media type 
(robust and stable over time, and with a well-defined extension model), 
and provide the formats/types as profiles with well-defined descriptions 
which can be interpreted at run time by clients wondering about the 
format/type. generic clients can still happily live with the media type, 
and since the media type also defines how format/type data has to be 
represented, even generic clients can do some basic stuff (rendering in 
a basic UI, for example, but without knowing what that field means), 
while more sophisticated ones can learn about the profile at runtime. is 
that a design that's similar to yours, or how are you dealing with user 
formats/types? to me, it seems that expressing those as media types 
would not have the stability that you would expect from a media type, so 
they should use something more dynamic (like profiles) instead.

That's a good question. I think the *sense* of the spec is that, if the
client sends an If-Match that doesn't match the current state of the
resource, the server would always return 412. That seems to be the sense
of
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional-19#section-
3.1

However, the actual text states, "If the request would, without the
If-Match header field, result in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status
code, then the If-Match header field MUST be ignored," which would seem
to imply from a strict reading that if you return 409 when a client
omits If-Match, you should also return 409 when a client sends it. But
that seems to make 412 an un-emittable response, so I doubt that's the
intent. One can imagine that paragraph is intended more to address 3xx,
400, 404, etc., and 409 was included by default without proper
consideration of this corner case. Perhaps something to take up with the
IETF (is httpbis out of last call yet?)

Message:<br><br>
<pre>hello walter.

&gt; Thanks for the update.
&gt; Such types of link have also been widely used for years together with the webfinger specification (usually under the http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page rel type for html profile pointers) so I would suppose it will also relate to the wf/swd discussion and that ultimately this draft becomes compatible with the discovery solution ultimately specified. It may be worth adding it as an example.

thanks for the pointer to web finger. i am sure there are quite a number 
of other formats out there using html profiles, maybe it would be 
interesting to create a small list of "well-known" profiles.

&gt; I would also suggest to emphasize the usage on the "type" attribute together with this link rel to better characterize the type of information a client should expect. Indeed I would expect in some cases more than one of such "profile" link rel to be published within the same document, and the type may be useful for this. E.g. so far in wf the http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page and http://microformats.org/profile/hcard (and to some extent the http://portablecontacts.net/spec/1.0#me) rel types are widely used to discriminate the expect type of "profile" format/info accessible. It would be valuable to maintain such flexibility.

while i think that the "type" idea is interesting, i am confused that 
you suggest http://microformats.org/profile/hcard as such a type. 
afaict, hCard is a specific profile and does not define a format for 
describing profiles. i would expect types to define a framework that 
could be used to define specific profiles, but maybe we have a different 
idea of what a "type" attribute could do? could you explain why you 
consider http://microformats.org/profile/hcard to be a type instead of a 
specific profile?

thanks and cheers,

dret.

&gt; [walter] some work in that direction has been already recorded here [1] that you may want to check

these are link relation types and not profile identifiers, right? i am 
a bit concerned to see expected media types encoded in link relations, 
for example i'd prefer to see a "contact" link type and then getting a 
vCard or an xCard or HTML-embedded hCard is up to conneg and thus a 
runtime issue. doing it that way frees you from having to mint new link 
relation types when you want to support new media types (what about FoaF 
contact info, for example?).

&gt; [walter] maybe i wasn't clear enough I apologize. I was indeed referring to the "type" attribute/parameter of the "link" element/header, which is already defined both in RFC5988 and in XRD for referencing the media-type associated with that link. In that sense an hcard link rel would typically be "text/html" whilst a poco#me representation of the "profile" link could be "application/json".

and that doesn't really help at all. for it to be helpful, the profile 
description language would need to have a media type, and then you could 
identify it by that. and generally speaking, a 'profile' link should not 
need to be dereferenced to be useful, it's an identifier. that also 
means that designing an environment where runtime lookup of the profile 
description is necessary would be a violation of the spec, because 
clients would not be able to "understand" that the meaning of a profile 
URI changes over time. this almost automatically means that any updates 
in the profile need to done by minting a new profile URI, and if it is 
done backwards compatible, then representations conforming to the new 
profile should list both profile versions:

&lt;link rel="profile" href="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard"/&gt;
&lt;link rel="profile" href="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard/2.0"/&gt;

&gt; However I do understand that this may not be enough for correctly characterizing the format of the specific profile information: how would I indicate in fact that this "profile" link/web page is hcard-enabled or not a priori? Same for json: poco is a popular json format for representing profile info but may not be the only one.

if there is a format for describing profile information, then it should 
have a media type and then web clients can use that media type. just 
referring to it as JSON is not very helpful. but even if there was such 
a media type, it would not change the fact that the way how 'profile' is 
drafted right now, runtime access to profile descriptions is not part of 
the design; clients compare supported profile URIs to the profiles they 
find in a representation, and then decide what to do.

&gt; My point is I may have the following xrd at this stage with the profile rel links:
&gt; &lt;Link rel="profile" type="text/html" href="http://example.com/profiles/joe" /&gt;
&gt; &lt;Link rel="profile" type="text/html" href="http://example.com/profiles/joe/hcard" /&gt;
&gt; &lt;Link rel="profile" type="application/json" href="http://example.com/profiles/joe/poco" /&gt;
&gt; ...without any clear view on which "profile" provides which format.
&gt; I hope I have clarified my point here and welcome your feedback on this.

now i am getting the impression that you're having some misconceptions 
about profile. profile links are not intended to link to particular 
resource that contains data of interest to the client. in your example, 
the page would be about joe, and joe might decide to embed his 
information using hcard, and then the page would say

&lt;link rel="profile" href="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard"/&gt;

and clients could extract joe's hcard info from the page without ever 
accessing http://microformats.org/profile/hcard; they would simply see 
that URI and then, if they supported hCard, understand that the page 
contain embedded hCard information.

i hope that clarifies things a bit. cheers,

dret.

defined by using link rels for variety, and a DSP by using media types?

for example, i had a brief exchange with mike who was saying that HTML 
clearly is domain-agnostic, whereas my view of HTML is that it is 
specific for human-oriented hypertext documents with a certain set of

Subject:Re: Rel attributes?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>

William

This is very useful - thank you.

Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.

To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'.  If we consider the following two examples:

Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order' reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at the target URI.  It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).

Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type communicated by it's current context.  This is the problem, I don't need to 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource.  What I need to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow' header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of method in the 'rel'.

Does that make sense?

Thanks in advance

Paul

&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that link will get you to the next page of the book. 
&gt;

It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad practice.

Having that information, you can start asking that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world knows it.  So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute will tell you everything.

Subject:RE: [rest-discuss] Re: Rel attributes?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Paul,

In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the href.

Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
listed in the app:accept text().

Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia format which is defining what can and can't be
done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again, knowing what @method="POST" means
could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.   It is the shared semantics that allows us to
program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a particular hypermedia construct.

Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the response metadata also declare the available methods.
Message metadata is authoritative.

But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth, and the representation format has already
defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.

&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad practice.
It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".

Cheers,
Peter

William

This is very useful - thank you.

Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.

To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following two examples:

Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order' reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).

Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow' header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of method in the 'rel'.

Does that make sense?

Thanks in advance

Paul

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Rel attributes?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Peter,

Caveat: I am not an ATOM expert, happy to be corrected.

I have investigated the 'edit' link relation previously and concluded that the semantics are confused.

The definition from ATOMPUB is:

"The value of "edit" specifies that the value of the href attribute is the IRI of an editable Member Entry. When appearing within an atom:entry, the href IRI can be used to retrieve, update, and delete the Resource represented by that Entry..."

So, actually 'edit' means GET, PUT, DELETE (in at least one context :-).  We could have a conversation about what 'self' means (a restatement of GET?), but let's park that for a moment.

Then latterly in the Spec there's this, which informs us that the member entry in a feed may not be complete. 

"Clients MUST NOT assume that an Atom Entry returned in the Feed is a full representation of an Entry Resource and SHOULD perform a GET on the URI of the Member Entry before editing it."

This is (at best) annoying for a user-agent which has to either (i) understand the completeness of the member entry in the feed - for which I see no mechanism to determine, or (ii) must always execute a GET, PUT cycle to make a change.  If a GET is required anyway, there are other standard mechanisms to inform the user-agent of the permitted methods (e.g. 'Allow' header).  I consider this part of the spec to somewhat of an over-constraint, and would rather 'edit' was defined as "an intent to do some editing".

Additionally, the conflation of method with rel here gives rise to a considerable number of missing permutations of resource state transition i.e. what about resources I can GET &amp; DELETE but not PUT (does 'edit' still apply?); GET &amp; POST (nothing defined).  Anyway, you get my point I'm sure.

&lt;/rant&gt;

I haven't investigated the app:collection/@href semantics - I'll take a look :-)

I agree the semantics of 'rel' need to be documented in the media type - this is one of the reasons I think we need specific media types for (new) domain problems.  Today's 'special' link relations are the standards of tomorrow - after agreement.

Additionally, the semantics of the link relation can (and do) change with the (current) context of the application, so these context based refinements of rel semantics also need to go in the media type.

So, I'm still on the side that the method and rel should be orthogonal concerns, and that atompub's 'edit' does not help here.

Best regards

Paul

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Paul,

&gt;	So, actually 'edit' means GET, PUT, DELETE (in at least one context :-).  
Fair enough, I did not go back to the spec to quote it, but throw GET in there too.

&gt;We could have a conversation about what 'self' means (a restatement of GET?), but let's park that for a moment.
How did you get here in the first place?  When this representation is taken out of its habitat,
what is it/where did it come from/how can I get a fresh copy?  

&gt;	This is (at best) annoying for a user-agent which has to either (i) understand the completeness of the member entry in the feed - for which I see no mechanism to determine, or 

remember that the collection resource is not the member resource.  So while a feed informs you of its members, it does not guarantee that the entries are complete.  That is REST for you - no guarantees that the representation is the resource.  And anyway, you haven't done a GET on the Member resource, just the Collection, so any Allow header you have received to date is about the Collection resource. 

&gt; (ii) must always execute a GET, PUT cycle to make a change.  If a GET is required anyway, there are other standard mechanisms to inform the user-agent of the permitted methods (e.g. 'Allow' header).
Well of course you would want to do a GET before doing a PUT, unless you don't care what the resource says.  You have a point with Allow, I think.  I think you are arguing that a hypermedia format definition should associate method,rel,type "coordinates".  Am I wrong?

Cheers,
Peter

Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form 
could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over 
time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are 
expected to understand the full form language).

I haved tried to illustrate this in

Hi Paul,

In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the 
href.

Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the 
app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
listed in the app:accept text().

Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia 
format which is defining what can and can't be
done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again, 
knowing what @method="POST" means
could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere 
and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry. 
It is the shared semantics that allows us to
program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a 
particular hypermedia construct.

Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the 
response metadata also declare the available methods.
Message metadata is authoritative.

But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth, 
and the representation format has already
defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find 
the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.

&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource 
&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document. 
&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying 
&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST 
&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad 
&gt; practice.

It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a

William

This is very useful - thank you.

Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of 
'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.

To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble 
at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following 
two examples:

Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order' 
reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at 
the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow 
this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of 
the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).

Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to 
(unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type 
communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to 
'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the 
available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need 
to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow' 
header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of 
method in the 'rel'.

Does that make sense?

Thanks in advance

Paul

&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that 
&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are 
&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual 
&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What 
&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query 
&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it 
&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;
&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a 
&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current 
&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources 
&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that 
&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;
&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource

&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying

&gt; practice.
&gt;
&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are 
&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points 
&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking 
&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST 
&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is 
&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically 
&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;
&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media 
&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. 
&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel 
&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With 
&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;
&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links 
&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an 
&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and 
&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch 
&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional 
&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world 
&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have 
&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute 
&gt; will tell you everything.

&gt; &gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or

&gt; &gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI. 
&gt; &gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation, 
&gt; &gt; then that is even better.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same

&gt; &gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to 
&gt; &gt; have it do something with it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do 
&gt; &gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent 
&gt; &gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is 
&gt; &gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No magic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the

&gt; &gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to 
&gt; &gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server 
&gt; &gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather 
&gt; &gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of 
&gt; &gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing 
&gt; &gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HTH,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jan
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get 
&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something 
&gt; &gt; &gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately 
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look 
&gt; &gt; &gt; like. For example the link:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt; &gt; &gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web 
&gt; &gt; &gt; browser what would you see?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks...

here are two options for a hypermedia affordances in a media type
design that supports writing new and updating existing resources:

&lt;create href="..." &gt;...&lt;/create&gt;
&lt;update href="..."&gt;...&lt;/update&gt;
OR
&lt;write href="..." action="create"&gt;...&lt;/write&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; browser what would you see?

<pre>Both examples allows the server to add new elements without breaking existing clients so both are fine with me. New clients has to look for new stuff anyway - be it as new elements or as new actions/relations. So the same amount of out-of-band knowledge seems to be required.

Personally I prefer the generic &lt;write&gt; since the client won't have to add new parsing capabilities if it already supports collections of named &lt;write&gt; elements.

<pre>Hi Mike,

i guess the second design is easier to evolve by defining more valid action values without breaking the client, which can ignore unknown actions. 

As far as i can see, the out of band knowledge is pretty much the same, isn´t it?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt; &gt; href.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt; &gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt; &gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt; &gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt; &gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt; &gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt; &gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt; &gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt; &gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt; &gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt; &gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt; &gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt; &gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt; &gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt; &gt; and the representation format has already
&gt; &gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt; &gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt; &gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt; &gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt; &gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt; &gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt; &gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt; &gt; two examples:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt; &gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt; &gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt; &gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt; &gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt; &gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt; &gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt; &gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt; &gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt; &gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt; &gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt; &gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does that make sense?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt; &gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt; &gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt; &gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt; &gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt; &gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt; &gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt; &gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt; &gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt; &gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt; &gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt; &gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt; &gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt; &gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt; &gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; practice.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt; &gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt; &gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt; &gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt; &gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt; &gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt; &gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt; &gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt; &gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt; &gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt; &gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt; &gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt; &gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt; &gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt; &gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt; &gt;&gt; will tell you everything.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then that is even better.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have it do something with it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No magic.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to

1. Reply: When you click reply, the messages sender is always the default recipient. Hellloo? it is a group discussion, what should be the default here? Or why not provide at least a "reply all" link? I don´t know how many double posts i received (and sent!) because of that "feature".

2. Help/Feedback: Ever tried to provide feedback to yahoo? Have fun! I was clicking around for 10 minutes until i found something, where i could phrase a question, just to discover, that the FAQ was searched by this phrase. Nice...

3. Design: I don´t know, where to start. Maybe the two search fields? All these little (un)information canapés spread over every page? The layout from the 90ies? 

In a nutshell: These "affordances" make me think to much for a simple discuss group application.

<pre>Hi Mike,

A couple of my replies through the yahoo web interface have gone awol.

Thanks for this.

Both rely on the hypermedia documentation, per Roy's hypermedia-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven post.
The first option is simpler, so it gets my vote, in the absence of a defined use for the extra markup.

Cheers,

&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt;
&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt;
&gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt; and the representation format has already
&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;
&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a
&gt; lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".

&gt;
&gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt;
&gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt; two examples:
&gt;
&gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt;
&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt;
&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt; &gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt; &gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt; &gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt; &gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt; &gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt; &gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt; &gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt; &gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt; &gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt; &gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt; &gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt; &gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt; &gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt; &gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt; &gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt; &gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt; &gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt; &gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; HTH,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Jan
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; browser what would you see?
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks...

&gt; Both rely on the hypermedia documentation, per Roy's hypermedia-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven post.
&gt; The first option is simpler, so it gets my vote, in the absence of a defined use for the extra markup.

&gt; here are two options for a hypermedia affordances in a media type
&gt; design that supports writing new and updating existing resources:

&gt; &lt;create href="..." &gt;...&lt;/create&gt;
&gt; &lt;update href="..."&gt;...&lt;/update&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would say that you can do rel="CreateWithPost" and declare that in the
&gt;&gt; link-rel documentation. But you loose something by doing so: allowing the
&gt;&gt; server to specify HTTP method and payload encoding at runtime (since that
&gt;&gt; knowledge would have to be a hardcoded part of the link-rel knowledge).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form
&gt;&gt; could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over
&gt;&gt; time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are
&gt;&gt; expected to understand the full form language).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I haved tried to illustrate this in
&gt;&gt; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/mtdVPRks_QI/ZEK3_9QBVtoJ -
&gt;&gt; check the "evolving server, stable client" scenarios in example 1, 2 and 3.

&gt;&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt;&gt; href.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt;&gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt;&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; programmed (or configured) to do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; browser what would you see?

<pre>In my opinion it is bad. The server should include http method and payload format (but you only asked to compare the two formats). The client should only know the "action" name and the set of parameters to transfer - it is then left to the server to specify the rest in a form language defined by the media type of the current message.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would say that you can do rel="CreateWithPost" and declare that in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; link-rel documentation. But you loose something by doing so: allowing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; server to specify HTTP method and payload encoding at runtime (since that
&gt; &gt;&gt; knowledge would have to be a hardcoded part of the link-rel knowledge).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form
&gt; &gt;&gt; could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over
&gt; &gt;&gt; time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; expected to understand the full form language).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I haved tried to illustrate this in
&gt; &gt;&gt; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/mtdVPRks_QI/ZEK3_9QBVtoJ -
&gt; &gt;&gt; check the "evolving server, stable client" scenarios in example 1, 2 and 3.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; href.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt; &gt;&gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt; &gt;&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt; &gt;&gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt; &gt;&gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt; &gt;&gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt; &gt;&gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt; &gt;&gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt; &gt;&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt; &gt;&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt; &gt;&gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt; &gt;&gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the representation format has already
&gt; &gt;&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt; &gt;&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt; &gt;&gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt; &gt;&gt; two examples:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt; &gt;&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt; &gt;&gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt; &gt;&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt; &gt;&gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt; &gt;&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt; &gt;&gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt; &gt;&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt; &gt;&gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks in advance

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; then that is even better.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt;&gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt;&gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt;&gt; two examples:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt;&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt;&gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt;&gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt;&gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt;&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt;&gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt;&gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt;&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt;&gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt;&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt;&gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt;&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt;&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt;&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt;&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt;&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt;&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt;&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt;&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt;&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt;&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt;&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt;&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt;&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt;&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt;&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt;&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt;&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HTH,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; browser what would you see?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Both rely on the hypermedia documentation, per Roy's hypermedia-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; browser what would you see?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks...

If i understand your question, the actual mapping of the protocol
details to the message design differs depending on the protocol used.

for an example of a very similar design (list, item, query), check out
this blog post that shows both HTTP and FTP "bindings" for the message
design:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks a lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that you can do rel="CreateWithPost" and declare that in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; link-rel documentation. But you loose something by doing so: allowing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; server to specify HTTP method and payload encoding at runtime (since that
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge would have to be a hardcoded part of the link-rel knowledge).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form
&gt;&gt;&gt; could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over
&gt;&gt;&gt; time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; expected to understand the full form language).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I haved tried to illustrate this in
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/mtdVPRks_QI/ZEK3_9QBVtoJ -
&gt;&gt;&gt; check the "evolving server, stable client" scenarios in example 1, 2 and 3.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; href.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt;&gt;&gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt;&gt;&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt;&gt;&gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt;&gt;&gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt;&gt;&gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt;&gt;&gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt;&gt;&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt;&gt;&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the representation format has already
&gt;&gt;&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt;&gt;&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HTH,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; browser what would you see?

He proposes this[1]:

Tim Berners-Lee suggests reusing the HTML.A tag[2]:
&lt;a name=fig1 href="fghjkdfghj" REL="EMBED, PRESENT"&gt;Figure &lt;/a&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks a lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that you can do rel="CreateWithPost" and declare that in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link-rel documentation. But you loose something by doing so: allowing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; server to specify HTTP method and payload encoding at runtime (since that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge would have to be a hardcoded part of the link-rel knowledge).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected to understand the full form language).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I haved tried to illustrate this in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/mtdVPRks_QI/ZEK3_9QBVtoJ -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; check the "evolving server, stable client" scenarios in example 1, 2 and 3.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the representation format has already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two examples:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; browser what would you see?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

<pre>Jørn:

what i am aiming for is judgement.  as designers of solutions
(architects, programmers, implementors, etc.) we make decisions. we
decide to use one option over another. we decide some set of possible
options are [fill in some word that is more acceptable for you than
"bad" here] and one of the possible options is "good" (or some other
word you find acceptable).

FWIW, what i am after here is to give us all a chance to talk about
our choices. i've not used words like "right" "wrong" here. i've been
careful to use several important words with quote marks around them to
indicate that those words have a qualitative value, not quantitative.
i've provided more than one possible ways to interpret and answer the
questions i pose.

what i am doing here is offering choices that are, essentially,
functional equivalents. some would select one option; some another. i
am asking for ppl to make explicit their choices and help me learn why
they made them.

for me, there is no "right" answer. and every answer is an opportunity
for me to learn.

i hope this helps you understand why i am asking these questions in
this particular way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Both rely on the hypermedia documentation, per Roy's hypermedia-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven post.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The first option is simpler, so it gets my vote, in the absence of a defined use for the extra markup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here are two options for a hypermedia affordances in a media type

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;create href="..." &gt;...&lt;/create&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks a lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that you can do rel="CreateWithPost" and declare that in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link-rel documentation. But you loose something by doing so: allowing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; server to specify HTTP method and payload encoding at runtime (since that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge would have to be a hardcoded part of the link-rel knowledge).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Had the link "Create" instead lead to a form of some kind then the form
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could specifiy HTTP method at runtime, thus letting the server evolve over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time (changing HTTP method) without updating the clients (as they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected to understand the full form language).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I haved tried to illustrate this in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hypermedia-web/mtdVPRks_QI/ZEK3_9QBVtoJ -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; check the "evolving server, stable client" scenarios in example 1, 2 and 3.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In atompub, the rel="edit" link relation means you can PUT or DELETE to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also in atompub, app:collection/accept/text() tells you you can POST the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; app:collection/@href whatever MIME types are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listed in the app:accept text().
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Going by that as an exemplar, it seems to me that it is the hypermedia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; format which is defining what can and can't be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done against the URL.  Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing what @method="POST" means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could be considered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is the shared semantics that allows us to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come across a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular hypermedia construct.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; response metadata also declare the available methods.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the representation format has already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in the instance in which you find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) method availabilities.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don't see why it is a bad practice.  It looks a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot like the atom:link@rel="edit", or html's @method="POST".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is very useful - thank you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I consider the meaning of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'rel' to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaialble
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the target URI) into the meaning of 'rel'. If we consider the following
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two examples:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 1: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/order'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something 'order'-like at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent) to follow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 'order'-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 2: Use of a 'rel' such as 'http://relations.example.com/new' to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communicated by it's current context. This is the problem, I don't need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'say' to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the 'Allow'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method in the 'rel'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I'm in? What is this link referring to? What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel="next" will hint that following that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identified by the link's URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rel="CreateWithPost" to hint the agent to use the link's URI with a POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel="parent" will tell you the links points
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other "link" tags like anchor and image are special links
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you found an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don't expect the link rel attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will tell you everything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel link. I understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for how to interact with the link provider).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beyond 'this is a link'. If you register your rel name in the IANA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. 'next' or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'up'. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then that is even better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sees your link rel value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://foo/customerDetails" ... /&gt; is conceptually the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &lt;link rel="working-copy" .../&gt; and also as HTML's &lt;img src="..."/&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub's &lt;collection href="..."/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it do something with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmed (or configured) to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No magic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn't any control over the server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code can interact with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the book they don't give an example of what a "rel" page would look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like. For example the link:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel="http://relations.restbucks.com/payment"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; href:="http://restbucks.com/payment/1234" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you typed in "http://relations.restbucks.com/payment" into your web
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; browser what would you see?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Subject:ATOM Pub vs. JSON vs. ...?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Folks;

I am at the moment into trying to choose a data format / representation 
to use for building a RESTful web service which should allow for reading 
and writing resources, which should be accessible using "standard" tools 
as well as using a dedicated programming API and which should as much as 
somewhat possible rely upon existing open standards.

After doing some reading, I came across Atom and APP as it seems in many 
possible ways provide sane and stable solutions for problems at hand 
(including things like "workspaces", "feeds", "entries", dealing with 
service and category descriptions, dealing with textual and binary 
content, dealing with extensibility and stuff like OpenSearch and the 
like).

In many ways, so far it seems the perfect match, however it right now 
(at least for me) suffers from a particular shortcoming: I am not really 
sure whether it's a technology or a standard to "last". Doing some 
reading on that, I rather quickly stumbled across articles pointing out 
that "AtomPub has failed" and "AtomPub is basically dead", suggesting 
that everyone else uses JSON based REST services right now, eventually 
pointing out that even the Google GData services are considered "legacy" 
and replaced by different approaches right now. On the other hand I 
don't really see what could replace Atom or especially AtomPub talking 
about providing a given data structure, a data and service semantics to 
allow for read/write interactions with a service in a somewhat sane, 
standard way.

So to ask: If you were about to start a new RESTful project supposed to 
work with existing "standard" tools, what kind of data representation 
would you choose? Would you still go for Atom / AtomPub? Would you 
rather use some kind of JSON+HTTP? Something completely else?

Thanks in advance for any input,
Kristian

<pre>Hi Kristian,

I think one of the major problems with Atom/APP is that it was too
specific to become a 'general-use' media type- there are many
resources and applications that do not fit into a collection and item
mode and so 'standard' tooling that is built on top of it is only
applicable in specific circumstances - which limits the tools'
value/utility.

I believe if we take a different approach whereby the fundamental
model of a generic media type is based around resources (_not_
collections) then we can better develop tooling that will be more
generally aplicable, and more likely to be adopted on the whole.

I took these ideas and created a couple of media types hal+json and
hal+xml that are designed on that basis. They allow you to model your
application in terms of resources and links, and will make your app
consumable from a number of open source libraries. You can read more
about them here if you are interested:

<pre>no matter the assessments of the "success" or "failure" of Atom/APP, it's
not going away any time soon. If the data format and message semantics work
for your use case, I would not hesitate to use it in your implementation.

Other media type designs that you might want to check out are HAL[1]
and Collection+JSON[2]. Both aim at similar space and have markedly
different approaches.

<pre>Hey Kristian,

AtomPub is awesome!  Go for it.  Nothing stops you from using
content negotiation to provide other formats within the scope of your
service.

Just remember that when you extend it with
your own markup, you should use appropriate message metadata / extended
MIME media types you use to encompass your extensions.

Peter

Well actually, despite knowing there actually always will be some 
differences in "mapping" a custom data semantics to an existing one, I 
figured out that, in our given use case, the concepts of Atom and APP 
both fit better than any other approach I found so far, and, then again, 
seem to be backed by sufficient support (frameworks, documentation, 
tools out there) to eventually provide a reliable foundation being a 
"primary representation" in a prototype system that doesn't want to come 
up with a custom / proprietary API which essentially wouldn't do much 
more than re-inventing things like workspaces, feeds, entries, 
categories (one of the things about Atom that definitely got me 
enthusiastic about it when I started dealing with it) or representations 
accepted when POSTing things to a certain resource.

So far, my only real doubt here was, after reading through all the posts 
I found out there, that Atom / APP might not be "state of the art" here 
anymore. AFAICT, most of the frameworks and librares I stumbled across 
(in the Java/Java EE world) seem not to have seen major updates in a 
while. I simply wouldn't like to do an up-front design of a new system 
built upon something obsolete in the beginning. So far, your comments 
have merely convinced me that going with Atom / APP seems a good 
starting point initially.


&gt; Other media type designs that you might want to check out are HAL[1]
&gt; and Collection+JSON[2]. Both aim at similar space and have markedly
&gt; different approaches.
&gt;
&gt; [1] http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html
&gt; [2] http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/

Thanks very much for the pointers. I'll have a look for sure and see 
whether one of these (or both) might come in at least as an alternative 
representation usable by clients that can't / don't want to work with 
Atom. At first sight, especially HAL seems promising; curious to work 
with this a bit. :)

Thanks again, all the best!

Well yes; yet I see people who deal with REST hardly dealing with Atom / 
APP. Most of the times indeed it ends up being some proprietary XML or, 
more likely, some JSON media type being considered "better suited", less 
overhead to deal with, easier to deliver custom data structures. What 
they don't usually say (or see, for that matter) is that, ultimately, 
again it ends up with systems which seem somewhat tightly coupled, 
JavaScript code in the browser or (even worse) external applications 
depending upon a custom data structure which might or might not be 
required to undergo more or less fundamental changes all along the way. 
 From that point of view, I still consider Atom / APP a good thing 
because it provides a bit more standards-based convention on how to 
handle things in a portable, interoperable way. So, at the very least I 
hope some more of its concepts will be likely to make it into things 
like HAL, Collection+JSON, ...  - or concepts derived from these make it 
into a successor to the current Atom / APP specs if there are any. :)

Kristian

<pre>Hi Indresh,

sorry if I wasn't clear. My intention was not to find issues to APP. I
wanted to tackle the fact that APP was not trendy because the reason that
makes APP awesome is the part in REST that is misunderstood. APP uses XML
which sounds old for some. At least it is true in my entourage, which is
mainly composed of young web developers. That is a constatation, but
personally I would advocates APP, but I haven't work enough with it yet.

If in your case you want to publish notifications, maybe you should
consider only using Atom instead of AtomPub?

In my case, I wasn't sure if APP was the right choice. But trying to
express it within the constraints of APP just opened new horizon. I
preferred to keep going with APP because of the  properties it induces in
my architecture. Instead of bending the protocol to what I thought was my
needs, I decided to harmonize with it by slightly revising my "needs".

Spoken like someone who understood Roy's thesis.  What's perfect may
not be what's best. And, what already has high cache retention provides
immediate benefit that's unlikely to diminish, which newer options
won't be able to equal until some nebulous point in the future.  The
bandwagon may have passed Atom by, but I've never heard of it being de-
allowed on intermediaries already configured for it; thus it is neither
obsolete, nor without its advantages.

Heheh... don't get me started.  ;-)  I still think this is the most
important, and least-understood, concept in all of REST:

"The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades
efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form
rather than one which is specific to an application's needs. The REST
interface is designed to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data
transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in
an interface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural
interaction."

If you can model your system as one of hypertext documents, then you
don't need to make design tradeoffs in the name of less overhead, which
tend to negate the benefits of REST.  So, I say go for it with Atom.

Maybe I'm just grumpy because yet another website I frequent now
features a broken back button, paging back through script after script
until finally, on the 4th or 5th click, user intent is finally
respected.  Or, because I can no longer right-click Google results to
copy an URL, or any number of proliferating faults which break the Web
by going against the "natural" architecture which are making it *less*
usable and accessible, thanks to gratuitous use of JS.

Also sounds like someone who understood Roy's thesis.  Although I'd say
it's more about designing your system as hypertext documents, rather
than Atom/APP specifically; working within the idiom of REST should
result in a system where media type is a bike-shed color which can be
content-negotiated.

Well, off-heart I guess we're not "traditional" hypermedia, we couldn't 
be less than that. We live off providing hosted, managed document 
management services for construction sites. However, I found that in 
many respects hypermedia concepts apply to the way we keep track of our 
document structures, as well. There are different customer projects. 
Workspaces. There are different groups of documents (drawings, photo 
documentation, lists, ...) inside each project (feeds), each of them 
allow for read/write access, though the latter usually limited to 
certain media types (PDF/HPGL/DWF for drawing layouts, JPG for images, 
PDF for virtually everything else). We have to keep track of what we see 
the "content" of a document (structured key/value metadata) and 1..n 
alternate representations (like a drawing which we have to keep three 
equivalent files of - HPGL, PDF, DWF). We have human-readable summaries 
(usually used by humans in order to tell what kind of document it is), 
creation / change dates, we have authors and different versions and the 
whole load. We have documents mainly sorted by key/value attributes, 
values being based upon predefined catalogs. Atom categories. That's 
what we eventually got. We need, in most cases, data exchange with 
systems which are "external" from our point of view. Document management 
installations at our customers sites. Competing application service 
providers. In all cases, it eventually boils down to transfering 
document content (metadata + files) periodically, polling and fetching 
what is new.

I spent less than a few hours late one evening diving through some 
articles on Atom and repeatedly saw our use cases covered rather well by 
what Atom and APP provides. No, we're not a weblog provider or a news 
aggregator, but in some ways Atom and APP seems to make sense 
technically. Sure, it partially _is_ mapping our stuff to Atom/APP, but 
in the end we, well, end up with an external interface relying upon 
well-known technologies adhering to well-known semantics rather than 
re-inventing the same wheel in a slightly different way in SOAP like so 
many does. I then and now enjoy using SOAP, same as I did using CORBA 
before, but for this kind of purpose (exchanging information between 
different sites where anything else than the systems being loosely 
coupled is totally illusionary), things just get overly painful while 
manually crafting a custom media type. Did this using JSON in an early 
prototype, and learnt enough off this to want it really done with 
standards used more widespread when going productive. So far, it seems 
Atom/APP as primary media type, backed by HAL+JSON or the like as an 
alternative, seems a sane way here.


&gt; Maybe I'm just grumpy because yet another website I frequent now
&gt; features a broken back button, paging back through script after script
&gt; until finally, on the 4th or 5th click, user intent is finally

Know what you mean. Then and now was hoping this behaviour would 
eventually be gone one day, but it seems it's still here to stay. :/

using diff tools to compare local files and then POSTing the output
content to a collection; etc.

The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client
environment executables files restfully?

I need to access the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it
fail any constraints the fact that the CLI would try to access the
diff executable tools under the hood? I would provide to the consumer
the hypermedia controls necessary to fill in the arguments that will
be passed to the executables. Just like HTML forms. What about
code-on-demand instead? The client would executes, as an example,
shell scripting fragment depending on the client environment setup
capabilities. Just like the browser executes JavaScript? It has some
advantages that the client could be partly able to update itself.

Otherwise I would need to let the server do the diff which will be
retrieve by the client. But the client and the server will most of the
time be on the same machine or local network. The client needs to
access the file system and do operations on files, which the local web
server could do.

Any advices? Thanks.

you are right, I have to make decisions in what concerns the
architecture of my client but that is not REST related. But I don't
know at which level it is important or not that the consumer of the
user agent knows about those details.

if by "consumer of the user agent" you mean a _person_, it's always good to
let them know what your app "touches", depends upon, etc.

Subject:REST "create if not exists"<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello

I'm new to REST, and I'm trying to integrate it in my company. We
currently are trying to design a multi-criteria search engine with REST
principles. I use as a reference the O'Reilly "RESTful Web Services".

I don't know if the following problem has been discussed somewhere, but
I've been unable to find anything that matches it. If you happen to know
resources that could help me, please let me know.

In a multi-critera search engine, we have two types of resources :
"Results" and "Filters". Results are items searched for, and Filters are
sets of criteria which allows us to isolate a subset of Results.

For example :

     GET /results returns the total number of results
     GET /results/{result-id} returns one specific result
     GET /filters returns a specification on criteria usage (eg. an empty
&lt;form&gt;)
     GET /filters/{filter-id} returns one specific filter (eg. a filled
&lt;form&gt;)
     GET /filters/{filter-id}/results returns the total number of results
matching the filter, and links to the corresponding /results/{result-id}

We want to allow the registration of filters. Imagine a filter as the
composition of 3 criteria, c1, c2 and c3. My first thought was to
register a filter through a POST request.

     Request :

     POST /filters HTTP/1.1

     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz

     Response :

     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
     Location: /filters/123456

But if I (or someone else) do it again, I'll end up with another
{filter-id}, e.g. 123457. Then we'll have two resources with the exact
same meaning and content.

If I want to use one URI for one criteria set, PUT seems more
appropriate. The thing is, the {filter-id} is assigned "randomly" by the
server. As a client, I can't guess nor force it. From there, I see the
following solutions, neither I find satisfying :

1/ I try to map artificially my URIs to the criteria set. I could use a
hash of the representation. e.g. :

     Request :

     PUT /filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53 HTTP/1.1

     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz

     Response :

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK

     &lt;form method="PUT"
action="/filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53"&gt;
         &lt;input name="c1" value="foo" /&gt;
         &lt;input name="c2" value="bar" /&gt;
         &lt;input name="c3" value="baz" /&gt;
         &lt;input type="submit" /&gt;
     &lt;/form&gt;

The problem is : it is artificial. If my criteria set changes, or if its
representation changes, I could end up with conflicts or doubles.

2/ I trick the client into believing it actually created something new,
whether or not it has. This means, even if /filters/123456 already
exists, my server will answer it to anyone POSTing the
"c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz" content.

The problem is : it's a fraud. Only the initial POST really "appends"
something.

3/ I answer the second-and-further POST requests with a "409 Conflict"
answer, and the correct location.

The problem is : it is not actually an error. The client doesn't care to
register something, it just has no way to know wheter or not the
resource he is looking for already exists.

4/ I do a preliminary check

     Request :

     GET /filters?c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz HTTP/1.1

     Response :

     HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
     Location: /filters/123456

The problem is : If the resource doesn't exists at that time, I'll be
willing to create it. If I do, nothing ensures me that someone hasn't
created it inbetween. Then, if I want to put aside a location for my
resource, it implies my GET isn't safe anymore.

5/ The last option I see is that the URI should contains the whole
content of the resource, as it is its "natural" identifier. This is
especially difficult if I have a large set of criteria, and if their
values are complex. This is why we use ids in the first place.

Thanks in advance for your help

François

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] How a CLI could use the client environment executables files?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>When I'm thinking of coding a user agent that run in the shell
environment, I'm thinking of parsing the representation media-type
that I would like to have "by default". The reason is that it seems
practical to have a single media-type for a representation I could use
for different user agent technologies, such as a browser. I just feel
that something may be wrong by sending atom feeds to my command line
client if I want a plain text representation.

I'm thinking about defining a new media-type specialized for the shell
environment. Let's call it "application/console" for now. What I think
could be useful for the command line user agent is having hyper media
controls, for now just links and forms, separate from the text version
of a representation. Instead of having an interactive console, just as
the well known lynx or links browsers command line tool, the shell
prompt would return between every request. That mean that you would
have access to your shell. Links for forms from the plain text
representation would be map to numbers and those numbers would be
reset at every state transitions to reflect the new possible state
transitions. It is kind of semi-interactive tool which I think is well
suited for command line work flow.

Let's see a possible use case.
Let's call the tool "foo"
The lines beginning with # is what could happen under the hood.

$ foo http://example.org
# GET /
# Accept: application/console
Hello, here is what you could do from here:
[1]: Read the FAQ
[2]: Search for documents

$ foo 1
# Get /faq
# Accept: application/console
[1]: Back to homepage
Q. two + two
A. four
Q. Where can I find help?
A. Right here

$ foo 1
# Get /
# Accept: application/console
[1]: Read the FAQ
[2]: Search for documents

$ ls -a
# Just a reminder that you have full access to the shell, the client
state is saved
foo.txt ./ ../

$ foo 2
Type the name of the document you want to search:
# Waiting for user input ... and suppose the user type RFC5023 and press enter
# GET /search?query=RFC5023
# Accept: application/console
The Atom Publishing Protocol

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
   ...

The "text/plain" media type couldn't be used because of the hypermedia
controls would need to be sent along the text representation, but not
mixed with the text, just in another section.

I would really like to have your comments on this idea and the
possible need for a new media-type "application/console". Please let
me know if I'm thinking of it wrong and tell me if something was not
clear.

Thanks,

First, I highly recommend you check out the "RESTful Web Services
Cookbook"[1]. It's full of very solid examples of solving problems /w HTTP.
Second, you have quite a bit in this message and I'll only address some
top-level items here.
Third, FWIW, all your Qs seem to be related to the HTTP protocol, not
Fielding's REST style; not a probem, just an observation.

- "We want to allow the registration of filters."
Your example of creating filters looks fine here.

- "But if I (or someone else) do it again, I'll end up with another
{filter-id}, e.g. 123457. Then we'll have two resources with the exact same
meaning and content."
And why is this a problem? does it crash your server? cause you to run out
of storage? return bad results? cause business rules to go awry? I suspect
you want to _optimize-out_ this seeming duplication. FWIW, I find it quite
difficult to _prevent_ duplication in a distributed system and I only
attempt it when it will crash the system or cause incorrect results. If two
of the thousands of users I have in my system both store the same filter,
results, list of groceries to purchase this weekend, I rarely care.

I think most of the rest of your post here is dedicated to attempting
something incredibly creative in order to prevent something extremely
common&lt;g&gt;.

&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I'm new to REST, and I'm trying to integrate it in my company. We
&gt; currently are trying to design a multi-criteria search engine with REST
&gt; principles. I use as a reference the O'Reilly "RESTful Web Services".
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if the following problem has been discussed somewhere, but
&gt; I've been unable to find anything that matches it. If you happen to know
&gt; resources that could help me, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt; In a multi-critera search engine, we have two types of resources :
&gt; "Results" and "Filters". Results are items searched for, and Filters are
&gt; sets of criteria which allows us to isolate a subset of Results.
&gt;
&gt; For example :
&gt;
&gt;     GET /results returns the total number of results
&gt;     GET /results/{result-id} returns one specific result
&gt;     GET /filters returns a specification on criteria usage (eg. an empty
&gt; &lt;form&gt;)
&gt;     GET /filters/{filter-id} returns one specific filter (eg. a filled
&gt; &lt;form&gt;)
&gt;     GET /filters/{filter-id}/results returns the total number of results
&gt; matching the filter, and links to the corresponding /results/{result-id}
&gt;
&gt; We want to allow the registration of filters. Imagine a filter as the
&gt; composition of 3 criteria, c1, c2 and c3. My first thought was to register
&gt; a filter through a POST request.
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     POST /filters HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
&gt;     Location: /filters/123456
&gt;
&gt; But if I (or someone else) do it again, I'll end up with another
&gt; {filter-id}, e.g. 123457. Then we'll have two resources with the exact same
&gt; meaning and content.
&gt;
&gt; If I want to use one URI for one criteria set, PUT seems more appropriate.
&gt; The thing is, the {filter-id} is assigned "randomly" by the server. As a
&gt; client, I can't guess nor force it. From there, I see the following
&gt; solutions, neither I find satisfying :
&gt;
&gt; 1/ I try to map artificially my URIs to the criteria set. I could use a
&gt; hash of the representation. e.g. :
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     PUT /filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53 HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&gt;
&gt;     &lt;form method="PUT" action="/filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c1" value="foo" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c2" value="bar" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c3" value="baz" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input type="submit" /&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it is artificial. If my criteria set changes, or if its
&gt; representation changes, I could end up with conflicts or doubles.
&gt;
&gt; 2/ I trick the client into believing it actually created something new,
&gt; whether or not it has. This means, even if /filters/123456 already exists,
&gt; my server will answer it to anyone POSTing the "c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz"
&gt; content.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it's a fraud. Only the initial POST really "appends"
&gt; something.
&gt;
&gt; 3/ I answer the second-and-further POST requests with a "409 Conflict"
&gt; answer, and the correct location.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it is not actually an error. The client doesn't care to
&gt; register something, it just has no way to know wheter or not the resource
&gt; he is looking for already exists.
&gt;
&gt; 4/ I do a preliminary check
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     GET /filters?c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
&gt;     Location: /filters/123456
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : If the resource doesn't exists at that time, I'll be
&gt; willing to create it. If I do, nothing ensures me that someone hasn't
&gt; created it inbetween. Then, if I want to put aside a location for my
&gt; resource, it implies my GET isn't safe anymore.
&gt;
&gt; 5/ The last option I see is that the URI should contains the whole content
&gt; of the resource, as it is its "natural" identifier. This is especially
&gt; difficult if I have a large set of criteria, and if their values are
&gt; complex. This is why we use ids in the first place.

I think the notion of a hypermedia console experience is a fine one; I've
cobbled a few together in the past (including using numbers to shortcut the
human selection process).

FWIW, I don't think you MUST invent a new media type for this (even though
you MAY want to anyway). I've done this using HTML in the past; even once
worked up a CSV style that included hypermedia controls (kinda wonky, but
it was fun).

&gt; When I'm thinking of coding a user agent that run in the shell

&gt; for different user agent technologies, such as a browser. I just feel
&gt; that something may be wrong by sending atom feeds to my command line
&gt; client if I want a plain text representation.
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking about defining a new media-type specialized for the shell
&gt; environment. Let's call it "application/console" for now. What I think
&gt; could be useful for the command line user agent is having hyper media
&gt; controls, for now just links and forms, separate from the text version
&gt; of a representation. Instead of having an interactive console, just as
&gt; the well known lynx or links browsers command line tool, the shell
&gt; prompt would return between every request. That mean that you would
&gt; have access to your shell. Links for forms from the plain text
&gt; representation would be map to numbers and those numbers would be
&gt; reset at every state transitions to reflect the new possible state
&gt; transitions. It is kind of semi-interactive tool which I think is well
&gt; suited for command line work flow.
&gt;
&gt; Let's see a possible use case.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sounds like an interesting project.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; first, the REST style focuses primarily on the network-level software
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; details; the implementation within the servers and clients is left
&gt; open
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your own choices.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, Chapter 1 of Fielding's dissertation does a good job of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; describing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the primary software model he had in mind esp. section 1.2[1]. I think
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'll find some guidance there and see that your idea of using
&gt; internal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; components on the client (i.e. diff, etc.) is well within the scope of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; implementation w/ REST characteristics.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to code my own atompub client and server. I use atompub
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to expose different hierarchical collections of members.I would like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the client being an interactive command line tool. Additionally to be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used as a feed reader, a consumer of the CLI would probably use it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for: bookmarking a collection; refreshing bookmarked collections;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using diff tools to compare local files and then POSTing the output
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; content to a collection; etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; environment executables files restfully?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I need to access the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fail any constraints the fact that the CLI would try to access the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diff executable tools under the hood? I would provide to the consumer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the hypermedia controls necessary to fill in the arguments that will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be passed to the executables. Just like HTML forms. What about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; code-on-demand instead? The client would executes, as an example,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shell scripting fragment depending on the client environment setup
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capabilities. Just like the browser executes JavaScript? It has some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advantages that the client could be partly able to update itself.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Otherwise I would need to let the server do the diff which will be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; retrieve by the client. But the client and the server will most of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time be on the same machine or local network. The client needs to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; access the file system and do operations on files, which the local
&gt; web
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; server could do.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any advices? Thanks.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi François,

I would go for #5 if possible. If you don't need to store and/or manipulate filters as independent resources, you'll benefit getting them out of your resource space, as this will vastly simplify your system.

Now, instead of GET  /filters/{filter-id}/results you would do GET /results?c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz. If your filters needs to be more complex than a simple set of key/values, you can create a little syntax to express them; e.g. : GET /results?filter=c1%3Dfoo%20ANDc2%3Dbar%20OR%20c3%3Dbaz.

If you can't do that (maybe your filters are too long to fit in a URL (but this probably isn't the case)), and if for some reason you absolutely need to not have multiple URLs for identical filters, you should go for your solution #2. The problem you see about it isn't a real one. This isn't a fraud, as the meaning of POST isn't necessarily to append something, but can be as generic as "Providing a block of data to a data-handling process".

Best,

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Thanks Mike for taking of your time.

The interesting part in creating a new media-type such as
"application/console" is that I was considering coding a generic user
agent specialized in that media-type. Just as browsers are specialized
in "text/html". I liked that I could use the user agent for my own
project and that it can be easily reused by others to provide out of
the box "hypermedia console experience" as you coined.

What bring me to this idea is that the command line agent only need a
small subset of the metadata if it would parse "application/atom+xml".
By example the app:author element which includes FOAF information. On
the command line side I don't need it, I only need to display the

A feature I wanted to have on the command line, was to open the
current representation in a browser. The href value of any self link
would be pass as argument to the browser executable file. So you could
display a richer view with a richer user agent easily. Does it justify
the need of "application/console"? I would think yes but maybe they
are some cons that I don't foresee. Such as not taking advantage of
the cache by having two media types for the same representation.

I think I'll do the same as the other folks for now by parsing XTML on
the command line agent.

&gt; was fun).

&gt;&gt; When I'm thinking of coding a user agent that run in the shell
&gt;&gt; environment, I'm thinking of parsing the representation media-type
&gt;&gt; that I would like to have "by default". The reason is that it seems
&gt;&gt; practical to have a single media-type for a representation I could use
&gt;&gt; for different user agent technologies, such as a browser. I just feel
&gt;&gt; that something may be wrong by sending atom feeds to my command line
&gt;&gt; client if I want a plain text representation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about defining a new media-type specialized for the shell
&gt;&gt; environment. Let's call it "application/console" for now. What I think
&gt;&gt; could be useful for the command line user agent is having hyper media
&gt;&gt; controls, for now just links and forms, separate from the text version
&gt;&gt; of a representation. Instead of having an interactive console, just as
&gt;&gt; the well known lynx or links browsers command line tool, the shell
&gt;&gt; prompt would return between every request. That mean that you would
&gt;&gt; have access to your shell. Links for forms from the plain text
&gt;&gt; representation would be map to numbers and those numbers would be
&gt;&gt; reset at every state transitions to reflect the new possible state
&gt;&gt; transitions. It is kind of semi-interactive tool which I think is well
&gt;&gt; suited for command line work flow.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let's see a possible use case.
&gt;&gt; Let's call the tool "foo"
&gt;&gt; The lines beginning with # is what could happen under the hood.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; $ foo http://example.org

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sounds like an interesting project.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; first, the REST style focuses primarily on the network-level software
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; details; the implementation within the servers and clients is left
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; open

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, Chapter 1 of Fielding's dissertation does a good job of

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'll find some guidance there and see that your idea of using
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; internal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; components on the client (i.e. diff, etc.) is well within the scope

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to code my own atompub client and server. I use atompub
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to expose different hierarchical collections of members.I would like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the client being an interactive command line tool. Additionally to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used as a feed reader, a consumer of the CLI would probably use it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for: bookmarking a collection; refreshing bookmarked collections;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using diff tools to compare local files and then POSTing the output
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; content to a collection; etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; environment executables files restfully?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I need to access the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fail any constraints the fact that the CLI would try to access the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diff executable tools under the hood? I would provide to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consumer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the hypermedia controls necessary to fill in the arguments that will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be passed to the executables. Just like HTML forms. What about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; code-on-demand instead? The client would executes, as an example,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shell scripting fragment depending on the client environment setup
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capabilities. Just like the browser executes JavaScript? It has some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advantages that the client could be partly able to update itself.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Otherwise I would need to let the server do the diff which will be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; retrieve by the client. But the client and the server will most of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time be on the same machine or local network. The client needs to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; access the file system and do operations on files, which the local
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; web
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; server could do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any advices? Thanks.

&gt; The interesting part in creating a new media-type such as
&gt; "application/console" is that I was considering coding a generic user
&gt; agent specialized in that media-type. Just as browsers are specialized
&gt; in "text/html". I liked that I could use the user agent for my own
&gt; project and that it can be easily reused by others to provide out of
&gt; the box "hypermedia console experience" as you coined.
&gt;
&gt; What bring me to this idea is that the command line agent only need a
&gt; small subset of the metadata if it would parse "application/atom+xml".
&gt; By example the app:author element which includes FOAF information. On
&gt; the command line side I don't need it, I only need to display the
&gt; email.
&gt;
&gt; A feature I wanted to have on the command line, was to open the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to code my own atompub client and server. I use
&gt; atompub
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to expose different hierarchical collections of members.I would
&gt; like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the client being an interactive command line tool. Additionally to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used as a feed reader, a consumer of the CLI would probably use it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for: bookmarking a collection; refreshing bookmarked collections;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using diff tools to compare local files and then POSTing the
&gt; output
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; content to a collection; etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; environment executables files restfully?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I need to access the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fail any constraints the fact that the CLI would try to access the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diff executable tools under the hood? I would provide to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consumer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the hypermedia controls necessary to fill in the arguments that
&gt; will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be passed to the executables. Just like HTML forms. What about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; code-on-demand instead? The client would executes, as an example,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shell scripting fragment depending on the client environment setup
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capabilities. Just like the browser executes JavaScript? It has
&gt; some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advantages that the client could be partly able to update itself.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Otherwise I would need to let the server do the diff which will be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; retrieve by the client. But the client and the server will most of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time be on the same machine or local network. The client needs to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; access the file system and do operations on files, which the local
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; web
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; server could do.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any advices? Thanks.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Thanks all for your answers.

I have added the "cookbook" to my list just after posting this message, and
I'll be buying it this week.

As for the multiple advices here, I'll take them all. I'm not sure exactly
what solution I'll finally get along with, but my question was more about
understanding what makes the options valid or not. I'm glad you provided
many distincts answers, and maybe, depending on the cases (as it seemed
quite a common problem to me) I'll be using either one solution or the
other.

To answer the duplication issue, it occured to me that it may not be
necessary. To be precise, the current system handles "grocery lists"
duplicates :) But there are a lot of recordings, and I'm wondering if
duplication doesn't prevents us from having statistics. If I treat the
resource as "descriptive data", then I can duplicate them. But identifying
each resource as unique would help knowing, for example, which filters are
the most common.

There is also another motivation : we have process running over those
filters, that create notifications when a new result matches the filters.
Reducing the number of filters will reduce the amount of time to process
notifications as well.

Then, thanks to you all, it is more clear in my head now :)

&gt; Hi François,
&gt;
&gt; I would go for #5 if possible. If you don't need to store and/or
&gt; manipulate filters as independent resources, you'll benefit getting them
&gt; out of your resource space, as this will vastly simplify your system.
&gt;
&gt; Now, instead of GET  /filters/{filter-id}/results you would do GET
&gt; /results?c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz. If your filters needs to be more complex
&gt; than a simple set of key/values, you can create a little syntax to express
&gt; them; e.g. : GET /results?filter=c1%3Dfoo%20ANDc2%3Dbar%20OR%20c3%3Dbaz.
&gt;
&gt; If you can't do that (maybe your filters are too long to fit in a URL (but
&gt; this probably isn't the case)), and if for some reason you absolutely need
&gt; to not have multiple URLs for identical filters, you should go for your
&gt; solution #2. The problem you see about it isn't a real one. This isn't a
&gt; fraud, as the meaning of POST isn't necessarily to append something, but
&gt; can be as generic as "Providing a block of data to a data-handling process".
&gt;
&gt; Best,

&gt;
&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I'm new to REST, and I'm trying to integrate it in my company. We
&gt; currently are trying to design a multi-criteria search engine with REST
&gt; principles. I use as a reference the O'Reilly "RESTful Web Services".
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if the following problem has been discussed somewhere, but
&gt; I've been unable to find anything that matches it. If you happen to know
&gt; resources that could help me, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt; In a multi-critera search engine, we have two types of resources :
&gt; "Results" and "Filters". Results are items searched for, and Filters are
&gt; sets of criteria which allows us to isolate a subset of Results.
&gt;
&gt; For example :
&gt;
&gt;     GET /results returns the total number of results
&gt;     GET /results/{result-id} returns one specific result
&gt;     GET /filters returns a specification on criteria usage (eg. an empty
&gt; &lt;form&gt;)
&gt;     GET /filters/{filter-id} returns one specific filter (eg. a filled
&gt; &lt;form&gt;)
&gt;     GET /filters/{filter-id}/results returns the total number of results
&gt; matching the filter, and links to the corresponding /results/{result-id}
&gt;
&gt; We want to allow the registration of filters. Imagine a filter as the
&gt; composition of 3 criteria, c1, c2 and c3. My first thought was to register
&gt; a filter through a POST request.
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     POST /filters HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
&gt;     Location: /filters/123456
&gt;
&gt; But if I (or someone else) do it again, I'll end up with another
&gt; {filter-id}, e.g. 123457. Then we'll have two resources with the exact same
&gt; meaning and content.
&gt;
&gt; If I want to use one URI for one criteria set, PUT seems more appropriate.
&gt; The thing is, the {filter-id} is assigned "randomly" by the server. As a
&gt; client, I can't guess nor force it. From there, I see the following
&gt; solutions, neither I find satisfying :
&gt;
&gt; 1/ I try to map artificially my URIs to the criteria set. I could use a
&gt; hash of the representation. e.g. :
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     PUT /filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53 HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&gt;
&gt;     &lt;form method="PUT" action="/filters/53c11504ba50e14b60407b13a72c0e53"&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c1" value="foo" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c2" value="bar" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input name="c3" value="baz" /&gt;
&gt;         &lt;input type="submit" /&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it is artificial. If my criteria set changes, or if its
&gt; representation changes, I could end up with conflicts or doubles.
&gt;
&gt; 2/ I trick the client into believing it actually created something new,
&gt; whether or not it has. This means, even if /filters/123456 already exists,
&gt; my server will answer it to anyone POSTing the "c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz"
&gt; content.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it's a fraud. Only the initial POST really "appends"
&gt; something.
&gt;
&gt; 3/ I answer the second-and-further POST requests with a "409 Conflict"
&gt; answer, and the correct location.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : it is not actually an error. The client doesn't care to
&gt; register something, it just has no way to know wheter or not the resource
&gt; he is looking for already exists.
&gt;
&gt; 4/ I do a preliminary check
&gt;
&gt;     Request :
&gt;
&gt;     GET /filters?c1=foo&amp;c2=bar&amp;c3=baz HTTP/1.1
&gt;
&gt;     Response :
&gt;
&gt;     HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
&gt;     Location: /filters/123456
&gt;
&gt; The problem is : If the resource doesn't exists at that time, I'll be
&gt; willing to create it. If I do, nothing ensures me that someone hasn't
&gt; created it inbetween. Then, if I want to put aside a location for my
&gt; resource, it implies my GET isn't safe anymore.
&gt;
&gt; 5/ The last option I see is that the URI should contains the whole content
&gt; of the resource, as it is its "natural" identifier. This is especially
&gt; difficult if I have a large set of criteria, and if their values are
&gt; complex. This is why we use ids in the first place.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi  François,

I'm addressing the *duplicate filters* issue from tha standpoint of user
interaction, which is what I do.
Not having that much information about your system, I´m free to guess so I
think the application and the users are regular.

The filters thing might is used by some teams to endorse some of their
responsabilities on the users. Especially, teams dominated by IT engineers
(like me).
We think *"this will allow them to do any query"* with emphasis in the word
"any".
Actually, non-IT people frequently can't do any query. What is simple to
us, like writing a boolean expression, requires a mindset that made us IT
guys. Non-IT people lack that mindset (have diverse mindsets) and thus they
can't translate a natural language requirement into an algebraic statement.
The typical example is a query for all people in Texas AND New York, doomed
to return zero items (we say TX and NY en English, but TX or NY in
boolean). That said, back to subject.

What I'm willing to communicate is that queries and filters have to be
written by IT people, on behalf of user's needs. This requires a previous
work to detect what the users really need, in order to provide them a
solution engineered by a pro. It might have to be a permanent task, albeit
once the users have what they want this tends to be quite stable.

Users can identify queries and filters by natural language descriptive
names, like "Monday morning events" or "Cash movements greater than $3333".
Not "123456".
Let them see a list of query/filter names where thay can choose, and
provide a "new" action so the boolean-savvy users can do their magic. Be
prepared to see few of these.

Users don't usually speak SQL or Boolean Algebra. They also don't speak
REST.
They don't want to, and they shouldn't need to, having IT pros around.

As a twist, I'd like to suggest (if your application is such that you
expect the users to do filters by the meny thousands) the implementation of
a normalization algorithm th reduce queries to a *signature *such as that
of OO methods in order to be able to recognize duplicates automatically and
merge them in statistics without any user involvement.

Notably I mention about normalizing the payload and then simply redirecting
to an existing filter.

Another concept, on top of this, is to let the users name filters.

This way you have two different domains. One is simply canonical filters
that represent specific queries, while the other is conceptual filters that
meet specific needs regardless of the actual criteria involved "Most
popular users in the last month" for example, where that definition perhaps
changes over time.

Subject:Is it correct to respond with partial representation for low capabilities media-types?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

would it be correct for an application to provide partial resource
representation when providing a certain media-type?

My use case is that I have a user agent which don't have any
formatting capabilities nor metadata capabilities. Would it be correct
to "reserve" a specific media-type for that type of user agent so my
application can skip the generation of a bunch of markup and metadata
as a representation? And sometimes the reason is just that I don't
want to exhaust the user agent.

Are there any rules to follow when deciding to NOT include a specific
part of a representation for a specific media-type? Like: "If the
media-type can honor it you must include it"? Or judgment and best
effort is enough?

"The 'profile' Link Relation Type" is now available as version 02 
(draft-wilde-profile-link-02) at 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link. please send 
feedback to the apps-discuss@... mailing list. thanks. the draft's 
abstract reads:

"This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that allows 
resource representations to indicate that they are following one or more 
profiles.  A profile is defined to not alter the semantics of the 
resource representation itself, but to allow clients to learn about 
additional semantics (constraints, conventions, extensions) that are 
associated with the resource representation, in addition to those 
defined by the media type and possibly other mechanisms."

kind regards,

&gt; I'd change the redaction a bit in section 4.1: "It is an object whose

&gt; *property* names are link relation types". The same thing in 4.2.

thanks, will amend

&gt; Appart for these, I'd remove the "hreflang" link attribute, what if a
&gt; resource supports several languages? The language stuff seems better
&gt; addressed using HTTP headers rather than a link attribute.

This is optional and intended as a 'hint' as this is how its defined
in the Web Linking RFC that's referenced.

I was actually considering introducing all of the remaining link
params introduced by Web Linking - I take it you would be against that
decision?

&gt; I'd remove
&gt; the "self" link since it is redundant. The resource consumer already
&gt; knows the resource URIs.

That may be true for the root resource, but not for the embedded
resources. I think it's 'tidier' to include it for all resource
objects as it is consistent and lends itself better to situations
where resources are included as partials within other documents.

Hi, and thanks for that RFC.

At http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html it is mentionned that 
"Content embedded within a Resource element MAY be a full, partial, 
summary, or incorrect representation of the content available at the 
target URI ..."

When discovering HAL I found this line very useful in understanding the 
power of embedded resources + self link combination. Maybe the RFC 
should re-use this phrase ?

A second thought, but it may be out of line : since
* all sub-resources are embedded via a rel value
* have a self link
* can have a partial content
what goal does the "_links" special attribute serves ? couldn't links be 
considered as "empty embedded resources" ?

For example, the following :

{
   "_links": {
     "self": { "href": "/orders" },
     "next": { "href": "/orders?page=2" },
   },
   "_embedded": {
     "order": { ... }
   }
}

Could as weel be translated into :

{
   "_self": { "href": "/orders" },
   "_embedded": {
     "next": {
         "_self" : { "href": "/orders?page=2" },
     },
     "order": {
         ...
     }
   }
}

It seems to me that replacing "_links": { "self" : {} }  by a simple 
"_self" : {} doesn't impair the possibility to reference the page 2 
under a "next" rel.

Thanks for your precisions
Franï¿½ois

To comment on my own comment, this is even more simple into the XML 
representation :

&lt;resource href="/orders"&gt;
&lt;link rel="next" href="/orders?page=2" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="search" href="/orders?id={order_id}" /&gt;
&lt;resource rel="order" href="/orders/123"&gt;
&lt;link rel="customer" href="/customer/bob" title="Bob Jones 
&lt;bob@...&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;resource rel="basket" href="/orders/123/basket"&gt;
       ...
&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/resource&gt;

Could as well be :

&lt;resource href="/orders"&gt;
&lt;resource rel="next" href="/orders?page=2" /&gt;
&lt;resource rel="search" href="/orders?id={order_id}" /&gt;
&lt;resource rel="order" href="/orders/123"&gt;
&lt;resource rel="customer" href="/customer/bob" title="Bob Jones 
&lt;bob@...&gt;" /&gt;

<pre>Hi Francios,

I actually started out intiially with this design. The problem I found was
that it wasn't very good for readability, and some people just seemed to
find it confusing. So I opted to split them into two different elements.

I think having them as two distinct elements improves the aesthetics of the
type and doesn't add too much in terms of additional complexity.

&gt;

Encoding a hal document into a Data URI and using that  does present a way
of being able to achieve something similar but with obvious drawbacks.

As I said, I did start out with this goal but in practice it is difficult
to incorporate in a way that both useful in practice and doesn't create a
lot of complexity. It's possible that a future media type could further
constrain hal and bridge this gap, but for now it is too costly.

There's a couple of ways of approaching this:

Assuming it is not an entry point into the application, then the
preceding link relation type which led to the resource can infer the
info/state variables. This link relation type should be a URI, and
that URI should expose documentation to that effect (as a web page)
and it could also expose a JSON Schema document.

The other approach is to add a profile link to each of the resources
which points to a URI which works much the same way as the link
relation type above i.e. inferring info/state/semantics.

Does that answer your Q?

Yes it does, which may or may not be suitable for your use case. Of
course, this isn't something the first option suffers from.

Sure that's also possible.

fwiw, I generally try to avoid putting app-specific things like this
in the headers because they "take more effort to get at", and
intermediaries can do nasty things with the headers which will
introduce bugs in your app.

<pre>Erik,

would it be a bad idea to extend text/plain with a profile link to add
basic hypermedia controls? I'm speaking of controls that would be
displayed as plain text, maybe appended at the end of the text
representation as a tiny domain specific language. Nothing would
change to the processing rule of text/plain. But the presence of a
certain link relation would allow a user agent to parse the dsl and
allow a person to activate them. In the context of a command line
interface, that could be practical.

How could a link relation could be add to a text/plain response?

Thanks,

This is actually a fascinating question, IMHO.

You can reformulate a bit and ask: "Given the usual flexibility (optionality of most elements) in well designed media types, how does a server developer know what a correct response body looks like. An Atom &lt;feed/&gt; is a correct response from the POV of the media type spec, but we would consider a blog server to be broken if it responded like this all the time.

Looking a the application the client intends to create (the use case realized by the user agent) is not an option because in a RESTful system the server does not (and must not) know the application the client is trying to walk through.

All the server developer really has is the media type spec of the media type it is going to serve.

So, how does Joe-server developer know what to implement (or what he is allowed to change when altering the implementation of an existing service)?


The solution to the 'problem' is that the server developer's task is not to implement something useless, but to expose the capabilities of the server side component in a way that provides a benefit to the client, in a way that is useful. You could add: in a way that maximizes re-usability.

These things are what lead the server developer during implementation.

Interestingly, this is not different from RPC systems, because a service that always responds to

service.getPendingOrders()

with an empty list surely honors the interface spec, but would still be broken in the same way as the &lt;feed/&gt;-responding server would be.

Hence the short answer is "common sense" :-)

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; would it be correct for an application to provide partial resource
&gt; representation when providing a certain media-type?
&gt;
&gt; My use case is that I have a user agent which don't have any
&gt; formatting capabilities nor metadata capabilities. Would it be correct
&gt; to "reserve" a specific media-type for that type of user agent so my
&gt; application can skip the generation of a bunch of markup and metadata
&gt; as a representation? And sometimes the reason is just that I don't
&gt; want to exhaust the user agent.
&gt;
Sure, why not?

Consider, say, BMP vs PNG, where BMP is basically a raw pixmap and PNG is
compressed. Here, since PNG is lossless, so there's not much of a
compromise in place unless the client simply can't decode PNG (always
possible).

But then consider BMP vs JPEG. JPEG is lossy, but the results are certainly
adequate for a lot of use cases.

Consider a low fidelity "mobile" representation. That seems completely
appropriate, don't you think?


&gt; Are there any rules to follow when deciding to NOT include a specific
&gt; part of a representation for a specific media-type? Like: "If the
&gt; media-type can honor it you must include it"? Or judgment and best

&gt;
The server lets the client know what's available, the client asks for what
it wants -- that's as basic a heuristic as you can get.

Obviously, especially in the case of mobile web, a lot of sites intuit what
it wants to deliver based on the Agent, rather than simply the content type
(since mobile browsers don't really look any different from desktop ones if
you look solely at content type). But that's really a browser limitation
combined with no real alternative data types (text/lite-html or something).

The real issue is that the content-type can not convey all of the desires
of the client. text/html is a perfectly adequate content type for both
mobile and 30" display, multi core, Gb networked workstations. Content type
can not, and should not, convey semantics -- it's simply not rich enough.
So then it need to become some other attribute of the request, for example:
http://example.com/resource?lightweight=true or something.

But using things like the Agent header I think is valid too to help drive
such decisions on the server.

And, of course, this is only for GETing representations -- this has nothing
to do with PUT or POSTing representations. That's a completely different
animal.

that's an interesting idea, and to some extent (just thinking beyond 
only links here) you're proposing some form of markdown (i am using this 
term generically here), right? i am afraid there are many variants of 
that, and i haven't seen any one standardized, but maybe the original 
one does have quite a bit of adoption. if a markdown variant would 
officially declare what its profile URI is, then it would be quite a 
smart way of telling clients that they could do a better job of 
rendering content, if they received text/plain associated with that 
profile URI.

&gt; How could a link relation could be add to a text/plain response?

since text/plain has no standardized way where to put links that could 
be used, the only possible way would be the context, so in case of HTTP 
that would be a Link header. if text/plain were redefined to also allow 
a media type parameter named "profile" (as recommended in 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-3.1), 
then this would be another good place to put it (and one that could be 
used in emails as well, which is not the case for the HTTP Link header).

great idea, are you planning to implement this in some way? cheers,

dret.

<pre>Wrt working with HTTP, I don't think it matters that much what pattern you pick.

As long as you can route URI patterns to handlers, and then have those handlers read the request message, access or modify the server side state, and finally render a response (headers and body) - you should be golden as far as HTTP is concerned.

Well in example in Spring controllers, nothing keeps you from making use 
of configurations or annotations to map URI patterns and HTTP verbs to 
@Controller methods, and likewise you can make these methods work with 
Request/Response the way you possibly would by just using plain 
HttpServlets or something the like. From that point of view, I don't see 
these things to be too bad. But generally indeed it seems these 
frameworks are built around a completely different idea, just 
considering the "view" approach in Spring MVC which, though not limited 
to that, still is pretty much centered around the idea of providing 
"views" in terms of user interaction, thus human-parseable HTML forms.

You can do way more with Spring MVC, but ultimately it boils down to 
this, and this also is how tutorials seem to be crafted. This might be 
good to those who already are knee-deep into HTTP while it might make 
things difficult to others trying to start out right this.

One word on SOAP however, from my point of view: Yes, SOAP folks did 
decide to just using HTTP as a transport protocol, which however, as far 
as I see things, is not a mistake but an actual design decision, and not 
a bad one from my point of view. Maybe there are smart and sane use 
cases for both. :)

The language we use and names we chose while coding is extremely

Representations and uniform interface (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is the
'ubiquitous language' of the Web.
That should be reflected in the code.

I personally tend to think it's a matter of use cases and possibly 
levels of abstraction.

You can start out building a desktop GUI living on an Xlib like level of 
graphics primitives, you can live on an Eclipse or NetBeans RCP level of 
an actual "application platform" which includes user interfaces on a way 
higher level than just rectangles, all along with things like backend 
services, event listeners and the like (and in best(?) cases even 
abstracts things such as data or filesystem access), and you can go 
somewhere in between. What's wrong having similar choices while building 
web applications as long as you know the benefits and limitations of the 
different approaches? ;)

I'm looking to get around the need for such a dsl. For search forms, I
would use OpenSearch by using the Link header field with rel="search"
as standardized by rfc5988. The Link header field is IMO very well
suited for representations which will be consumed by command line
programs because of the way the terminal was meant to be used (the
controls are outside the documents they work on, hence command line
options).

I don't know if I should put efforts in defining new link relations
for what is currently missing in the public domain or simply use a
profile link as in draft-wilde-profile-link-02. If ever form controls
is ever possible to be defined as link relation. Any idea on this?

In all case, a profile link for the markdown rendering looks good.

&gt;

I never cared for the phrase "MVC" to represent Frameworks like Struts and
Spring "MVC". I never felt it was a good fit.

I've always preferred "Action Framework", because I think it better models
the application, even though some "MVC"-eque parts are used in the back end.

This is also to distinguish such frameworks from the Component Frameworks
like JSF, Play, or the original .NET. Those also use MVC at their core, but
on a much more granular level (the component) than the Action Frameworks
(which works more at the action/page/resource level).

Action Frameworks (AF) play "better" with the web and HTTP than the
Component Frameworks (CF). I don't think the AF hide HTTP at all, or when
they do, it's much less than the CF do. With something like JSF or Play,
etc. HTTP is completely buried. As a rule, they tend to POST for everything.

AF assign logic to URLs more directly. In fact, one of their primary goals,
especially early one, was binding URLs to logic, logic that can represent
resources.

Obviously, in the early days, it was all about forms and pages, because
that's the meat and potatoes of web applications, before the "formality" of
resources and REST etc.

The biggest crime of the legacy action framework is they tend to hide the
HTTP method, conflating GET and POST more often than not, and having little
support for the others. This is not a capital crime however, since
pragmatically when dealing with raw web browsers, that's all you can get
anyway. Recall that almost all of this is not so much influenced by HTTP,
but by the browsers that leverage it. Only in the past few years has "pure"
HTTP processing risen, especially with the rise of XHR and ad hoc "RESTful"
*cough* web services.

Adding method support to the AFs that don't support it is really
straightforward.

More modern "rest" frameworks like JAX-RS offer more robust binding and
dispatch options based on URLs than the earlier AFs, simply because of the
demand for even more exposure to HTTP. They also offer better support for
content types other than HTML. But these are evolutionary frameworks, not
revolutionary. The basic concept of mapping URLs to logic is fundamental,
but the modern ones add more features for better access to HTTP methods,
content type management, etc.

JAX-RS works just fine as a conventional Java AF, with requests coming in,
logic being peroformed, and results displayed through forwarded JSP. it's
just not marketed as such, and there are few tutorials demonstrating it
used as such.

The older AFs aren't going anywhere, their methodologies are quite valid
for a wide range of use cases on the modern web, they're well documented,
and there's a huge amount brain share trained in the techniques. Their
advantages far, far outweigh any ideological warts in terms of their
conformity to a specific dogma of what web development "should be".

I've always advocated that "Web Apps" and "REST" are not, nor do they need
to be, the same thing. They fit different domains of application types and
use cases. The modern AFs are simple to use, wafer thin in terms of
abstractions, and quite transparent, with very little black magic. You can
easily understand what should happen by looking at an HTTP request. Yet
offer enough functionality and flexibility to remove a lot of the tedium of
web development today.

&gt; in place unless the client simply can't decode PNG (always possible).
&gt;
&gt; But then consider BMP vs JPEG. JPEG is lossy, but the results are certainly
&gt; adequate for a lot of use cases.
&gt;
&gt; Consider a low fidelity "mobile" representation. That seems completely
&gt; appropriate, don't you think?

Yes that is a good example.

&gt; And, of course, this is only for GETing representations -- this has nothing
&gt; to do with PUT or POSTing representations. That's a completely different
&gt; animal.

If for example PUT would need to be made on such resource, then I
guess the client would need to GET the lossless representation first
on his mobile device before manipulating it with the user agent and
sending the modified version to the server. In your case the use for
the lossy representation may be a preference. But there are case when
user agent limitation could not get around this. So it would have to
PUT the lossy representation on the server.

Erm, no :-) That would be the hypermedia constraint.

Yep - sorry. I keep summing this up under 'media type'. And continue to get beaten up for it :-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The solution to the 'problem' is that the server developer's task is not to implement something useless, but to expose the capabilities of the server side component in a way that provides a benefit to the client, in a way that is useful. You could add: in a way that maximizes re-usability.
&gt; 
&gt; I have face limitations when thinking of re-usability. My first

&gt; 

And a matter of being interested in long-term benefits. Not many people are ... and sometimes rightly so :-)

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

As a long-time XML user, I was slightly shocked when I first read in "REST In Practice" [1] that XML as a hypermedia format is a non-starter.  When I read it a second time, in "Hypermedia APIs in HTML5 and Node.js" [2], I was stirred!  How could it be that such a flexible tool (my hammer!) had not incorporated a concept so fundamental to the web and especially REST??

Upon further reflection, I determined that something must be done!   But what?  XLink had tried, and failed.  Atom had extensively consulted the community resulting in a nicely generic hypermedia format that may yet hit the big time: the open Web.

Why had XML, whose charter states, "Its goal is to ... be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML." [3], failed to achieve that goal?

I have come to think that the problem lies in the very flexibility which gives XML its power; it may also be that flexibility which has prevented it from achieving its number one goal.

To that end, I pondered what (that was easy, mostly copy from html), and how, to "cast in stone" hypermedia affordances in XML.  Why?  So they could be relied upon as hypermedia affordances, across all XML-based media types.  So that potentially, browsers which already supported, for example application/xml, could further recognize those affordances and allow users to leverage the power of REST through media types apart from text/html.

I've speculated about these ideas in the past [4],[5] got some support from some very smart people ;-), and was also referred to the discussion of the classification of hypermedia affordances in Mike Amundsen's book [2].  I've used that classification to refine the scope of a set of XML-based hypermedia affordances which could be shared across all XML media types, especially application/xml, I think in a backwards-compatible way.  I would love to hear your comments, good, bad or indifferent, and questions, about this proposal, especially if you develop browsers or related devices for a living.

I include an XML Schema which I wrote, which contains some comments explaining these core affordance components.   There are now, and hopefully 'forever', seven core attributes: xml:href, xml:tref, xml:src, xml:rel, xml:type, xml:hreflang and xml:method.  The idea behind using attributes is that they can be re-combined as appropriate to the situation, as illustrated by the Amundsen's hypermedia affordance classification.  It seems to me that the only thing preventing their use is, well, nothing, and everything.  In order to be useful, they need acceptance, and probably a place among these other specifications [6],[7],[8].  The latter won't happen unless there is a significant degree of the former [9].

You might ask, why not just @href, etc?  The trouble is, in XML, attributes are in no namespace.  They borrow their context from the element they sit on.  @href means whatever the schema designer says it means, which means it can't be relied upon across media types.  The XML namespace, in contrast is fixed, always present, even when not declared, and very very static (appropriately so).  Once defined, these attributes are "cast in stone", so to speak, which is a good (essential) thing for hypermedia affordances.

Here is the schema.  It is not directly necessary, except to the extent that it documents the "known" combinations of affordances defined. 

So, what do you think?

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"&gt;
    &lt;xs:attribute name="href" type="xs:anyURI"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;Almost self explanatory.  That's a standard at its shared understanding best.  Legal values according to  RFC 3986.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
    &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;xs:attribute name="tref" type="xs:string"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;The tref attribute is a "templated link".  The reason that a separate attribute is required is because the value of an href is expected to be a legal URI, which excludes templated links which follow RFC 6570 because of the use of non-URI characters. In reflecting on templated links, it is likely a good idea to use URI templates in a tref attribute anyway, as this will maximize the possibility of a cacheable response due to the encoding of the order of parameters, as well as their case. In "Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node. Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node", by M Amundsen, ISBN: 9781449309497, p16, an HTML FORM is used to describe the LT H-Factor.   FORMs do not leverage the URI Templates RFC 6570, so it may be possible that URIs composed by application of FORM elements don't follow a predictable parameter order (say this is managed differently by different user agents(?)) hence, may result in less than optimal cacheability of responses. Once processed by a link template processor, value would be a legal URI per RFC 3986.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
    &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;xs:attribute name="src" type="xs:anyURI"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;The src attribute is a URI per RFC 3986, to a resource which is meant to be part of the current resource.  So it combines href with @rel="partof" or something like that.  This has been the subject of much debate since the beginning of time.  In any case, it has a specific composition semantic around the URI it contains.  Since it exists, it might be necessary to also have tsrc attribute to match the tref attribute, but this seems to me to be taking a path similar to what was the subject of the debates above.  So, not going there, just use tref if you need to and once the link is composed, use a @rel associated with the tref to define if it's a composition or not (in your media type definition).&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
    &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;xs:attribute name="rel"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;What is the meaning of a rel value?  I believe the intention is to communicate the relation of the linked-to resource to the current representation. RFC 5988 allows a rel to have &gt; 1 token, whereas atom limits it to 1.  What is the effect/meaning of &gt; 1 value?&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

    &lt;xs:attribute name="type" type="xs:string"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;A media type, per RFC 2046.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
    &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;xs:attribute name="method" type="xs:token"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;An HTTP method, per RFC 2616 section 9.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
                &lt;xs:documentation&gt;The set of LinkAnnotationControls in this media type specification includes only a 'core' group which are needed for RESTful interactions on the Web.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
                &lt;xs:documentation&gt;One of the reasons to *have* a @src attribute is to avoid having to decorate the link because the @src name implies the rel, type and language.  But since they are optional here: if you need them, then use them.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
            &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:attributeGroup&gt;
    &lt;/xs:attributeGroup&gt;

    &lt;xs:attributeGroup name="LinkNonIdempotentAttGroup"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;Examples of Non idempotent hypermedia affordances are certain configurations of the html form element, and the atom publishing protocol collection element, which also acts like a form.  In short, non-idempotent links seem to require more elaborate hypermedia affordances to correctly interact with them.  So recommended practice would be to re-use the hypermedia affordances defined in this specification, and combine them with markup specific to the media type, and document the completed affordance appropriately in the media type documentation.  This is similar to what is recommended in "Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node. Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node", ISBN: 9781449309497, on page 17.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute ref="xml:href"/&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute ref="xml:tref"/&gt;

    &lt;/xs:attributeGroup&gt;
    &lt;xs:attributeGroup name="LinkAnnotationControls"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;According to "Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node. Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node", ISBN: 9781449309497, a CL, or Link Annotation Control, provides inline metadata for the links themselves.  The data allows clients to locate and understand the meaning of links themselves. The best example is that defined by RFC 5023, link@rel="...", where the @rel decorates the uri and indicates to the recipient that the URL has a defined meaning (defined by the media type specification) in the context of the containing response. Curiously, RFC 5988 Web Linking allows a link to contain multiple @rel values, whereas RFC 4287 The Atom Syndication Format allows only a single @rel value.  I believe there was a bit of debate in the atom working group as to whether this should be a "one or more" construct or simply an "only one"; the latter is the final outcome.  This begs the question: what is a @rel value?  What is the effect on the URI? While any given mime type may decide to add other controls beyond @rel, it is the most common example that is useful.  Other examples of the CL factor include XLink's extended set of attributes, which are widely not understood because of their complexity.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute ref="xml:rel"/&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute ref="xml:type"&gt; &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;

    &lt;/xs:attributeGroup&gt;
    &lt;xs:attributeGroup name="MethodControls"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;The last but not least hypermedia affordance is the method attribute, which comes from the most successful hypermedia format on the planet.  So, xml will unashamedly follow the lead of HTML on this attribute.  Use sparingly, otherwise your hypermedia may get so complex as to be unimplementable!&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute ref="xml:method"/&gt;

    &lt;xs:complexType name="ProtocolControls"&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;These hypermedia affordances contain 'hints' eg @type as to what values to use in protocol headers and methods.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

They can not be represented when they both have the same content model, since xml schema thinks they conflict, but obviously a read can`t be a write so if we simply represent both with the LinkAnnotationControl we achieve the same goal, which is to allow authors to mark up their elements to designate them as read or write hypermedia affordances as required.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

Yes, for those header fields that are not defined as control data

That is a perfectly valid thing to do. 'Link' is defined to be an entity header in RFC 5988, section 5 "The Link entity-header field..." and thus can equally well carry hypermedia controls as the message body can.



&gt; What are the downsides of making use of such non first-class

None really. I assume one of the reasons for Link headers being there is exactly that.

&gt; None really. I assume one of the reasons for Link headers being there is exactly that.

There are a few downsides to using Link headers to drive your application:

- There are limits to the size of HTTP header fields that you will run
up against
- You are making people work harder to interact with your application
e.g. there is a relatively low amount of tools available for working
with Link headers
- Expressing links with a Context IRI that is distinct from the
Effective Request URI is cumbersome e.g. representing a set of items
and each of their links is a pain with Link headers.
- iirc, some intermediaries do nasty things to headers that could
introduce bugs in your application

Link headers are good for layering generic protocols on top of HTTP
(e.g. Linked Cache Invalidation) and for adding hypermedia to HTTP
responses with a content-type that has no linking capability, but it's
probably best to avoid using them when they aren't necessary - there
are generic media types for linking available now that you can use to
drive your app without having to resort to the Link headers.

Another issue to think about (although not really a technical
argument) is that if you are designing an application which is
intended to be driven by hypermedia, then stuffing the links up into
headers and 'out of the way' could be sending out the wrong signal to
clients of your application.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

I would like to apologize for my last post - strays way to far into tl;dr territory and I am way too excited, obviously.

What I would like to discuss is this:

Given the fact that XML is *not* a hypermedia format, and also given the fact that being a hypermedia format akin to HTML is its number one goal,

a) Why is it not a hypermedia format?
b) What would the benefits be if XML *was* a hypermedia format and?
c) What ways could that be achieved?

There must be a couple of ways.  XLink seems to have been the first attempt. Atom took another approach (why?), which works well, and seems to have even some traction outside of Atom.  HAL seems to take another approach.

Staying above the fold from here on in :-)
Cheers,
Peter

I've had the same concern. But why in the context of HTTP, hypermedia
have strictly to correspond to the body of the response? What if
everything that is part of the representation including concerned
fields in the header, would compose the hypermedia?

    of information and controls such that the information becomes
    the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains
    choices and selects actions.

Aren't HTTP body and header presented simultaneously? For the sake of
RFC 5988, controls (links) are defined in the header. The body can be
an hypermedia or not, e.g. it can contains controls with informations,
or only informations. Most of the link relations registry defines
controls (from a user-agent viewpoint)  which hold implicit
informations that can be explicitly magnify specifying the title
attribute when using Web Linking.

I can think of some examples of representations being expressed only
with Web Linking, e.g. it would not need a body with additional
informations, or controls. IMO we can have an hypermedia by presenting
controls and informations not necessarily inline, but side by side.
The difference is the way user-agens will display the
controls/informations defined by the Link header field.

I think that presenting controls and informations side by side make a
lot of sense for some user-agents on low formatting capabilities
devices where controls could not be placed inline within the
informations. That configuration does not prevent HATEOAS.

<pre>Hi Roy, nice to see you here,

In the context of HTTP, does the presence of hypermedia controls in the
header of a representation which media-type isn't an hypermedia can still
make HATEOAS possible?

&gt; Yes, for those header fields that are not defined as control data

What about adding a link@rel="edit" (?) or other rel value to the app:collection, to which you could PATCH a feed?  Would we have to update the media type application/atom+xml;type=feed with the extended semantics, but they are backwards compatible so probably not.

<pre>Given that you have a specific media-type(s) for giving extended API errors e.g. application/vnd.andrei.error-v1+json, application/vnd.andrei.error-v2+json
which of the following do you find natural?

#1 Be specific about which error media-type(s) you can accept

#2 If the client lacks specification of an error media-type, assume that it can process the lowest/highest version

Accept: application/vnd.andrei.some-media-type-v1+json
=&gt;
409 CONFLICT

The thing is that for #1 and #3 to take place, basho's webmachine for instance would have to do content-negotiation again, but only for the media-types defined as error media-types and without throwing a 415 MEDIA TYPE NOT SUPPORTED.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] API errors and media-types<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I hadn't thought about using custom media types for errors, but I have run across the Webmachine behavior you mentioned, and believe it to be a bug. Although sending a 415 when the client does not accept the "natural" media type served with another error (409 in your case) is unconditionally compliant with HTTP/1.1, this SHOULD is specifically called out in the spec as one that servers may find useful to relax--and this is a good example.

I'd probably choose to serve a 409 with the error media type most likely to make sense to a human reader in this case, as I'm not sure I would expect a client to be able to recover from the error automatically if it didn't advertise support for one specifically in its Accept header.

Subject:Modeling conditional update based on existence of a dependent resource<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi folks,

I am looking to model an interaction in my REST application where the
client should only be allowed to modify a resource (say "B") if another
resource (say "A") exists.

Using HTTP, if resource A exists, I would like PUT /uri/for/resource/B to
succeed. If resource B does not exist, I would like the same PUT request to
fail, responding with a status code that indicates to the client that
resource A does not exist. So what is a good status code to respond with in
the failure case? I considered 403 Forbidden but its semantics say that
"the request should not be repeated". This does not quite make sense in my
application since resource A might come into existence in the future,
making it okay for the client to re-issue the same PUT request for resource
B.

Alternatively (or additionally?), perhaps the client could issue a
conditional PUT on resource B which would only succeed if resource A
existed. How could I express such a condition in HTTP? I considered using
the If-Match request header but that seems to apply to representations of
the same resource (in my example, B) rather than of other resources (in my
example, A).

Thank you,

Shaunak

You could use a Link header in the error response that has a relation type

But the resource being put to DOES exist, so 404 doesn't make sense.

To me it's more like a validation error, so consider 422 ("unprocesssable

&gt;&gt; Would 404 not suffice here?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But the resource being put to DOES exist, so 404 doesn't make sense.
&gt;

The second sentence starts with "If resource B does not exist", am I
missing something?


&gt;
&gt; To me it's more like a validation error, so consider 422 ("unprocesssable
&gt; entity").
&gt;
&gt;
If 404 really isn't right then 409 Conflict is probably the next best
option in this case.

Ah... in which case you are right.

However, given the question is phrased as an either/or, I suspect the OP
meant to say "if resource A does not exist...", in which case 422 or,
maybe, your 409 might work.

I've asked in the past here about what should be used for validation
errors, and 422 was the advice I got.  You might have been a respondent on
one of those threads yourself, Mike.

It's not atompub, but from an http interface perspective, it doesn't interact with the existing mechanisms and put the "batching" concept at the correct level (the media type).

You could always do PATCH but thats semantics i'm not too keen on personally.

<pre>Sebastien,

Why are you not keen on PATCH semantics?  I thought that the method was part of HTTP, and was meant for requests which
partially update the resource?

Roy has a thing on his blog that says it's ok to use POST.  Is that related to your consideration of PATCH?

http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post

Sorry, I'm green.  And it's not easy!

I've always seen the Hypermedia in HATEOAS, in the context of HTTP as being

<pre>Hi Peter,

FWIK its in-band because they are part of the representation and
standardized in RFC 5988.

RFC 5988 seems to need that we change the way we used to think about
hypertext in HTTP. IMO link relations in the Link header field is
hypertext. RFC 5988 is not a media type specification but define a
generic alternative to respond with hypertext. Content negotiation is
relevant whatever the server would decide upon to use Web Linking
and/or use an entity to enclose in the body, it is only a matter of
syntax preference.

Subject:XML Hypermedia W3C Community Group proposal<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

In recent discussions about xml:href, xml:src, xml:rel, xml:type,  xml:hreflang , xml:method and xml:tref on xml-dev, I've been persuaded that the best/fasted way to turn XML into a hypermedia language is to initiate a W3C Community Group dedicated to this subject, where community opinion can be gathered and represented.

http://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposed/#xmlhypermedia

So far, the idea has received some support, but I feel that there is a lot of latent support out there, and some focused application of hypermedia expertise is all that is required to help XML to become a native hypermedia language.

The bugzilla bug on this topic is here:

https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=17659

I hope that you will consider joining the W3C XML Hypermedia Community Group, in that any changes to W3C standards must be driven by user requirements, and the Community Groups are designed to gather those.   So, if I've misrepresented the requirements, please join and help clarify them.  If you agree with the requirements, please join to show your support.  The more members, the better the chance of change.

Thank you!

Peter

Subject:Bookmark 'stability'<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

one of the obligations a server has in a RESTful system (IMHO
anyway) is to keep those URIs stable that make good bookmarks.
(as in "Cool URIs don't change"). [1]

Some questions keep bugging me:

- Should all URIs a server makes known to clients be considered
  possible bookmarks?
  If not, how do I differentiate between those that are and those
  that are not?

- Given that the applications executed by the clients are not known to
  the server, how can the server possibly know what the steady
  states of all those applications are? And hence, what URIs the
  clients might consider to be bookmarks?

Or is it as simple as

"Bookmarks are resource identifiers from a prior interaction.
They are bread-crumbs. Sometimes they get eaten."  :-)   [2]

[1] And I find it particularly interesting that in this aspect REST is (implicitly) constraining *over time*. Which no other style does, AFAIK.

The more remain constant, the better.

I would say:

1. At a minimum, core discovery URIs (those from which you can find the
rest) should remain constant. If it changes, then the old URI should
redirect to the new (permanent or temporary as appropriate).

2. If the "object" identified by a URI is removed, then 410 is
preferable to 404 as this indicates that the reason the URI is not
returning an entity is that something that was once there was removed,
while a 404 doesn't distinguish this from a bug, a client mistake, or
the service restructuring URI mappings.

3. If a large-scale restructuring is done, or a new domain name used,
etc. then the more old URIs that redirect to the new for as long as
possible, the better.

All that said, I think cool URIs can only be an ideal rather than a
guarantee. Using discovery of URIs through HATEOS can mean that in the
worse case of every single URI changing, a client need have only a
single URI updated to return to being fully operational.

Yes, absolutely! There is no way to prevent clients from remembering
particular URIs so we must assume that all URIs might be bookmarked.
IME, extensive use of bookmarking is required for many -- maybe even
most -- clients that do non-trivial work. In these situations what is
bookmarked will be entirely dependent on the application that client
is running, not on what the server thinks are the "steady states".

Bookmarkability is not a contract, though. A server may respond to
requests of a resource with a 404 or 410 at any time for any reason
but we must accept that doing so may break some clients. Obviously, in
the real world resources are going to disappear. That makes it
incumbent upon clients to handle, as gracefully as possible, the
situation where the bookmarked resource is no longer available.

I agree.  Take web pages and their images: the primary use case is to show
images embedded in web pages in a browser; this is the application. One can
argue that web pages should be bookmarkable as steady states, and that
images (not a typical steady state) need not be bookmarkable.

But the bookmarkability of images is what made Google's image search
possible, and is an example of serendipitous reuse not envisioned by the
original authors of web pages.

InfoQ have now published an introductory article on Restful Objects at
InfoQ [2].  It went up yesterday; there has also been some interesting
follow-up discussion.

Since (I believe) the ideas in the article challenge some commonly held
views; I'd be interested in any reactions from this forum.  In particular,
any discussion on the validity (or otherwise?) of the 2x2 at the end of the
piece would be welcome.

Subject:diff + HTTP PATCH == wrong?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

does anyone sees applying a changeset to a resource as a complete
replacement? I use to think that.

I see devs blindly associating diff-like media with PATCH because of
the largely popular diff/patch utility pair. IMO PUT should be use.
Another reason is that diff resolution is a good candidate for
idempotency.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Diff formats get used with patch because you are required to:

&gt;  The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
&gt;   request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
&gt;   URI.  The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch
&gt;   document" identified by a media type.

&gt; IMO PUT should be use.

PUT requires a full replacement, which makes it not appropriate for a
diff. (unless you have a resource that's a diff, eg,

PUT has replacement semantics, not fullness semantics. This is
obviously the case because you don't have to provide each and every
representation of a resource. Further, the server may modify the
provided representation in any way it sees fit before actually
performing the replacement.

This leaves us with the logical conclusion that PUT requests should
include a complete enough representation to allow the server to
construct all the representations it needs. Complete enough can only
be defined by the server and/or the media type. So PUT has replace
semantics, full stop. If the server can "replace" the existing
representations with representations constructed from the
representation in a particular PUT request it should do so.
(Regardless of what anyone else thinks of the "fullness" of that
representation.)

My point is that a diff entity if it contains an hyperlink to the
original resource via let's say an "original" link relation can stand
for a complete representation.

Everything is there, e.g. the resource is represented by applicable
content to an original representation (not necessarily the eventual
PUT URI, nor the context URI). The  instructions and content (the
diff) media type and the "original" link relation would be registered.
I did not meant the representation to only holds the applicable
content without the "original" link relation. The URI of the
"original" probably would most of the time be the same as the resource
URI (PUT URI).

So now with the link relation to the original resource, I don't see
how a "diff" express as so can still be partial content? Quite compact
yes. Different from the resource yes.

Still disagree?

From httpbis:

Now, the next sentence is interesting, too:

&gt; However, there is no guarantee that

and

Since we are certainly talking about application/domain semantic --
not syntactic -- equivalence, i assert that only the origin server
and/or the media type can define equivalence of representations.
Therefore, *anything* the server wants to do is a-ok as long as it is
a) not actively disallowed by the media type and b) is idempotent from
the application perspective.

I've been asked to set up a generic REST interface for a variety of data,
probably using CherryPy.  We don't appear to have a lot of REST under our

true REST around the internet (getting it conflated with the weaker goals
of RPC), so naturally, I'd like to see if we can get it (REST) right from
the start.  Getting it right seems (so far) to boil down to keeping the
verbs (and adjectives?) out of our URL's, and just letting
GET/PUT/POST/DELETE be our verbs, sent to noun-nodes in our hierarchy.

We're having a discussion about using CherryPy's MethodDispatcher (CRUD)
and RoutesDispatcher (whatever you make of it) - and perhaps others, and
which would be better to encourage true REST.  I caught wind of a meme
suggesting MethodDispatcher is more RESTful (more "directly" REST) than
other dispatchers.  Would it be a bad thing to use one and not the other,
for the sake of REST?  And is REST purity worth bothering with?  Is it a
goal that often can't be reached 100%, but is still worth striving toward?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've never heard that one style of dispatching is more "RESTful" than
another. What most differentiates REST from RPC is the what as known as the
hypermedia constraint. To be fully RESTful (according to the Richardson
Maturity Model[1]), the response generated by the REST interface you are
writing must use a media type that contains "hypermedia controls." With
each interaction with a resource (via the interface you are writing), the
client selects among the hypermedia controls returned in each response to
choose the next interaction it can perform. HTML is only one of many
hypermedia media types containing hypermedia controls.

For a good discussion of hypermedia types (and a list of the popular ones)
see [2]. For a good ranking of the degree of hypermedia-ness
(ie measurement of the level of hypermedia support and sophistication of a
media-type) of various hypermedia types see the hfactor.[3] For a good
example of a JSON-based hypermedia type, see HAL.[4]

Hmm, as far as I can tell, REST's main source of differentiation from RPC is the combination of self descriptive messaging and layered constraint which produces a system in which applications are designed as network-visible interactions as opposed to the non-visible invocations you get from RPC. All of the uniform interface subconstraints separate REST from RPC but I think self descriptive messaging is the key one from that pov

Mike, you may have lost me. How does the requirement of self-descriptive
messaging relate to style of dispatching?

Or are you saying that self-descriptive messaging separates REST from RPC
more than the hypermedia constraint?

If you are saying the latter, then I would claim that there are lots of
self-descriptive RPC architectures out there, so self-descriptive messaging
does NOT separate REST from RPC nearly as much as the hypermedia constraint
does. I'd also argue that the hypermedia constraint is the one that is
hardest for those with a traditional RPC mindset to grok, whereas almost
anyone can grok self-descriptive messaging. So in terms of the mental shift
required, the hypermedia constraint is also the biggest differentiator.

In fact, in his thesis Roy defines REST in terms of the hypermedia
constraint: "This chapter introduces and elaborates the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural style for distributed *hypermedia*systems."
In other words, if you're not doing hypermedia, you're not doing REST.

I was saying the latter.. I'm not saying hypermedia is unimportant, just
that it is not the most fundamental aspect in terms of differentiating from
RPC. As far as I can tell this is reflected in the evaluation section of
Roy's thesis:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_2

"What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are
directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics
that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines
that originate services. The result is an application that allows for
layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the
information origin, which is very useful for an Internet-scale,
multi-organization, anarchically scalable information system. RPC
mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not
network-based applications."

Also, even though it wasn't the point I was making, self-descriptive
messaging can and does effect the style of dispatching. On the web, it's
responsible for enabling the existence of web server component frameworks
such as Ruby's "Rack"[1] or node.js's "Connect"[2].

&gt;

Hmmm...I'm not sure I'm getting your point. Though the section you quote
mentions RPC mechanisms, it doesn't mention either self-descriptive
messaging (SDM) or hypermedia. So how could it possibly reflect anything
about the relative importance of the two in terms of differentiating from
RPC?

What is reflected in the quote is that "generic interfaces with standard
semantics" is the most fundamental aspect in terms of differentiating from
RPC. I would agree that of all the principles the Roy highlights in his
description of REST, the principle of generality/uniformity is the most
important one. Roy's thesis says so quite explicitly: "The *central feature
that distinguishes* the REST architectural style from other
network-based styles [including presumably RPC --nlg] is its emphasis
on a *uniform
interface* between components. By applying the software engineering *principle
of generality* to the component interface, the overall system architecture
is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved." And I've
highlighted the fundamental importance of interface generality/uniformity
in other venues.[1][2]

However, Roy says that four constraints are required for uniform interfaces
(aka generic interfaces): "In order to obtain a *uniform interface*,
multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of
components. REST is defined by *four interface constraints*: identification
of resources; manipulation of resources through representations;
self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application
state." So again, I don't see how the section you quote reflects the
relative importance of *any *of the four interface constraints, much less
the relative importance of just the SDM and hypermedia constraints.

&gt;
&gt; I agree.  Take web pages and their images: the primary use case is to show images embedded in web pages in a browser; this is the application. One can argue that web pages should be bookmarkable as steady states, and that images (not a typical steady state) need not be bookmarkable.
&gt;
&gt; But the bookmarkability of images is what made Google's image search possible, and is an example of serendipitous reuse not envisioned by the original authors of web pages.

Hey, that is a perfect illustration of the point that the server has no idea what the use case of the client is. Thanks!

&gt; IME, extensive use of bookmarking is required for many -- maybe even

Yes, agreed.

&gt; In these situations what is
&gt; bookmarked will be entirely dependent on the application that client
&gt; is running, not on what the server thinks are the "steady states".
&gt; 
&gt; Bookmarkability is not a contract, though. A server may respond to
&gt; requests of a resource with a 404 or 410 at any time for any reason
&gt; but we must accept that doing so may break some clients. Obviously, in
&gt; the real world resources are going to disappear.

Yeah - to hell with referential integrity :-) The key idea behind the
Web's success.

&gt; That makes it
&gt; incumbent upon clients to handle, as gracefully as possible, the
&gt; situation where the bookmarked resource is no longer available.

Yep. +1

<pre>There's something I'm not getting about REST.

We're supposed to use HTTP verbs like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

But we're also supposed to be avoiding server state, like sessions.

How can we have a stateless protocol (that is, a protocol in which all
state is saved in the client, using the REST hierarchy as a sort of state
machine), that supports a DELETE operation?

Are some HTTP verbs more RESTful than others?  It seems like PUT, POST and
DELETE are all about storing state on the server.

Resource state is not the same as application state. The former is generally under the control of servers and the latter should be maintained by the client using standardized methods (which exchange representations) on uniform identifiers to advance from one application state to another. See http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-hypermedia, for example, for a more in-depth discussion.

Right. REST does not allow *session* state. All information about the state of the current application (the interacion that is going on between client and server)
must reside on the client. 

&gt; 
&gt; How can we have a stateless protocol (that is, a protocol in which all state is saved in the client, using the REST hierarchy as a sort of state machine), that supports a DELETE operation?

Of course you can have server side state. That is except for a few edge cases of purely-processor-like-resources (e.g. convert Word to PDF service) the whole point: to access and alter server side state. Just never store interaction state there - if you want to then make it a resource. A shopping cart[1] that is implemented as a resource would be such an example.

[1] Though the canonical shopping cart in REST would be a state bucket on the client that is filled during interactions and only submitted to the server at checkout, when the order is placed.

Odd interpretation of what?

My thinking is based on [1] but surely a server side resource-cart is fine as well. Especially if you want to maintain it across browsers.

Mike, I'm generally with you on this... basically some sort of optimistic
locking approach ought to be sufficient.

Absolutely, key is that this is a design consideration rather than a

in theory, that's true. in practice, most people see no problem saying 
their cart is /cart/42 and that orders go to /cart/42/order and have no 
indication in the request that the order is about /cart/42. then when 
they want to switch to a different ordering mechanism, they break

/cart/42/order and /cart/42/. my general strategy therefore is to

I don't think it's correct to characterise self-descriptiveness in
boolean terms. There's a whole continuum of self-descriptiveness, and
some parts of an interaction do not necessarily need visibility. For
example, if my API requires clients to include headers for their
star-sign, what their favourite episode of Friends is, and rating of
their current happiness levels out of 10.. it's "more
self-descriptive" than your API but not in a useful way, as the
primary purpose of self-descriptive messaging is to enable
intermediate processing. I don't think my example reduces the
intermediate processability of the interaction in a significant way,
so I don't think it's a lot less self-descriptive, and it's definitely
self-descriptive in a useful sense: an invalidating request has been
made altering the state of the /cart/123 resource.

M

That's not self-descriptive, it's just "descriptive".

Self-descriptive is where the message's meaning depends only on the
message itself (as interpreted by referenced standards).

What part of the dissertation are you claiming this request would be entirely non self-descriptive?

If youre being pedantic because I omitted Content-Type: application/xml then please lets just pretend that was included in the example.. Still not self-descriptive?

It is self-descriptive to an extent: it's a non-safe request to the cart resource to process the message in some way, it's a cache-invalidating request. Interestingly, the last bit of self-description is not actually present in Mark's example.

If you want to argue for superior self-descriptiveness, you need to explain why the additional visibility you are creating will enable otherwise-impossible intermediary mechanisms. Otherwise you should be arguing some other system property than self-descriptiveness.

It seems to me like there is not a clear enough definition of "self-descriptive" and/or visibility. And this results in it being used as a go-to argument for anyone that prefers a long winded, verbose design approach. Which is a shame.

Subject:Logic behind Amazon Web Services APIs?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi! I've been following this list for quite some time, this is my first post.

I was looking at the AWS documentation and noticed that they have HTTP APIs (sometimes refering to them as REST APIs and all that).

Now, the weird part is that it's not even method tunneling through POST payload and/or URI queries, but

a) They're using GET for everything [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/APIUsage.html]
(I found a thread regarding this - "SimpleDB: welcome to 1999" [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/9994] It's from 2007. So, I guess nothing's changed.)

AND
b) Method tunneling through a custom HTTP header [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/MakingHTTPRequests.html]
e.g:

POST / HTTP/1.1
host: dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date: Mon, 16 Jan 2012 17:49:52 GMT
x-amz-target: DynamoDB_20111205.CreateTable



Is there a reason for this design?
What are the benefits?

Maybe AWS are routing requests according to header value before the whole message is received so that you don't have to parse the message to get the operation method (as when using XML-RPC). Is that even a 'thing'?

But why use HTTP if you're gonna misuse it? 

What do you think?
You know, am I missing something?

 


Thanks!

Dimitar A.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Sometime last year, I became really interested in what REST and the ideas
of Hypermedia actually are. Since then, I've done a lot of
reading/searching/fumbling/etc.

First, I'd like to thank those that have taken time to explain ideas in
mailing lists/books/etc.

Second, I'd like to ask those wiling to let me know how well my
understanding is. I fully believe that the best way to prove if someone
understands something is to have them explain it to you. I decided to try
this out by answering a question on StackOverflow that I felt was something
I probably would have asked back when I was first starting out.

I know it's pretty long, but if anyone would like to take the time to check
out the question (
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9727394/whats-the-best-most-restful-way-to-simulate-a-procedure-call-over-http)
and my resulting answer (

and let me know of anything you would disagree with to help me in my
understanding.

&gt; 

You're talking about self-descriptiveness and visibility and giving an
example which fails to state a media type, or assumes application/xml.
Do you not see where this might be confusing to folks trying to learn
REST?  While there are no "degrees" it's fundamental that a media type
be declared, registered, and suitable for a hypertext-driven API.

&gt;
&gt; It is self-descriptive to an extent: it's a non-safe request to the
&gt; cart resource to process the message in some way, it's a
&gt; cache-invalidating request.
&gt; 

Self-descriptive fundamentally means that you've declared a media type
such that intermediaries can determine how to decipher the payload.
You can't just hand-wave your way around this requirement by stating
that it somehow isn't required for self-descriptiveness, that other
factors are enough.

&gt;
&gt; If you want to argue for superior self-descriptiveness, you need to
&gt; explain why the additional visibility you are creating will enable
&gt; otherwise-impossible intermediary mechanisms. Otherwise you should be
&gt; arguing some other system property than self-descriptiveness.
&gt; 

I don't know what "superior" means, I'm making an argument for the
basics here, and I have no idea what "other" system property this would
fall under.  I'm not creating "additional" visibility here, just
stating the basic requirement for visibility.  If an intermediary can't
determine how to process the payload, then anything else it can deduce
about the message (cache-invalidating, non-safe, etc.) is useful, how?

&gt;
&gt; It seems to me like there is not a clear enough definition of
&gt; "self-descriptive" and/or visibility. And this results in it being
&gt; used as a go-to argument for anyone that prefers a long winded,

&gt; 

There is, but apparently you don't much care for it, instead making
semantic arguments about what else self-descriptive might mean, which
seems to be your go-to argument for cutting corners on REST's
constraints.  The rest of us have long since achieved consensus on the
meanings of Roy's terminology.

http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/specialization

You can't just redefine "visibility" to mean what you want it to mean,
as I've repeatedly tried telling you.  Your response is always
personal, i.e. my "shameful long-winded verbose design approach" and
your previous comments about how *you* prefer systems that actually
work. Well, I like systems that work, too, which is not mutually
exclusive of implementing REST's constraints as you continually infer
in your posts.

Either a message is self-descriptive, allowing for intermediary
processing, or it isn't.  There are no "degrees" here, however much you
may want there to be to legitimize your redefinition of terms like self-
descriptive, or visible.

&gt;
&gt; There's a whole continuum of self-descriptiveness, and
&gt; some parts of an interaction do not necessarily need visibility. For
&gt; example, if my API requires clients to include headers for their
&gt; star-sign...
&gt;

All parts of a RESTful system require self-descriptive messaging, it's
a constraint.  Any application-specific headers that intermediaries
have no need to consider to determine how to process a message, have no
bearing on self-descriptiveness.  They may make your system self-
describing, which I think you get confused with self-descriptive, but
they certainly don't make it "more self-descriptive" by any stretch.

&gt;&gt; star-sign...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All parts of a RESTful system require self-descriptive messaging, it's
&gt; a constraint.  Any application-specific headers that intermediaries
&gt; have no need to consider to determine how to process a message, have no
&gt; bearing on self-descriptiveness.

How are you determining whether or not a given header needs to be considered by an intermediary? What if I need a proxy distributing requests through my system dependant on the client's star sign?

I think it might help if you share some extracts from the dissertation that back up the point you are trying to make.

Cheers,
M

&gt;
&gt; There are no "degrees" of self-descriptive.

Restating your own opinion is not a real answer to that question.
Sharing extracts or linking to a specific section would help.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If youre being pedantic because I omitted Content-Type:
&gt;&gt; application/xml then please lets just pretend that was included in
&gt;&gt; the example.. Still not self-descriptive?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You're talking about self-descriptiveness and visibility and giving an
&gt; example which fails to state a media type, or assumes application/xml.
&gt; Do you not see where this might be confusing to folks trying to learn
&gt; REST?

I didn't leave it out on purpose. I corrected myself. It is not that
big of a deal.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is self-descriptive to an extent: it's a non-safe request to the
&gt;&gt; cart resource to process the message in some way, it's a
&gt;&gt; cache-invalidating request.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Self-descriptive fundamentally means that you've declared a media type
&gt; such that intermediaries can determine how to decipher the payload.

Yes, I forgot to include a Content-Type header, we've established that now.

The payload (request body) is one part of an HTTP request message,
there's also all the headers. GET requests don't have a payload or a
Content-Type and they're self-descriptive.

&gt; You can't just hand-wave your way around this requirement by stating
&gt; that it somehow isn't required for self-descriptiveness, that other
&gt; factors are enough.

Yes, I forgot to include a Content-Type header, we've established that now.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you want to argue for superior self-descriptiveness, you need to
&gt;&gt; explain why the additional visibility you are creating will enable
&gt;&gt; otherwise-impossible intermediary mechanisms. Otherwise you should be
&gt;&gt; arguing some other system property than self-descriptiveness.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't know what "superior" means, I'm making an argument for the
&gt; basics here, and I have no idea what "other" system property this would
&gt; fall under.  I'm not creating "additional" visibility here, just
&gt; stating the basic requirement for visibility.  If an intermediary can't
&gt; determine how to process the payload, then anything else it can deduce
&gt; about the message (cache-invalidating, non-safe, etc.) is useful, how?

well, for example, a cache that knows the request is
cache-invalidating and if it receives a success response from the
origin server the cache knows that it should purge on that URI.

Or a a security proxy that throttles write requests for clients can
increment its count for that client.

Or the request could include an If-Match header so that a cache knows
it's stale and respond with a 412 without having to hit the origin
server.

None of those intermediary mechanisms require the payload to be
processed, in fact processing the payload for those purposes would be
entirely redundant and incredibly inefficient.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It seems to me like there is not a clear enough definition of
&gt;&gt; "self-descriptive" and/or visibility. And this results in it being
&gt;&gt; used as a go-to argument for anyone that prefers a long winded,
&gt;&gt; verbose design approach. Which is a shame.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is, but apparently you don't much care for it, instead making
&gt; semantic arguments about what else self-descriptive might mean, which
&gt; seems to be your go-to argument for cutting corners on REST's
&gt; constraints.  The rest of us have long since achieved consensus on the
&gt; meanings of Roy's terminology.
&gt;
&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/specialization

That post is irrelevant. Please just share relevant quotes/links which
actually clarify the terminology in question.

Subject:SOA with REST title now available worldwide<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Gentlefolk,

I haven't posted here for a while, but many of you know me as having been
active to varying degrees in the REST community for about 6 years now. I
have some significant experience implementing REST in machine to machine
environments (browser free environments) in backend business systems,
realtime safety-related control systems, and a number of other esoteric
environments that involve leading people and negotiating internal and
business to business interfaces with people with varying levels of REST
expertise and enthusiasm. Over the last few years I have been working with
a number of others on the title mentioned in the subject line.

It's a title I don't expect to pass by this list without criticism. It uses
vocabulary that is often more on the SOA side than on the REST side. It
focuses on REST "service contracts" (the set of urls exposed by a server
and the server-specific meaning of standard methods and media types in
those resources) as a standard tool for governing "REST services" as part
of an overall service inventory. It focuses almost entirely on machine to
machine interaction within the context of IT assets of a single enterprise.
It doesn't deal much with browsers or mashups and it even spends a
significant amount of time addressing issues like transactions and pub/sub.
Perhaps for some the very fact that Thomas Erl's name is on the cover well
push some buttons :)

Nevertheless we collectively and I in particular have worked hard not to
compromise on REST principles and constraints while still making the
content accessible to SOA people and the general population. Within this
context of heavy machine to machine interaction we deal with defining a
uniform interface to cover an inventory of services within a particular
enterprise, and how that should relate to service contracts and to broader
standardisation efforts. We look to move past SOA's traditional limit of
increasing intrinsic interoperability only within a given inventory and
instead look for standard methods and media types to increase
interoperability to more massive scales.

We have sought to keep hypermedia core to the practice of building
inventories of services and their related customers and to minimise
coupling while also being explicit about why we do this. We have sought to
drive a hard line on the stateless constraint and what that means to the
aforementioned patterns of transactions (promoting compensating over
atomic) and pub/sub (promoting cached polling and delta encoding).

Some of you have already seen the material in various stages of completion
as have many SOA guys. Over the last six months or so the manuscript
changed significantly as we worked that feedback into the finished product.

No book is perfect, but I hope this one will end up bringing the REST and
SOA worlds together in a closer understanding without compromising one iota
of what is important to each. I'm confident that despite the unfamiliar
wording, context and audience that the book is written to be applied to
that at its heart is a true application of REST constraints and to every
possible extent a true application of the years of experience the REST
community has developed.

<pre>In my company, we figured that SOA principles were suited for our needs at

as a usefull adding to our design needs. As far as I'm concerned, both make
a quite complete architecture guideline.

&gt; That's not self-descriptive, it's just "descriptive".
&gt;
&gt; Self-descriptive is where the message's meaning depends only on the
&gt; message itself (as interpreted by referenced standards).
&gt;
&gt;
This is one of the issues that I still fail to grasp.

Consider that I want to order a item from a store that has their own custom
media type for placing the order.

POST /order
Content-Type: application/vnd.aonlinestore.orderform

&lt;order&gt;
   &lt;partno&gt;1234232323&lt;/partno&gt;
   &lt;qty&gt;1&lt;/qty&gt;
   &lt;price&gt;51.99&lt;/price&gt;
&lt;/order&gt;

I am assuming that this message is considered sufficiently self-descriptive
based on the semantics defined in the custom media type spec .  Although, I
do have to trust that the store does not redefine what that part number is
used to represent between the time I create the cart and the time I place
the order.

So what happens if the store decides in it's wisdom to use URIs to identify
products, and so the message would be,

POST /order
Content-Type: application/vnd.aonlinestore.orderform

&lt;order&gt;
   &lt;partno&gt;http://aonlinestore.com/products/1234232323&lt;/partno&gt;
   &lt;qty&gt;1&lt;/qty&gt;
   &lt;price&gt;51.99&lt;/price&gt;
&lt;/order&gt;

Now the partno is a link to another resource that describes the product.
 Are we still self-descriptive?

What if the store decided that using SKUs (stock keeping units) was a
better option and so now a quantity isn't necessary.

POST /order
Content-Type: application/vnd.aonlinestore.orderform

&lt;order&gt;
   &lt;sku&gt;http://aonlinestore.com/sku/1234232323Q1&lt;/sku&gt;
   &lt;price&gt;51.99&lt;/price&gt;
&lt;/order&gt;

Now my order is even more dependent on an external resource to identify
what I am buying.

At which point, I don't see the difference between this last message and
going a step further and creating a resource out of my desire to purchase
something, and then using that in my message.

POST /order
Content-Type: text/uri-list

http://aonlinestore.com/user/234/requisition/3453/line/1


As a user, I am expressing the intent "please order the thing I told you
that I wanted to order".  If, as you mention on your blog post, the price
has changed since the requisition was made, the user can still be informed.

I don't understand how it is that we lose self-descriptiveness by using a
link to a resource in our message.  Or have I mis-understood the guidance?

Presumably. The two strings are identifiers for the same resource, so
the meaning of those messages appears to be the same.

&gt; &lt;/order&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now my order is even more dependent on an external resource to identify what
&gt; I am buying.

That depends how the media type is defined. If it prescribes that the
use of a SKU fixes the quantity by the use of the URI, and that
quantity is invariant over time, then the message would have the same
meaning as the others ... at least at the point in time when you make
that determination. Self-description requires that be true for all
time though (so it always reflects the original intent of the user),
so you'd better have an ironclad guarantee that the vendor won't
change that out from under you. That's the value standardization
brings to self-description.

At least, that's how I see it. I'm hardly the authority on this stuff,
but I think I've given it a lot more thought than the average
developer.

Mark.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] REST and DELETE?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hey Mark,

Thanks for the response.  The first two examples were really kind of a lead
in to the third which you didn't comment on.  Based on your explanation, it
would seem that as long as the user is confident that the server isn't
going to mess with their stored cart, then there is no reason why the user
cannot request that the contents of their stored cart be ordered.

The reality is that there needs to be a certain level of trust by the user
in the service they are using.  Whether, the user-agent downloads the cart
and re-posts it to an order processor, or the user-agent posts a link to
stored cart, the intent of the user is the same and a user-agent can quite
easily allow the user to preview the stored cart before posting the link to
be ordered.  I fail to see how a message that refers to a resource loses
its self-descriptiveness.

Regarding the need for the resource to be invariant is also a concern for
me.  Consider the following processing endpoint that stores images of
weather maps of cities.  If you post a text/url-list to it then it
dereferences those urls and stores the resulting image.

POST /WeatherSnapshots
content-type: text/url-list
http://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather

I don't see the benefit of forcing all the extra data transfer required to
do the following,

GET http://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather
=&gt;
200
Content-type: image/jpeg
[bytes]

POST /WeatherSnapshots
content-type: image/jpeg
[bytes]

Imagine the scenario where several times a day a user wanted to take
snapshots of many cities at the same time.  It would be far more efficient
for the client to request that the server perform those requests on it's
behalf than have the client download each than then post them back to the
server.

Think about it this way:

POSTing an explicit cart much more meets that goal that POSTing a URI does.

IOW, the semantics of the message (the deducable intended effect) must, under no cicumstances, be dependent on the nature of the recipient.

Makes sense?

I am not at all convinced that the "self-describing" sub-constraint called
out by Fielding has anything at all to do w/ state (app, client, or
server). Instead, I assert that the "self-describing messages" (SDM)
constraint is applied at the protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XMPP, etc.) level.

IOW, SDMs exist w/o any "knowledge" of the problem-domain being expressed
by that message and SDMs have no role in assuring any problem-domain level

have SDMs in a stateful arch model and you can have stateless arch model
where there are no self-describing messages.

Subject:[rest-discuss] Self-descriptive messages<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Mark,

The interesting thing about the SKU scenario is that the URI may
actually capture the users intent more accurately than explicitly
stating the quantity.  If the request body contains a URI that points
to http://aonlinestore.com/sku/jumbopackofshrimp then that maybe is
the exactly what that the user is requesting.  The fact that this week
a jumbo pack of shrimp contains 10 shrimp and last week it contained 8
shrimp is irrelevant to the user because the identifier is specifying
what the user wants.

I believe that to discount the my weathersnapshot scenario based on
the fact that I used a text/uri-list is addressing a different point.
I admit that I tend to be somewhat more cavalier about allowing the
server to pile on semantics to a message than I would ever allow a
client to do and I realize that't not a good idea.  However, I believe
the point I was trying to make is just as valid if I were to use
application/vnd.acme.list-of-uris-to-weather-images.

What are negative effects of allowing a server to dereference a link
contained in the request to acquire all the information necessary to
process the request?

Clients do this all the time.  A web browser isn't finished processing
a HTML message until it has dereferenced the stylesheet link to get
all the details about how to render the page prettily.  A web page
that is missing all of its images may completely fail to communicate
its intent to the user .

I appreciate the fact that you are trying to address the impact of

I am really struggling to grasp this concept.  You seem to be saying

impossible unless resource state was read-only.

I must be mis-intepreting you.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Self-descriptive messages<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Here's the definition of self-descriptive from Roy Fielding's thesis:

"REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange information, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability."

Now let's look at Darrel's example of POSTing a single URI to the "order this" resource.

1. Interaction is stateless between requests. Check; the client need never have talked to the ordering resource before.
2. Standard methods and media types are used. Check (POST) and check (text/uri-list).
3. Responses explicitly indicate cacheability. Since this exchange is carried over HTTP, the response has well-defined cacheability according to its headers.

So I think this request is completely self-descriptive according to the definition. "Semantics are indicated" through the use of POST, and the "information exchanged" is a single URI, which is a perfectly fine piece of data.

&gt; resource makes the message any more robust in capturing the users

The state of the resource can change between T1 when the client looks at the representation and T2 when the POST is received. How would you ever detect a mismatch?

When you, e.g. place an order, you send an order document with the details you intend the business transaction to be like (items + price). You'd rather not simply refer to some recipient-owned conversational state.

Thinking about it, I guess the real explanation is that the server-side state we are talking about e.g. the cart, is state the client has built up while proceeding through the application (Roy called this workspace state a while ago). In the discussed scenarios we are talking about workspace state that is persistet on the server. Doing so is RESTful (because the state has a URI instead of being session state) but since it is workspace state you should obtain its current representation first and include that in your POST instead of referring to it.

Does that help?

Another thing to consider is that HTTP (not REST[1]) is restricted to a single request target URI[2]. Referring to the, e.g. cart URI, smells like two request target URIs to me: tell the server to GET the cart and apply it's state to the POST execution.

[1] In fact, IIRC Roy has multiple request target URIs on his wish list for WAKA
[2] This is the reason, you cannot implement a RESTful COPY with HTTP

I argued that including the URL to a saved offer-to-buy in a message to convert it into an order was adequately self-descriptive.

At the end of the discussion, I accepted Mark's position, and abandoned my own.  

However, I thought of another reason that convinced me even more of the correctness of Mark's argument from a business standpoint, and that is non-repudiation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation

That is, if both parties to an electronic agreement send, receive and sign each of the full messages exchanged in the dialog, maybe even exchanging the whole built-up sequence each time, they have a record of the agreement that would be difficult for either party to repudiate.

This reason may not have been Roy's reason for including self-descriptive messages as a REST constraint, but it would be important in business contract situations.

There's a very specific definition of self-descriptive (from a REST point-of-view) in Roy's thesis that this request passes. There are a whole bunch of other constraints that aren't part of REST that are needed for an e-commerce system that it almost certainly doesn't, including non-repudiation, transparency of intent, etc.

I'm *not* arguing you should build shopping carts this way; I'm just arguing it fits the very specific, technical definition of self-descriptive. REST isn't a magic wand--meeting its constraints doesn't guarantee you've built a suitable system.

No, I am not going to "settle" the philosophical question with an

My guess is that coupling would be more of a hazard than loss of
visibility, but maybe even that wouldn't matter if the application is

FWIW, the cart/order scenario discussed is just a special case of the more
general idea of 'action resources' (body-less POST to an action-triggering
URI), e.g.

POST /cart?order
Content-Length: 0

Does your argumentation apply equally to the question of whether such
'action resources' are suitable design?

Or is there a fundamental difference between the cart URI being part of
the body and the URI being the 'prefix' of the order-processor-resource?

After all, both could be discovered from hypermedia equally well.

Until now, I have used the self-descriptiveness constraint to argue against
both designs.

Since what you said makes sense to me, I am now in search for a new line of
argumentation against POST /foo?triggerSomeStuffWithFoo

A starting point for me would be that one design only uses a single ordering
resource (/order-processor) while the other yields an unlimited number
(/cart/{id};order)


Can you give a hint?

&gt; The interesting thing about the SKU scenario is that the URI may

&gt; stating the quantity.  If the request body contains a URI that points
&gt; to http://aonlinestore.com/sku/jumbopackofshrimp then that maybe is
&gt; the exactly what that the user is requesting.  The fact that this week
&gt; a jumbo pack of shrimp contains 10 shrimp and last week it contained 8
&gt; shrimp is irrelevant to the user because the identifier is specifying
&gt; what the user wants.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that to discount the my weathersnapshot scenario based on
&gt; the fact that I used a text/uri-list is addressing a different point.
&gt; I admit that I tend to be somewhat more cavalier about allowing the
&gt; server to pile on semantics to a message than I would ever allow a
&gt; client to do and I realize that't not a good idea.  However, I believe
&gt; the point I was trying to make is just as valid if I were to use
&gt; application/vnd.acme.list-of-uris-to-weather-images.
&gt;
&gt; What are negative effects of allowing a server to dereference a link
&gt; contained in the request to acquire all the information necessary to
&gt; process the request?

It's been a while, I'll take a stab... assuming it's truly a URL and
not a URI...

Performance - the server now has to do the de-referencing of a one or more URLs.

Complexity - the order example requires a transaction and
de-referencing adds to the list of things that can go wrong.

Understandability - from a client perspective, it's less
understandable - guarantees that key attributes (e.g. price) of the
target resource hasn't changed and the like.  maybe that could be
covered by some 'purchasing protocol' or somesuch?

Reliability - if the URL needs to be de-referenced and that server is
unresponsive, your whole system is down.

Visibility - moot, because of POST.

Some are admittedly a stretch:)  What are the advantages?

Thanks,

I need to start including facet counts in my ATOM search results. I'd

facet counts included in the results:

href="/search?q=35mm&amp;fq..." /&gt;
     ...

     &lt;entry&gt;
       ...

I'm thinking to overload the "link" elements "length" attribute to hold
the facet count. Is this abuse of the spec or the spirit of REST?

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7.6

In that media type, @length means something different than what I think you are using it for, in which case application/atom+xml no longer applies.

That's the way I see it anyway.

&gt; 

You're not wrong, but I think there's a better way to look at it -- by
staying true to the generic media type, rather than forking it to be a
custom media type for one point of data.  This can be done by extending
Atom (which doesn't change the media type, i.e. it's still application/

Given that Atom is XML and it and its extensions relies mostly on namespaces, I would consider using a custom attribute better way. Something like this:

    &lt;atom xmlns:foo="..."&gt;

    &lt;link rel="related" title="Canon" type="application/atom+xml"
          foo:length="134"/&gt;

I definitely agree with this. Atom is made to be extensible.

<pre>Hi Eric,

I agree a custom attribute is a better way.  And yes, Atom is made to be extensible, so that fits nicely.

All that said, there is nothing about application/atom+xml which implies this extension.  To be self-descriptive, to pick up on the theme from another thread, the client has to request these semantics somehow, and the server has to communicate the fact that they are being provided.  The RESTful way to do this is not through sniffing, but media types.

If the client does request application/atom+xml and receives the extension, no harm is done because of atom's must ignore model.

If the client does request the extension via a custom media type, it expects to be able to process the response based on the Content-Type value returned.

&gt;  I need to start including facet counts in my ATOM search results. I'd
&gt; prefer to reuse existing ATOM elements and attributes if possible.
&gt;

As others have said, there are no built-in atom constructs for the things
you seek other than e.g. putting the facet counts in parenthesis in the
title attribute; your users will quickly understand that "35mm Canon (134)"
means that there are 134 hits for 35mm Canon.

&lt;link rel="related" title="35mm Canon (134)"  ...  /&gt;

When it comes to machine consumption, this won't cut it.  There are,
however a range of extensions to atom that fit what you want to do.

To identify the number of items in a link, there's the "threading"
extension [1] which defines the "thr:count" attribute.  It defines the
number of items behind a link.  The threading extension does talk about
atom collections of comments, and the RFC does limit the specification of
the thr:count to be used on link relations of type "replies"... But IMHO
the extension is more widely applicable to count "the number of items in a
feed behind a &lt;link&gt;."

&lt;link rel="related" title="Canon (134)" thr:count="134" ...  /&gt;

This might not float your boat, so the second thing I would like to point
you to is OpenSearch [2], a wonderful media type and XML language, suitable
for embedding in atom feeds, especially search results.

The full use case for OpenSearch is to inform clients that "here's a search
engine!" and to educate the client on *how* to use it, e.g. to have
browsers discover and use search engines with no user intervention.  The
browser discovers an OpenSearch description document in the web pages, and
then provide search facilities for that server in their search bars.  This
in itself is extremely useful in M2M scenarios where a link relation
"search" which provides an OpenSearch description document allows machines
to perform searches.  Powerful stuff.

OpenSearch provides a number of useful elements to be able to drill down
into responses too, indeed, supporting faceting too, e.g. the Query element
[3].

   &lt;opensearch:Query role="subset"
        searchTerms="35mm Manufacturer:Canon"
        totalResults="134"
        title="Canon" /&gt;

This would be enough to tell an OpenSearch aware atom processing client
that if the searchTerms is set to "35mm Manufacturer:Canon" that a subset
will be made available with 134 items, and to use the label "Canon" when
showing this to a user.

The Query object is usually present in an atom feed when there is a link to
an OpenSearch description document, and usually the same description
document that was used to make the query.  I believe that the Query
(together with the description document) constitutes a link, even though
there is no explicit href anywhere.  The &lt;Uri&gt; element of the description
document contains a primitive form of an URI template, and the attributes
of the Query element are used to fill out the values of the URI template.

So, given an OpenSearch description document with the following template:

&lt;Url type="application/atom+xml"
     template="/search?q={searchTerms}" /&gt;

... and the following element in the atom feed available at /search?q=35mm
(of course with a link back to the OpenSearch description document):

&lt;opensearch:Query role="subset"
      searchTerms="35mm Manufacturer:Canon"
      totalResults="134"
      title="Canon" /&gt;

... then the client will be able to construct the URI
"/search?q=35mm%20Manufacturer%3ACanon", in the expectation of finding a
subset of items from the original query, somehow connected to the text
"Canon" (the title).

What we're missing is of course for OpenSearch to go through the hoops of
being an IETF standard and an IANA registered media type. DeWitt Clinton?

It's not interesting to ask if it is more or less RESTful to do things
using OpenSearch.  I feel it's a way of decoupling the server and the
client; the server may or may not include &lt;Query&gt; elements, and the clients
may or may not understand them if they do, and don't break if they're not
there.  It caters for evolvability in both, and that's a big benefit.

As you might understand, I believe OpenSearch to be quite underrated :-)

On a related note, a friend and colleague (Erlend Hamnaberg) invited me to
help him work on an OpenSearch extension to be able to express more
advanced filtering capabilities [4] in OpenSearch responses atom feeds.
 It's in a very early draft stage :-)

There are many other draft OpenSearch extensions too, e.g. for querying
based on date/time values [5], or by geospatial values [6].

Rich did ask about REST.  You've given him suggestions about extending atom to include Opensearch markup, without mentioning how this impacts the RESTful-ness of the interactions.

If one extends or overloads atom content with Opensearch or elements in a custom or no namespace, you are still changing the semantics of the content.  To maintain the self-describing messages constraint, you need to do something about the media type, otherwise that content remains opaque, or out-of-band.

i'd suggest to use profiles 
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02) to signal that 
overloading of the media type, and ideally a new version of OpenSearch 
would make that explicit by adding a profile URI for OpenSearch.

OpenSearch is nice and a good starting point, but unfortunately it is 
kind of in limbo (everything is undated, some parts are in draft 
status), and the extension model to add some stuff yourself is 
underspecified. and then it's outdated in various ways, for example it 
defines its own URI template format, which by now you really would want 
to substitute with the standardized form.

so while there is useful stuff in OpenSearch and it's implemented in 
various places, it's poorly maintained and i still hope that a9 or 
amazon will fix that at some point in time. we are also considering 
using it, in spite of these issues, but for those looking at it, it's 
important to know that there are some concerns about the spec.

Yeah, I expected some reactions to that statement.  I do see the (slightly)
reduced visibility (pun not intended) of the extensions not being present
in the media type, but I'm not sure that this in any way makes the system
as a whole lose out on anything, or be "more" or "less" RESTful.

&gt;
&gt; If one extends or overloads atom content with Opensearch or elements in a
custom or no namespace, you are still changing the semantics of the
content. To maintain the self-describing messages constraint, you need to
do something about the media type, otherwise that content remains opaque,
or out-of-band.

But would that mean that you discount all the extensions to atom? Like
paging? atompub? None of these are mentioned in the spec for the atom media
type, but I would hardly characterize the use of them as opaque. Any
generic atom processor can work the documents and get a lot of value. Those
who know some extensions get a better experience than the rest.

Take HTML and the @profile attribute. It is an extension mechanism which
isn't visible in the HTTP headers; does that make using the profile
attribute less RESTful?

In any case, my point was to move the discussion from "is it RESTful" to
"is it useful".  OpenSearch is certainly useful, so are many of the atom
extensions out there. They often enable loose coupling in
machine-to-machine scenarios, where tight coupling is the norm.

The atompub extensions have their own media type: application/atom+xml;type=feed.  So things like paging are covered by that media type:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-10.1

By relying on format extensions which are not communicated, the coupling is tightened, not loosened.

How does the client signal to the server that it wants and understands the extended semantics? 

BTW, you mention in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-5.4 that the client has no way to request and the server no way to communicate that it supports atompub.  The atompub spec defines the application/atom+xml;type=feed media type (and others, such as service documents).  So I don't see a need for profiles there.

And there's no registered relation type with new/add/append-like

I think registering a link relation w/ the IANA that conveys the meaning of

it cannot (since profiles cannot change the media type semantics

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-3.1

"profile" to support what you're asking for, but that of course can only 
be done for existing media types if those media types are updated.

The atompub spec defines the application/atom+xml;type=feed media type (and others, such as service documents).  So I don't see a need for profiles there.

that's an interesting way to look at it. are you suggesting that if a 
feed is requested/served with application/atom+xml it should be 
considered a non-atompub feed, and if it's requested/served with 
application/atom+xml;type=feed it should be considered an 
atompub-capable feed? that's not how i have read the spec so far, but 
maybe that's what it says; anybody else having an opinion about this one?

Atompub allows adding a app:collection to any feed, allowing the semantics

Nor does such requirement exist.

&gt;
&gt; To be self-descriptive, to pick up on the theme from another thread,
&gt; the client has to request these semantics somehow, and the server has
&gt; to communicate the fact that they are being provided.  The RESTful
&gt; way to do this is not through sniffing, but media types.
&gt; 

I see nothing in the self-descriptive messaging constraint which
requires markup-language versioning to be expressed via media type.  To
me, REST is contained entirely within Dr. Fielding's dissertation,
including the definitions of terms used to distinguish one
architectural style from another.  There are other ways of doing
things, but if they require any redefinition of Roy's terms in order to
be considered RESTful, the disservice isn't being done to REST(tm), but
to REST's usefulness as an evaluation tool.

Nobody has to implement REST, but if your idiom is that of networked
hypertext systems, an understanding of where you are deviating from
REST and the consequences of same, is required.  We can't begin to
discuss the real-world consequences of overloading media type to
precisely capture the meaning of a hypertext interface, versus using
media type to identify a codec, unless we can agree that these are two
different approaches with different outcomes -- and thus worthy of
separate definitions so we can have that discussion using precise terms.

Which we can't do, if the starting point of the debate is that one of
these approaches just isn't RESTful enough, despite meeting Roy's
definition of self-descriptiveness, causing the discussion to degrade
into accusations of pedantry and un-usefulness.  Do what's best for your
system, whether the result is precisely RESTful or not isn't a value
judgment, it's an evaluation tool.  Instead of attempting to redefine
Fielding in an effort to attach the REST(tm) label, embrace REST the
tool by using Fielding's definitions to explain what tradeoffs you
made, and why you made them for the system in question.

REST is an idealized model, if fewer people would set it as a goal with
the naive expectation that real-world systems are even likely to fully
comply, we'd see less effort made to pass anything and everything off as
RESTful.

&gt;
&gt; If the client does request application/atom+xml and receives the
&gt; extension, no harm is done because of atom's must ignore model.
&gt; 

Graceful degradation doesn't harm any clients, right.

&gt;
&gt; If the client does request the extension via a custom media type, it
&gt; expects to be able to process the response based on the Content-Type
&gt; value returned.
&gt; 

Now you're talking about no degradation, as if the only clients that
care about your payload are privy to your application.  Having an
infinite number of finely-grained media types defeats the whole point
of self-descriptive messaging by actually reducing visibility, again
sticking with Roy's definition of terms.  One key to the successful
scaling of the Web has been the small number of ubiquitous, coarse-
grained media types.  This is a feature, not a bug; yes, there are
disadvantages, but it's a tradeoff we're willing to make in REST:

"The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades
efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form
rather than one which is specific to an application's needs."

Whether you are willing to make the same tradeoff in your system is for
you to decide, but it's incorrect to claim that using more application-
specific media types makes the result more RESTful (or self-descriptive,
or visible).  What this tradeoff allows, is for your system to scale by
targeting the deployed architecture of intermediaries which do all
sorts of wonderful things with your content based on the ubiquitous
markup you're using, and simply don't care about understanding any of
your domain-specific vocabulary.

The reason fine-grained media types exclude intermediary participation,
is because you've tightly coupled client to server.  As designed (by
which I mean coarse-grained), the concept of media types promotes loose
coupling.  This has led to a proliferation of intermediaries performing
every task under the sun nowadays, for billions of *different* systems
using essentially *the same* small number of ubiquitous media types.
Restricting intermediaries to only those which fully understand every
last bit of domain-specific vocabulary your system uses, completely
misses the point of REST as an architectural style, by lacking the
key ingredient for meeting REST's scalability goal (ubiquitous media
types).

Profile attributes, otoh, offer a reasonable compromise by more fully
describing the document semantics (not to be confused with self-
descriptive messaging, currently the most prevalent misconception of
REST out there imo) while still identifying the coarse-grained codec
wire-speed clients (by which I mean intermediaries) need to determine
if there's *anything* they can do with the payload, which likely has
nothing to do with the specifics of your application.

<pre>Hi,

Thanks for the feedback.

Mike, I've registered myself to the link-relations list. However I'd
like to continue the discussion here first.

On Fri, Aug 31, 2012 at 6:55 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:
&gt; I think registering a link relation w/ the IANA that conveys the meaning of
&gt; "use this URL to create a new resource of the type you are currently
&gt; viewing" would be valuable. I'd would prefer the value "create" over "add"
&gt; or "new" as I think it a broader value that covers not just adding new items
&gt; to a collection, but also creating new stand-alone content, etc.

I have previously designed and implemented a few "read-only" HTTP
API:s (as REST-ful as possible!) and I have only had the need for
using the methods GET HEAD and OPTIONS. This has made the linking
aspect of the API rather straight forward for me. I have been able to
use established link relation types without any significant problems.

However, now I'm designing a more interactive HTTP API for a
company-internal production system and I have the need for
creating/adding new resources. I now find that for more interactive
HTTP API:s there seems to be a lack of established link relation
types.

To elaborate a bit on you suggestion Mike, and based on my current
needs, I would like to propose:

1. "create": "Use this URL to create a new resource (possibly without
providing any data)".

2. "add": "Use this URL to add an existing resource by providing data".

3. "remove": "Use this URL to remove an existing resource".

4. "start": "Use this URL to start an 'execution' resource". Eg:
transaction, update, dump, backup etc. These resources are typically
transient. In my case I have an resource representing a ongoing
download of various data sets.

5. "stop": Use this URL to stop an execution resource".

All you need to know is that some resource has collection semantics, so you should tell the client that /photos is a collection rather than focussing on the action.


E.g. tell the client that /photos/ is the 'photos collection' (you can use a link rel for that, or, e.g. an AtomPub service document, or a specific media type you design) and that's it. That POST is for adding items is known from HTTP already.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Link relation for adding a resource<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>There are multiple ways to communicate interaction semantics of a problem
domain within a response:
1 - mapping via link decorator such as @rel, @id, @name, etc. (i.e.
rel="create" === add)
2 - mapping via document element (i.e. &lt;create href="..." ... /&gt; === add)
3 - mapping via protocol method (i.e. POST === add)
4 - mapping via resource identifier or identifier segment  (i.e.
/..../?create === add)

The first two possibilities offer the most flexibility and evolvability
over time since the client binds problem domain specifics to the response
details (deocrator/element) which may appear in any response sent over any
protocol using any identifier.

The second two possibilities offer the least flexibility and evolvability
over time since these solutions lead clients to bind problem domain
specifics to protocol-level details that are usually harder to change over
time and provide less portability (i.e. new protocols or identifier
schemes, etc.).

why do you think POST has create semantics? POST does not have any 
semantics other than doing something non-safe non-idempotent. while 
create fits that pattern, it's much more specific and not something that 
is in any way defined by HTTP itself.

&gt; All you need to know is that some resource has collection semantics, so you should tell the client that /photos is a collection rather than focussing on the action.

you're assuming that by exposing collection semantics this inherently 
means you can POST to create. again, that's not something that HTTP 
tells you. for example, AtomPub says that in order to create, you have 
to POST to an "edit" link, and not just to the collection itself. you 
could define a media type where the rule would be that you can always 
POST to a collection's URI to create a new resource, but that would be 
semantics defined by that media type, and not by HTTP itself.

cheers,

dret.

The original definition of POST was the same as NNTP: post an article
to a group (where group is the container identified by the target URI).
Hence, create a new resource under the target and respond with its
new URI in Location.

POST has strayed quite a bit since then.

I am interpreting POST along the lines Roy referred to ( "append" ) since that has arguably been blurred, my thinking seems 'wrong' in that sense.

Anyhow, you do not need to specify alink relation for adding items. it is sufficient to say that collections have that semantic. The use of POST follows naturally, because what else would you use? A client is free to try a PUT and will find out at run time whether that works.


&gt; POST does not have any 
&gt; semantics other than doing something non-safe non-idempotent. while 
&gt; create fits that pattern, it's much more specific and not something that 
&gt; is in any way defined by HTTP itself.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; All you need to know is that some resource has collection semantics, so you should tell the client that /photos is a collection rather than focussing on the action.
&gt; 
&gt; you're assuming that by exposing collection semantics this inherently 
&gt; means you can POST to create. again, that's not something that HTTP 
&gt; tells you. for example, AtomPub says that in order to create, you have 
&gt; to POST to an "edit" link, and not just to the collection itself.

Huh? Seems you are mixing editing with creating entries, or?

That aside, the interaction descriptions the AtomPub spec gives, are an over specification, because the server is free to do what it wants and the client has to be able to deal with that. Constraining the methods to use is a kind of coupling you cannot have (in a REStful system).

It is interesting that people usually seem to think specification of the method to use is necessary to implement clients and servers, but when you think about it, the choices are so limited that a developers knows the method to use anyhow.

Hints are good, but hey are just that, hints.

&gt; you 
&gt; could define a media type where the rule would be that you can always 
&gt; POST to a collection's URI to create a new resource, but that would be 
&gt; semantics defined by that media type, and not by HTTP itself.

Yes you could, but IMHO it's YAGNI and from a @RESTPOLICE POV, forbidden :-)

aren't you contradicting yourself a little bit here? it seems to me that 
above you're saying that a client needs to understand something is a 
collection (this would be signaled by the media type, right?) that might 
support POST. so we need this level of shared understanding, and i agree 
that one possible design is to not have an explicit link and instead say 
that "a create link is implied to the same URI, so that clients can try 
POST." but that needs to be specified somewhere, and it needs to be in 
the media type, right? the media type can use an "implicit link" ("use 
the same URI and POST to it") or an explicit one ("follow the 'create' 
link and POST to that URI"), but one way or the other, there is a "typed 
link" and there is a rule what HTTP method to use when following it.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Erik,
&gt;&gt;&gt; i'd suggest to use profiles
&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02) to signal that
&gt;&gt;&gt; overloading of the media type, and ideally a new version of OpenSearch
&gt;&gt;&gt; would make that explicit by adding a profile URI for OpenSearch.
&gt;&gt; How does the client signal to the server that it wants and understands the extended semantics?

&gt;it cannot (since profiles cannot change the media type semantics
&gt;retroactively), which is a disadvantage of profiles when they are used
&gt;in hindsight. however,
&gt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-3.1
&gt;suggests that media types SHOULD support a media type parameter
&gt;"profile" to support what you're asking for, but that of course can only
&gt;be done for existing media types if those media types are updated.

As I understand it, the values of media type parameters need to be registered as well (depending on the tree).
So a profile="http://example.com/foo" parameter+value pair could be added to a media type registration, 
so long as it doesn't impair backwards compatibility of the type/subtype.  Is that how you see it?

&gt;&gt; BTW, you mention in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-5.4 that the client has no way to request and the server no way to communicate that it supports atompub.  The atompub spec defines the application/atom+xml;type=feed media type (and others, such as service documents).  So I don't see a need for profiles there.

&gt;that's an interesting way to look at it. are you suggesting that if a
&gt;feed is requested/served with application/atom+xml it should be
&gt;considered a non-atompub feed, and if it's requested/served with
&gt;application/atom+xml;type=feed it should be considered an
&gt;atompub-capable feed? that's not how i have read the spec so far, but
&gt;maybe that's what it says; anybody else having an opinion about this one?

Yes, that`s pretty much how I've interpreted the format and protocol specs.  The format spec defines
the application/atom+xml media type for feeds and entries, while the protocol spec extends those with
;type=feed and ;type=entry, respectively.  As I see it, that would allow you to distinguish an atompub 
feed, from an feed that might or might not support paging.  I wasn't thinking about atom when the community was
thinking this out, though so it may not be as cut and dried as that.

Peter

&gt; yes, for media types where the profile information should become visible

&gt; a generic linking mechanism with "profile" relation type links), the
&gt; media type needs to be updated. afaict, there is no way how a media type

So, to bring this back around to the topic of the OP, are you suggesting using a profile link relation
as a RESTful mechanism to signal the extension of the atom media type?  If so, my take is that it's
not terribly RESTful, since the client can't request the media type with that profile.  So, while the
link relation (alone) would constitute a form of self-description, it can only be discovered after message reception
(unless the media type uses the profile parameter, as you mentioned), and as a result, tightens coupling
between clients which rely on that profile and the server which serves it.

That doesn't, of course, make it not useful.  HTML is extended every which way, and typically no signposts are
added to the message to indicate the nature of the extensions.  It might be useful in feeds to indicate that
they are georss-enabled, and which profile of georss, for example.

But IMHO, such extensions are not in the 'architectural style' of the web.

Peter

<pre>Hi Eric,

Thanks for your considered reply.  REST-Discuss is where I come to learn about REST from the best,
so this is a great place to have your understanding challenged and possibly learn something.

&gt;&gt; All that said, there is nothing about application/atom+xml which
&gt;&gt; implies this extension.
&gt;&gt;

&gt; Nor does such requirement exist.


My understanding is that application/atom+xml describes atom *without* extensions.  If you put extensions in,
to *any media type*, via either new markup or even changing the meaning of standard atom markup, you should change media types,
because it is the media type which names / describes the preferred semantics of the message, and it is
the message metadata which is the most authoritative on the web:

http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect.html


&gt; nothing in the self-descriptive messaging constraint which
&gt; requires markup-language versioning to be expressed via media type

I don't see it as versioning, although I suppose you could think of it that way. I was thinking about
registered mime types as the standard.  If you extend a standard, you need to document it.  But, if you
extend it without changing the string that invokes the standard preferred semantics, how to disambiguate the
extended semantics?


&gt; but it's incorrect to claim that using more application-
&gt; specific media types makes the result more RESTful (or self-descriptive,
&gt; or visible).

Mike A had a timely blog post related to this

http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/1136

In that post, he says this: This needs work as the word "standard" here is insufficiently defined.
What we're talking about here is related to what Mike was commenting on, the part of Roy's thesis where
it says " REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics "

So, given that not all semantics needed for a given interaction are described by a registered media type, we need to have
the ability to extend media types in order to describe semantics that are exchanged.

My personal understanding is that it is in this exact area where most "RESTful APIs" screw up: they exchange
messages using application/json, which says nothing besides "curly braces and arrays" (approximately) about their message.
Same for application/xml: "pointy brackets ahead" (again approximately).

FWIW, I'm not claiming to understand REST as a whole, and I rely on REST-Discuss to challenge my assertions, because otherwise,
people coming to REST-Discuss will receive bad information about what REST is or isn't.

So, my assertion is that, yes, it is necessary to engineer your media type to describe the message in order to be RESTful.  If you do not, you are not following a key constraint.   I see that as responding to bullet number 3 here:

http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven

Nor does such requirement exist.

&gt;
&gt; To be self-descriptive, to pick up on the theme from another thread,
&gt; the client has to request these semantics somehow, and the server has
&gt; to communicate the fact that they are being provided. The RESTful
&gt; way to do this is not through sniffing, but media types.
&gt;

I see nothing in the self-descriptive messaging constraint which
requires markup-language versioning to be expressed via media type. To
me, REST is contained entirely within Dr. Fielding's dissertation,
including the definitions of terms used to distinguish one
architectural style from another. There are other ways of doing
things, but if they require any redefinition of Roy's terms in order to
be considered RESTful, the disservice isn't being done to REST(tm), but
to REST's usefulness as an evaluation tool.

Nobody has to implement REST, but if your idiom is that of networked
hypertext systems, an understanding of where you are deviating from
REST and the consequences of same, is required. We can't begin to
discuss the real-world consequences of overloading media type to
precisely capture the meaning of a hypertext interface, versus using
media type to identify a codec, unless we can agree that these are two
different approaches with different outcomes -- and thus worthy of
separate definitions so we can have that discussion using precise terms.

Which we can't do, if the starting point of the debate is that one of
these approaches just isn't RESTful enough, despite meeting Roy's
definition of self-descriptiveness, causing the discussion to degrade
into accusations of pedantry and un-usefulness. Do what's best for your
system, whether the result is precisely RESTful or not isn't a value
judgment, it's an evaluation tool. Instead of attempting to redefine
Fielding in an effort to attach the REST(tm) label, embrace REST the
tool by using Fielding's definitions to explain what tradeoffs you
made, and why you made them for the system in question.

REST is an idealized model, if fewer people would set it as a goal with
the naive expectation that real-world systems are even likely to fully
comply, we'd see less effort made to pass anything and everything off as
RESTful.

&gt;
&gt; If the client does request application/atom+xml and receives the
&gt; extension, no harm is done because of atom's must ignore model.
&gt;

Graceful degradation doesn't harm any clients, right.

&gt;
&gt; If the client does request the extension via a custom media type, it
&gt; expects to be able to process the response based on the Content-Type
&gt; value returned.
&gt;

Now you're talking about no degradation, as if the only clients that
care about your payload are privy to your application. Having an
infinite number of finely-grained media types defeats the whole point
of self-descriptive messaging by actually reducing visibility, again
sticking with Roy's definition of terms. One key to the successful
scaling of the Web has been the small number of ubiquitous, coarse-
grained media types. This is a feature, not a bug; yes, there are
disadvantages, but it's a tradeoff we're willing to make in REST:

"The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades
efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form
rather than one which is specific to an application's needs."

Whether you are willing to make the same tradeoff in your system is for
you to decide, but it's incorrect to claim that using more application-
specific media types makes the result more RESTful (or self-descriptive,
or visible). What this tradeoff allows, is for your system to scale by
targeting the deployed architecture of intermediaries which do all
sorts of wonderful things with your content based on the ubiquitous
markup you're using, and simply don't care about understanding any of
your domain-specific vocabulary.

The reason fine-grained media types exclude intermediary participation,
is because you've tightly coupled client to server. As designed (by
which I mean coarse-grained), the concept of media types promotes loose
coupling. This has led to a proliferation of intermediaries performing
every task under the sun nowadays, for billions of *different* systems
using essentially *the same* small number of ubiquitous media types.
Restricting intermediaries to only those which fully understand every
last bit of domain-specific vocabulary your system uses, completely
misses the point of REST as an architectural style, by lacking the
key ingredient for meeting REST's scalability goal (ubiquitous media
types).

Profile attributes, otoh, offer a reasonable compromise by more fully
describing the document semantics (not to be confused with self-
descriptive messaging, currently the most prevalent misconception of
REST out there imo) while still identifying the coarse-grained codec
wire-speed clients (by which I mean intermediaries) need to determine
if there's *anything* they can do with the payload, which likely has

I don't think its a question of quantity, more of importance.  And importance 
is subjective.  If the extended semantics is important to a client, 
it will be requested, with Accept:.  If not, it won't. But if the 
extended semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of
delivery, and clients actually do end up using the extended semantics,
that is out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.

&gt; 
&gt; Only the publisher knows what the content means, so they get 
&gt; to decide which media type to use.

I believe that it is the published definition of the media type which is important, 
not the content.  A jpeg of my cat is not the same content as a jpeg of a supernova,
but they both may have the same media type definition.

On the application tree,  application/json or application/xml
would be sufficient for almost everything.  But they aren't, so we invent new
media subtypes to describe the markup.  Atom is one, but I don't think
it stops there, not by a long shot.  


YMMV

very well put! my rule of thumb is: if the content "makes sense" in the more generic type, use that one and make the extension semantics as easy to detect as possible (and "profile" is an attempt to provide such an easy way, reusable across media types). if the content is pretty much incomprehensible (such as RDF/XML served as application/xml), it provides little value (or even misleads clients) to even mention the more generic underlying media type. so far, it seems to me that this gives you a good starting point to decide how you want to satisfy the "self-describing" constraint.

You keep referring to the feed paging case, but it doesn't make any sense
to me.

RFC 5005 is the atom feed paging RFC, if I'm not mistaken, and it was
standardised _before_ AtomPub, RFC 5023. So this requirement that the
capability of paging be implied by clients requesting ;type=feed doesn't
make any sense.

A resource is rarely both a feed and an entry, and the introduction of the
type format was AFAICT done to make it easier to differentiate between the
two, NOT to imply conformance with AtomPub. Indeed, RFC 5023 states that:

"Producers of Atom Entry Documents SHOULD use the "type" parameter
regardless of whether or not it is mandatory. Producers of Atom Feed
Documents MAY use the parameter." [5023-12.1.1]

When you implement a component that speaks in terms of a standardized media
type, with known, standardized extensions, then there's no need for clients
to signal their support for this or that extension.

If, indeed each extension of Atom/AtomPub needed its own media type, why
don't any extensions define new media types?  Had they done so, a
proliferation of media types would ensue, and IMHO /that/  wouldn't be in
the spirit of the architcture of the web...

No server admin in their right mind would conneg between different dialects
of atompub, the way they did user-agent based HTML back in the last
decade...  Either an Atom feed has the extensions, or it doesn't. For a
feed with no next link, it's either there or not.

RFC 5005 even describes a new subtype of atom feeds, namely archived feeds,
with details on detection and semantics. All with the same media type.

&gt; But if the
&gt; extended semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of
&gt; delivery, and clients actually do end up using the extended semantics,
&gt; that is out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.

I disagree, based on the fact that Atom defines an open registry for link
relations, it adopts a "must-ignore" policy for elements that the agent
"does not understand", not for elements "not defined in this spec"

(earlier:)

&gt; If a client/processor is looking for the extended semantics
&gt; how does it request them?

It hopes that they're there. If not, it tries its best to complete its
task.  Just as you would if you were faced with a site that didn't use CSS,
and looked ugly, even though you happen to run a browser that /does/
support CSS.

<pre>Hi Erik,

Thanks for this feedback.

&gt; RFC 5005 is the atom feed paging RFC, if I'm not mistaken, and it was standardised _before_ AtomPub, RFC 5023.
&gt; So this requirement that the capability of paging be implied by clients requesting ;type=feed doesn't make any sense.

RFC 5005 does not address the atom media type, it is a link relation registration.  So it does not extend the
semantics of application/atom+xml, from my POV.  See below.

RFC 4287, section 2 states that entries and feeds are covered by the one media type.  But it pre-dates
RFC 5023 which I agree provides wiggle room around the type parameter.   Including the recommended
sniffing of the root element if the type parameter is not present, which might be considered a bad practice.
Indeed, if you went by only RFC 4287, you would be obliged to sniff the root element to determine how
to process the response.  I guess the fact that collections and members are sometimes distinct by their
context must have lead the collaborators on 4287 to conclude that further disambiguation was not necessary.

&gt; When you implement a component that speaks in terms of a standardized media type, with known,
&gt; standardized extensions, then there's no need for clients to signal their support for this or that extension.

Where the media type registration is updated by the extension, I agree. Otherwise, any extension anywhere could be
considered as part of that media type.  Even the overloading of link@length&lt;mailto:link@length&gt; via an email to REST-Discuss.

For example, the IANA registry lists both atom RFCs under the one registration, and the type parameter was specifically added
by the higher number RFC.  Therefore, clients that request and servers that serve that parameter can (should imho) be
reliably expected to understand and support the semantics of the later RFC.  The type parameter wiggle room is provided by the
later RFC in an effort to be backwards compatible, I think.  Backwards compatibility is a requirement of the
media type registration process, I believe.

&gt; If, indeed each extension of Atom/AtomPub needed its own media type, why don't any extensions define new media types?
&gt; Had they done so, a proliferation of media types would ensue

That is a good question.  I think additional parameter+values, such as 'profile=foo' could be useful in that regard.  Media type proliferation
would not be a problem if that was the mechanism used.  Processors which don't recognize a parameter are required to
ignore it.  So the original parent media type would not be obscured, which is a goal.  In fact, if your API uses some
custom extension which is specific to your API, why not signal /scope it by adding a custom parameter+value to the base
media type (profile=myapi)?  It is standard in the sense that the parent (standard) media type is not obscured.

&gt; But if the
&gt; extended semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of
&gt; delivery, and clients actually do end up using the extended semantics,
&gt; that is out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.

I disagree, based on the fact that Atom defines an open registry for link
relations, it adopts a "must-ignore" policy for elements that the agent "does not understand",
not for elements "not defined in this spec"

I don't understand the distinction you are making.  I think you're trying to say that any extension, defined anywhere, can be
an extension that a processor can follow.  Where is the standards in that?   If you don't think that's coupling,
we'll have to agree to disagree.  A better way IMHO would be to define and use a custom media type parameter as discussed
above.

Cheers,
Peter

I agree it consolidates useful information into one place; my concern
is that in making a standard link relation for how to convey overall message semantics, 
it undermines the role of the media type in web communications.  

&gt; 
&gt; it seems that what you're saying is that in order to be 
&gt; properly RESTful, each and every extension needs to mint a

A parameter would be preferable, as was done by AtomPub 'type'.

&gt; for GeoRSS feeds, and one for podcast feeds. and would you 
&gt; also have a media type for GeoRSS-enabled podcast feeds? and 
&gt; all other possible permutations of all extensions? 

I *like* the notion of using a standard media type parameter to
convey this information.  It does not obscure the original 
media type, and can / should be ignored by processors which
don't support the parameter.

&gt; and as long as these things are 
&gt; feeds (i.e., can be used as feeds and behave like feeds), i 
&gt; would argue they should be served as feeds.

I agree; consider: application/atom+xml;type=feed;profile="georss-gml"
it can still be used as an atom feed.

Conceptually, no, there's nothing wrong with including a list of
alternates using rel='alternate' in any media type which implements link
relations.  Which application/json doesn't, meaning your example doesn't
implement REST.  Sure, you can serialize Atom as JSON or XML, but the
results aren't self-descriptive, which violates the uniform interface
constraint.

The fix is to define a JSON serialization of Atom and register
application/atom+json for it; in the meantime, it's important to
understand where your system deviates from REST's idealized model.
It's become de rigeur to serialize Atom as JSON in this fashion, but it
doesn't meet Roy's definition of visibility, because everyone does it a
little bit differently while visibility is a product of standardization.

All those similar efforts slap application/json on it, which is truly
opaque because that media type doesn't define linking. Meaning the only
way to deduce "hey, this is Atom" is by sniffing the content and making
lots of assumptions about syntax.  Standardization is required for this
to become visible; even then, proliferation is required before REST's
benefits would be fully realized.

Using REST as an evaluation tool in this manner, presents you with two
options:  one, re-architect the system, if you need the full benefits of
REST from the get-go; or two, wait for the Web to catch up, participate
in the standardization process by writing an I-D for the Atom WG.  I'd
suggest, if you have to build your system this way, using a media type
of application/x.atom+json until such time as standardization occurs.

&gt;
&gt; Conceptually, no, there's nothing wrong with including a list of
&gt; alternates using rel='alternate' in any media type which implements link
&gt; relations.  Which application/json doesn't, meaning your example doesn't
&gt; implement REST.  Sure, you can serialize Atom as JSON or XML, but the
&gt; results aren't self-descriptive, which violates the uniform interface
&gt; constraint.
&gt;
&gt; The fix is to define a JSON serialization of Atom and register
&gt; application/atom+json for it; in the meantime, it's important to
&gt; understand where your system deviates from REST's idealized model.
&gt; It's become de rigeur to serialize Atom as JSON in this fashion, but it
&gt; doesn't meet Roy's definition of visibility, because everyone does it a
&gt; little bit differently while visibility is a product of standardization.
&gt;
&gt; All those similar efforts slap application/json on it, which is truly
&gt; opaque because that media type doesn't define linking. Meaning the only
&gt; way to deduce "hey, this is Atom" is by sniffing the content and making
&gt; lots of assumptions about syntax.  Standardization is required for this
&gt; to become visible; even then, proliferation is required before REST's
&gt; benefits would be fully realized.
&gt;
&gt; Using REST as an evaluation tool in this manner, presents you with two
&gt; options:  one, re-architect the system, if you need the full benefits of
&gt; REST from the get-go; or two, wait for the Web to catch up, participate
&gt; in the standardization process by writing an I-D for the Atom WG.  I'd
&gt; suggest, if you have to build your system this way, using a media type
&gt; of application/x.atom+json until such time as standardization occurs.

Decide whatever you want, provided you understand the ramifications.
Tools will eventually grok the +json media type suffix.  REST is about
long-term design, there's nothing wrong with having to wait a few years
for standardization to catch up. When it does you'll hopefully not have
painted yourself into a legacy-support corner, by failing to anticipate
change or planning how to accommodate it when it comes, in the design
phase.

&gt; 

I don't think there's much value to having multiple serializations,
seems more like something folks do in order to check boxes for feature
support, mostly.  If you're running an origin server and offering a
JSON serialization for Atom content, anyone building a client to consume
that JSON will have their client break if/when you change syntax to
support a standardized solution, due to tight coupling -- which isn't an
issue when standard media types are adhered to.

Whereas, if you only offer Atom, client developers can always add a
layer (using, say, XSLT) which transforms your Atom into their desired
JSON.  If/when a standardized solution to that problem evolves, the
client developer can decide whether or not to support it -- nothing
breaks, so you're not in a position where you need to support legacy
code by adding conneg on application/x.atom+json vs. application/atom+
json, which increases the complexity of your system.

I don't know your requirements, but I'd wait until the desired feature
(Atom serialized as JSON) actually exists before implementing it, rather
than trying to hit a moving target.  Once application/atom+json is
nailed down, it's easy enough to add in support to please client
developers, without the extra complexity of supporting legacy code.
Client developers can then remove their transformation layer, and change
their Accept: header to request atom+json instead of atom+xml.

In the meantime, there are benefits to be had from serving Atom as Atom,
which are a long ways off for Atom serialized as JSON.  Intermediaries
aren't just caches, those with knowledge of Atom can prefetch DNS
lookups, or atom:entry documents, or images etc. while third-party
systems (i.e. Google) know how to handle (index, subscribe to) your
data.  As a REST true believer, I don't see the benefit of trading away
this global, ubiquitous support of any system for the sake of easier
development of tightly-coupled clients.  Or, for byte shaving, which is
a moot point when compression and caching are considered.

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/8873

Put another way, REST enables serendipitous re-use by all sorts of apps
which have no knowledge of your system specifics.  Why give that up to
support the comparatively tiny number of applications developed
specifically for your system?  OK, sure, you can use conneg, but if the
tiny number of purpose-built clients accounts for most of your users
you're just shooting yourself in the foot -- their usage won't be
accelerated via serendipitous re-use, and will degrade cache efficiency
for any ubiquitous-media-type representations you're serving.

I think when Roy says "engineer for serendipity" it applies to runtime,
but is commonly misinterpreted to apply to design-time, which has led
lots of folks to implement multiple serializations.  I don't think Roy
means "make it easier for third parties to write clients" so much as
"support those clients already existing as part of the deployed
infrastructure" because that's what allows a system to truly scale.  By
doing so, your system will automatically support any new clients added
to the deployed infrastructure, which are based on the same standards
you've adhered to.  You don't need to know about them, and they don't
need to know about you, which sounds pretty serendipitous to me.

By clients, I mean both client connectors on intermediaries, and such
things as googlebot.  Target those by using ubiquitous media types which
properly describe the linking/embedding semantics of your data.

This is essentially what we do internally to support it. Default is normal atom.

There are of course trade offs. I like the x.json to at least make it
explicit what they are risking if they decide to use it.

is there an ongoing activity for this? afaict, many people want to use 
atom's model in JSON, and many create custom mappings. the problem with 
a standard is that atom is fairly tightly narrowed to XML, in particular 
when you look at its extension model, and it seems to me the two 
fundamental options you have are both not that appealing (which i think 
is why we do not have atom in JSON yet):

- leave out the complicated XMLy parts and end up with something that is 
only a subset of atom's model and thus cannot represent all possible 
atom+xml documents. not good.

- map everything to JSON and end up with sometimes horrible JSON, in 
particular when people use extensions and these extensions contain XML 
markup. not good.

i am just curious (because you recommended to "wait") how you think this 
dilemma will be solved, and whether you know about an activity where 
people are actively working on a solution.

thanks and cheers,

dret.

Putting alternate links in the body is ok, but putting them in the

particular flavor of JSON. Those clients are likely to be the ones
that need alternate links the most.

Also, you should strongly consider identifying your flavor of JSON
with a vendor media type. Doing so allows clients to request (and
interprete) its particular semantics. Having a specific media type is
particularly helpful if/when you are going to serve more than one
flavor of JSON. For example, if a standard atom+json ever really did
come to fruition you would probably want to support both, for a while

<pre>Thats already there I just posted one of the formats of atom that can be
gotten (+xml is also supported as is text + html) it depends what you send
in your accept header or url (yes I know this is "bad" but dealt with many
that have problems getting headers working in their environments)

The question was more is it worthwhile to send all of them if you have
already picked one but I guess its fine to send. Guess it makes sense
though that in some use case you could want one one way and another another
way.

Subject:category query hypermedia description<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

Atomserver uses category queries to allow filtering of feeds based on atom categories.
http://atomserver.codehaus.org/docs/categories.html#Queries

This is a really nice facility, but I am wondering how to describe it in hypermedia.
AtomPub says nothing about filtering, so this is left up to the reader.

Is a description of the format specification enough?  I don't think so, since what you
would want to do in a RESTful API is have forms or templates fed to the client which
would allow client-side URI generation based on rules embodied in the hypertext.

But is this impossible with prefix notation boolean logic?

Thanks for your ideas or comments!

&gt;&gt; &gt; My understanding is that application/atom+xml describes

&gt;&gt; via either
&gt;&gt; &gt; new markup or even changing the meaning of standard atom
&gt;&gt; markup, you
&gt;&gt; &gt; should change media types, because it is the media type
&gt;&gt; which names /
&gt;&gt; &gt; describes the preferred semantics of the message, and it is the
&gt;&gt; &gt; message metadata which is the most authoritative on the web:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That's not the case. It may well be the case for some -
&gt;&gt; text/plain comes to mind - but the majority of widely used
&gt;&gt; media types are designed well enough to accommodate
&gt;&gt; non-breaking extensions (where their introduction doesn't
&gt;&gt; affect the meaning of the core content).
&gt;
&gt; IOW when served with that media type messages are understood as that
&gt; media type.

Right.

&gt;  If a client/processor is looking for the extended semantics
&gt; how does it request them?

It doesn't, in general. If the extensions are standardized and have
value to the publisher (usually determined by the quantity/quality of
consumers), then the publisher will probably just provide them for
everybody since they're not interested in dealing with the complexity
of customizing responses for the specific needs of each client (again,
in general).

&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That said, there's some ambiguity here with regards to when
&gt;&gt; it makes sense to use a different (or new) media type. An SVG
&gt;&gt; document wrapped in "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" wouldn't be very useful
&gt;&gt; served with the text/html media type, for example.
&gt;
&gt; ??: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_svg.asp

Huh. Well, that example served me much better 10 years ago before
compound document features percolated to the mainstream. Though the
point remains for the moment, as I doubt all SVG clients are
HTML5-enabled in this way, meaning that as an SVG publisher (and that
sample document is, for all intents and purposes, SVG) I should still
be using image/svg+xml.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; But an
&gt;&gt; Atom document with a single entry extension from a foreign
&gt;&gt; namespace is still an Atom document because the spec
&gt;&gt; specifically accommodates such an extension; it should use
&gt;&gt; application/atom+xml.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that it _can_ use application/atom+xml, but in order
&gt; to convey extended semantics, paging for example, it would need to
&gt; use a different media type, application/atom+xml;type=feed in the
&gt; paging case.

That's the same media type; application/atom+xml in both cases. The
use of a media-type-specific parameter doesn't change the type. IIRC,
James Snell wanted a separate media type for Atom feeds vs. entries
and I came up with the compromise of the type parameter just so it
could be safely ignored in this way (or perhaps somebody came up with
it and I supported it, not sure).

&gt;
&gt;&gt; In between those two extremes, the
&gt;&gt; decision depends upon the specifics of the extensibility
&gt;&gt; features of the
&gt;&gt; type(s) in play, the importance and quantity of extended vs.
&gt;&gt; core content.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think its a question of quantity, more of importance.  And importance
&gt; is subjective.

Agreed, but IME, there's usually a correlation with quantity.

&gt;  If the extended semantics is important to a client,
&gt; it will be requested, with Accept:.  If not, it won't. But if the
&gt; extended semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of
&gt; delivery, and clients actually do end up using the extended semantics,
&gt; that is out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Only the publisher knows what the content means, so they get
&gt;&gt; to decide which media type to use.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that it is the published definition of the media type which is important,
&gt; not the content.  A jpeg of my cat is not the same content as a jpeg of a supernova,
&gt; but they both may have the same media type definition.
&gt;
&gt; On the application tree,  application/json or application/xml
&gt; would be sufficient for almost everything.  But they aren't, so we invent new
&gt; media subtypes to describe the markup.  Atom is one, but I don't think
&gt; it stops there, not by a long shot.

Well, those two types aren't sufficient, but for different reasons
than what I think you're talking about (search the archives for
application/xml)

Media types are not a type system of arbitrary granularity for your
application, just a simple, very coarse-grained way to associate some
content with a specification for its interpretation. You can of course
define them as granular as you like, but the less general they are,
the less appealing they are to support.

Abstract:
    This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that
    allows resource representations to indicate that they are following
    one or more profiles.  A profile is defined to not alter the
    semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients
    to learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions,
    extensions) that are associated with the resource representation, in
    addition to those defined by the media type and possibly other
    mechanisms.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My understanding is that application/atom+xml describes
&gt; &gt;&gt; atom *without*
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; extensions.  If you put extensions in, to *any media type*,
&gt; &gt;&gt; via either
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; new markup or even changing the meaning of standard atom
&gt; &gt;&gt; markup, you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should change media types, because it is the media type
&gt; &gt;&gt; which names /
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; describes the preferred semantics of the message, and it is the 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; message metadata which is the most authoritative on the web:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; That's not the case. It may well be the case for some - text/plain 
&gt; &gt;&gt; comes to mind - but the majority of widely used media types are 
&gt; &gt;&gt; designed well enough to accommodate non-breaking extensions (where 
&gt; &gt;&gt; their introduction doesn't affect the meaning of the core content).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IOW when served with that media type messages are 
&gt; understood as that 
&gt; &gt; media type.
&gt; 
&gt; Right.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  If a client/processor is looking for the extended 
&gt; semantics how does 
&gt; &gt; it request them?
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't, in general. If the extensions are standardized 
&gt; and have value to the publisher (usually determined by the 
&gt; quantity/quality of consumers), then the publisher will 
&gt; probably just provide them for everybody since they're not 
&gt; interested in dealing with the complexity of customizing 
&gt; responses for the specific needs of each client (again, in general).

The key point here is _standardized_, and the scope of that standardization.
If my API documents
a parameter for a media type, it is standardized within my API and the scope of that
standard is my API.  Clients exchange and know about the media type
by building to my API.

How does a client developer rely on an extension which is not registered
with the mime type standardization tree.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; That said, there's some ambiguity here with regards to 
&gt; when it makes 
&gt; &gt;&gt; sense to use a different (or new) media type. An SVG 
&gt; document wrapped 
&gt; &gt;&gt; in "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" wouldn't be very useful served with the 
&gt; text/html 
&gt; &gt;&gt; media type, for example.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ??: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_svg.asp
&gt; 
&gt; Huh. Well, that example served me much better 10 years ago 
&gt; before compound document features percolated to the 
&gt; mainstream.

Well this is an example of an evolving media type I guess.  But it is
documented, and text/html is currently understood to include historically
svg content (or content that looks a lot like svg, anyway).

Browsers have evolved along with the media type.

&gt; Though the point remains for the moment, as I 
&gt; doubt all SVG clients are HTML5-enabled in this way,

Shouldn't that be the other way round?  html clients being svg enabled?
I too doubt any svg clients are html enabled in this way.

&gt; meaning 
&gt; that as an SVG publisher (and that sample document is, for 
&gt; all intents and purposes, SVG) I should still be using image/svg+xml.

It is the html media type that is swallowing svg in this case.  I don't
know why they are doing this, but doubtless have some good reason.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; But an
&gt; &gt;&gt; Atom document with a single entry extension from a foreign 
&gt; namespace 
&gt; &gt;&gt; is still an Atom document because the spec specifically 
&gt; accommodates 
&gt; &gt;&gt; such an extension; it should use application/atom+xml.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree that it _can_ use application/atom+xml, but in 
&gt; order to convey 
&gt; &gt; extended semantics, paging for example, it would need to use a 
&gt; &gt; different media type, application/atom+xml;type=feed in the paging 
&gt; &gt; case.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the same media type; application/atom+xml in both 
&gt; cases. The use of a media-type-specific parameter doesn't 
&gt; change the type. 

No its not the same type it is a new type but if you don't understand
the parameter you should ignore it.  I am not 
an authority on media types and it is a subtle art from what I see.

For example, the fallback behaviour RFC 3023 suggested for '+xml' 
which has become de facto practice in other registrations, had 
already been built into MIME via parameters.  And I've
never seen a processor which didn't understand a */something+xml type
fallback to the */xml semantics.  I'd like to see that, if someone
is aware of such.

&gt; IIRC, James Snell wanted a separate media 
&gt; type for Atom feeds vs. entries and I came up with the 
&gt; compromise of the type parameter just so it could be safely 
&gt; ignored in this way (or perhaps somebody came up with it and 
&gt; I supported it, not sure).

OK, that's the history, thanks for that.  Good to know.  I would say
it worked out well, since the type parameter _can_ be used to
distinguish an atompub service, right?  IOW, if receive
a type parameter in the Content-Type, you know for sure the server
is at least aware of RFC 5023.

And if a client requests application/atom+xml;type=feed the server
(implementor) should realize that the client implementor is aware of
RFC 5023 and may be able to make good use of app:collection and
link@rel="next".




&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; In between those two extremes, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; decision depends upon the specifics of the extensibility 
&gt; features of 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; type(s) in play, the importance and quantity of extended vs.
&gt; &gt;&gt; core content.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't think its a question of quantity, more of importance.  And 
&gt; &gt; importance is subjective.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed, but IME, there's usually a correlation with quantity.




I don't know.  If you override the meaning of an attribute in atom,
can it still be safely processed as atom?  I know, you're going to 
say, depends on which attribute.  I'm not as strict in what I do 
as in what I tell others to do ;-).  Just trying to think it through!





&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  If the extended semantics is important to a client, it will be 
&gt; &gt; requested, with Accept:.  If not, it won't. But if the extended 
&gt; &gt; semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of delivery, 
&gt; &gt; and clients actually do end up using the extended 
&gt; semantics, that is 
&gt; &gt; out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Only the publisher knows what the content means, so they get to 
&gt; &gt;&gt; decide which media type to use.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe that it is the published definition of the media 
&gt; type which 
&gt; &gt; is important, not the content.  A jpeg of my cat is not the same 
&gt; &gt; content as a jpeg of a supernova, but they both may have 
&gt; the same media type definition.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the application tree,  application/json or 
&gt; application/xml would be 
&gt; &gt; sufficient for almost everything.  But they aren't, so we 
&gt; invent new 
&gt; &gt; media subtypes to describe the markup.  Atom is one, but I 
&gt; don't think 
&gt; &gt; it stops there, not by a long shot.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, those two types aren't sufficient, but for different 
&gt; reasons than what I think you're talking about (search the 
&gt; archives for
&gt; application/xml)
&gt; 
&gt; Media types are not a type system of arbitrary granularity 
&gt; for your application, just a simple, very coarse-grained way 
&gt; to associate some content with a specification for its 
&gt; interpretation. You can of course define them as granular as 
&gt; you like, but the less general they are, the less appealing 
&gt; they are to support.

Again, I'm not sure. I think media type design can scale, from my API
to the Web.  Not everyone on the Web will want to support my API,
but that's ok, too.

Thanks for the good conversation!

Peter

well-designed media types do not allow you to do this. you can extend 
such a media type, but if your extension is a "mustUnderstand", then 
you're messing with the foundation. then again, there are media types 
that have "mustUnderstand" semantics built into the foundation, so that 
an extension can signal what you can and cannot safely assume when 
you're not supporting the extension. atom has no such mechanism, and 
defining an extension that alter the semantics of atom markup would be 
bad design.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>dear link-relations experts,

this is a request to register 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-03 in the IANA link 
relations registry established by RFC 5988. the latest draft of the 
registration document is available at 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-03, and the last 
version announced on a variety of mailing lists has not generated any 
feedback asking for changes.

should the registration request be accepted, my understanding is that 
the draft registration document will be forwarded to IANA for 
registration by a designated expert.

thanks a lot and kind regards,

Subject:Re: Bookmark 'stability'<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I see that nobody mentions link relations.
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#link-type-bookmark defines the "bookmark" relation.

Indeed, the server cannot control whether a URI is bookmarked or not, but it should definitely advertise its capabilities. In this case, the capability of maintaining a URI as an entry point for resource X "forever".

The only resource that has the bookmark contract from the start is the API's entry point (root). For the rest, may them be of type bookmark or not, the client needs to know the freedoms and responsibilities it has for bookmarking them.

The whole idea of a REST API is to reduce coupling. Why create unnecessary URI coupling?

Yes, and generally, a client can (und often will - look at your bookmarks folder :-) bookmark any URI for later use as an entry point.

&gt; 
&gt; The whole idea of a REST API is to reduce coupling. Why create unnecessary URI coupling?

Bookmarking is an inherent aspect of RESTful systems. Bookmarking is not coupling. It is the other way round: because clients will bookmark, servers pretty much have an implicit obligation to maintain URIs over time once they 'got out'.

May question was circeling around the issue whether this ws more true for some URIs than for others.

more true for some URIs? yes, for those marked "bookmark"
I don't see that, as a server, I have more of an obligation to maintain an
URI (that is not marked "bookmark"), than maintaining resource state
(ludicracy intended).

It's been there from day one:

It's a best practice resulting from TBL intentionally dropping referential integrity.

Consider this:

Suppose Joe developer is facing the task of changing some server implementation. Is he free to drop all previous URIs and come up with a bunch of new ones?

Free? yes, but a good idea? No.

Why? Bookmarking!

And there's your best practice already. I simply aim to make people aware of it.

It seems like you made up your mind, so I can only wish you luck with
maintaining your API URIs and I'll move on.
But just so I understand, you will look at your access.log and see

127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif
HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 "http://www.example.com/start.html" "Mozilla/4.08 [en]

127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:37 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif
HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 "" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)"

(one with a referrer and one without, assuming that the referrer will make
the split between non- and bookmarked URIs, or is there another way?)
and you will tell yourself "ok, I need to maintain /apache_pb.gif forever"?

It's still not clear why you believe bookmarking is not coupling:

"A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious
coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control
their own namespace."

A server that is obligated to keep all its URIs "stable" is not a server
that has freedom to control its own namespace.

Thanks :-)  But, after all, maintaining URIs is cheap.

&gt; and I'll move on.
&gt; But just so I understand, you will look at your access.log and see
&gt; 
&gt; 127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 "http://www.example.com/start.html" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)"
&gt; 
&gt; 127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:37 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 "" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)"
&gt; 
&gt; (one with a referrer and one without, assuming that the referrer will make the split between non- and bookmarked URIs, or is there another way?)
&gt; and you will tell yourself "ok, I need to maintain /apache_pb.gif forever"?

No, I am more thinking along the lines of using the timing pattern to determine which URIs are the staring point of interactions from one steady state to another steady state. E.g when I see 

  GET URI-1
   &lt;50 milli seconds&gt;
  GET URI-2
   &lt;50 milli seconds&gt;
  GET URI-3
   &lt;1 hour seconds&gt;
  GET URI-4

from the same  IP (or visitor if IP is not enough)

I'd probably think that URI-1 and URI-4 are URIs of 'bookmark-like' interest to the client.

Anyhow, what Mark meant, IIUC, is that the access log can be harvested for navigation patterns that allow such conclusions to be made.

If all my clients frequently start froma steady state using URI-4 it worth maintaining it, eh?

Subject:Non-Equivalent Retries<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I have been having some discussions lately with people about retries
in a restful system and whether or not its appropriate for the caller
to specify that it is a retry.

The specific situation is that in a particular kind of post we can be
very expensive to assure idempotency. A retry flag on retries would
make us hit this expensive logic only if it were actually a retry.

I can see both sides of the discussion. Setting a retry flag on a
retry actually makes it a new message not a retry of the existing one.
However there would seem to be many places where knowing something is
a retry can be valuable (we have another place where over our custom
TCP protocol if we retry from a master node to another node we mention
"by the way we think he might be dead" which can speed up the finding
of dead master nodes.

Back to the specific situation. What would happen is the client could
still retry in a normal form but would receive a lower idempotency
contract (eg it doesnt break say a browser use case, you just get a
lower contract if you don't understand the concept of a retry). In
particular retries are assured to be idempotent for a period of time
where as if you can specify that its a retry we can give pure
idempotency.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Greg

Title:		 The 'describes' Link Relation Type
Creation date:	 2012-09-22
WG ID:		 Individual Submission
Number of pages: 6
URL: 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilde-describes-link-01.txt
Status:          http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wilde-describes-link

Abstract:
    This specification defines the 'describes' link relation type that
    allows resource representations to indicate that they are describing
    another resource.  In contexts where applications want to associate
    described resources and description resources, and want to build
    services based on these associations, the 'describes' link relation
    type provides the opposite direction of the 'describedby' link
    relation type, which already is a registered link relation type.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>tried to digest this over and over again, and failed.

#1 is there somewhere that says that a describedby link should be
dereferenced _automatically_ when encountered? (that is what you're saying,
right? i mean, you should be able to dereference all links)

#2
Relation Name: describedby

Description: The relationship A "describedby" B asserts that
resource B provides a description of resource A. There are no
constraints on the format or representation of either A or B,
neither are there any further constraints on either resource.

This description makes me think that although describedby is not very
specific, it can be very well used to point out what type of constraints
this resource/media-type abides (e.g. json schema) - while you could very
well have only a literal description in plain text.

#3 when you say " the intention is not that clients should follow that
link; the semantics are in the identifier itself", I guess you refer to
both a link with rel=profile (in the Link header or in the payload), and to
the profile param of a media-type ?
I can understand that as a param to a media-type, it acts as an identifier,
just like the media-type itself "application/json" or
"application/vnd.andrei+json"
but as a link, it has to be "deference-able", so that the client can follow
it. Otherwise, and maybe I am wrong, but it is not a link anymore.

#4 "resource follows additional conventions"
If I have a media-type "application/vnd.andrei+json" - which under
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-media-type-suffix-regs-04means
that it has JSON syntax, and some additional semantics of
"vnd.andrei". Accepting such a media-type means that the client is already
aware of such syntax and semantics, so pointing the client to "additional
conventions" is not really the term here. Instead I would say that this
link (may it be describeby or profile) is a description of those
conventions which are already shared between server and client i.e. a json
schema of application/vnd.andrei+json


Thanks for sharing some knowledge.
Sorry if I'm not seeing some trivial things.

the assumption for 'describedby' is that when you follow the link, you 
find a description resource. there is no such thing as 'automatic link 
following', but the link relation can tell you what typical interactions 
look like. for 'describedby', it's following the link. for 'profile', 
it's comparing the link target to known identifiers. maybe reading 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#profiles helps?

&gt; This description makes me think that although describedby is not very
&gt; specific, it can be very well used to point out what type of constraints
&gt; this resource/media-type abides (e.g. json schema) - while you could

yes, it could. and there's always some leeway in deciding how generic a 
link relation should be (you want some level of reusability, but also 
some level of defined semantics). you could use 'describedby' to link to 
schemas/types, like you say, and we're actually having an internal 
discussion whether we'd like to use describedby for exactly that purpose 
or not, but there's no single correct answer here.

&gt; #3 when you say " the intention is not that clients should follow that
&gt; link; the semantics are in the identifier itself", I guess you refer to
&gt; both a link with rel=profile (in the Link header or in the payload), and

i refer to wherever that link relation is used.

&gt; I can understand that as a param to a media-type, it acts as an
&gt; identifier, just like the media-type itself "application/json" or
&gt; "application/vnd.andrei+json"
&gt; but as a link, it has to be "deference-able", so that the client can
&gt; follow it. Otherwise, and maybe I am wrong, but it is not a link anymore.

a link establishes a (typed) relationship between two identified 
resources. whether the URIs can/should be dereferenced or not is a 
separate issue.

&gt; #4 "resource follows additional conventions"
&gt; If I have a media-type "application/vnd.andrei+json" - which under
&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-media-type-suffix-regs-04
&gt; means that it has JSON syntax, and some additional semantics of
&gt; "vnd.andrei". Accepting such a media-type means that the client is

&gt; say that this link (may it be describeby or profile) is a description of
&gt; those conventions which are already shared between server and client
&gt; i.e. a json schema of application/vnd.andrei+json

if you have a media type and that's all you need, then you don't need 
profiles. if you have a media type that has some openness to it and you 
want a way how to communicate about how this openness is used, then 
maybe profiles can be useful for you. again, consider HTML's example.

cheers,

dret.

<pre>Hi all,

&gt; "Cool URIs don't change" is not a RESTful principle.

If there’s no stability, how can a REST system possibly work?
Okay, right, hypermedia… (assuming that at least the starting URI remains stable)
but we can't expect clients to navigate to the desired resource every time again, can we?

And, also:
“The naming authority that assigned the resource identifier, making it possible to reference the resource, is responsible for maintaining the semantic validity of the mapping over time (i.e., ensuring that the membership function does not change).”
(http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1)

A 404 certainly changes the membership function if the resource is still accessible through another URI.

Subject:The object-resource impedance mismatch<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi there,

We’re all familiar with the the differences between objects from programming languages
and resources used in a REST environment.

A good understanding of the resources-and-representations model is required
to develop a REST application, but many many implementations stick too hard
to the used technologies (which makes us end up with, for example, RPC-style).

Instead of explaining how to model an object-oriented schema as an HTTP article,
I decided to do it the other way round and show how to model HTTP in JavaScript.
You can see the results at
http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2012/09/27/the-object-resource-impedance-mismatch/

I’m looking forward to your comments and suggestions.

Best,

&gt; In theory, yes, in in practice, no.  A server is likely to make some
additional URIs bookmarkable along the client's journey through its
hypermedia; staging posts, if you will.

I like the idea that came up on a thread here recently (new to me if not
anyone else) that the "bookmark" rel is used to indicate this.

In HTTP you can always redirect using the status codes:

301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
303 See Other
307 Temporary Redirect
308 Permanent Redirect (experimental)

Clients (that understand HTTP) can then make different decisions
depending on the type of redirect, like for example, updating a
bookmark (automatically or interactively with an end user).

This gives HTTP servers/applications the freedom to control their own
name space and a way to communicate those changes to HTTP clients.
Well behaved HTTP clients handle this intelligently.

Finally resources may actually disappear as part of the business logic
that the system supports. So requesting some URI:s will simply return
404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone). Clients simply have to deal with that.

I think that HTTP "works" for the Web! ;-)

<pre>Hi Paul,

&gt;&gt;&gt; "Cool URIs don't change" is not a RESTful principle.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If there’s no stability, how can a REST system possibly work?
&gt; 
&gt; In HTTP you can always redirect using the status codes:

That means we agree, because, to return a status code for a certain URI,
it has to remain stable.
E.g., if the original URI is /things/a and the new one is /things/b,
then a 30x to /things/b is perfectly acceptable
and makes /things/a still al Cool URI,
because it still has the same mapping (although with different mechanics).

What, however, would not be cool,
is if /things/a gave a 404,
but /things/b happily provided the resource.
This would mean that the semantic validity of the /things/a mapping has not been maintained.

&gt; Finally resources may actually disappear as part of the business logic
&gt; that the system supports. So requesting some URI:s will simply return
&gt; 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone). Clients simply have to deal with that.

If they disappear, than a 404/410 is acceptable
and it is *still* a Cool URI, because it correctly tells that the resource does not exist anymore.

Moral of the story:
a URI should maintain same mapping for its entirely lifetime,
although the mapped resource and its state my change over time.

Best,

Ruben

The HTTP spec says that for 301 (Moved Permanently):

"The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned
URIs."

and the spec for HTTP status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect) says:

"The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned
URIs.

I'm not sure what the practical convention for 301, or 308, is, but to
me it sounds like the server could chose to return a 404 or maybe more
appropriately a 410 (Gone) in the future.

The idea is to tell the client that the resource is still there, but that the client should use another URI to interact with it.

The redirect should stay (instead of 410) because the resource is still there - just somewhere else.

<pre>&gt; I'm not sure what the practical convention for 301, or 308, is, but to
&gt; me it sounds like the server could chose to return a 404 or maybe more
&gt; appropriately a 410 (Gone) in the future.

No 410 at least, because 410 means:
“The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known.”
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.11)

Note how it says “at the server”, which means that a forwarding address should necessarily be on another server.
So 410 seems not acceptable if the resource has changed URI but is still on the server.

404 is, however, more vague:
“The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.”

Best,

1. start with known resource

Works really well… until the resource whose URI changed is not in step 3, but step 1.

This is exactly why we have (private) caching. You can traverse over
resources without actually hitting the network.

&gt; 1. start with known resource
&gt; 2. follow hypermedia links
&gt; 3. end at desired resource
&gt; Works really well… until the resource whose URI changed is not in step 3, but step 1.

Hence why we have 'entry points' which /are/ the stable URIs of a
hypermedia application. This is what distinguishes them as an entry
point - they are an resource a client can assume exists (i.e.
bookmark). If every URI in your app was supposed to be bookmarkable
then the term 'entry point' would be meaningless.

Not really. I’d like to bookmark posts or comment from a blog,

By the way… why would anybody be against stable URIs?

Of course it depends on the practical situation, but it may very well
complicate software and data maintenance of the server. And how long
time is implied by "stable"? A year, 10 years, 100 years, the life
span of the system?

A server should commit itself to some "official URI:s", or entry
points. But forcing a server to commit itself to maintaining all URI:s
that have ever been published to any client seems to me like
introducing unneccesary coupling.

It invalidates the term 'entry point' entirely. If you are allowed to

entry point, at which point stating that your blog index is an entry

I’d argue that the definition of “entry point” depends on the client.
If the client never visited the blog, the index is the only entry point.
If it has, then other entry points come available.

Yep - any URI can be an entry point if the client wants to.

Some URIs make better ones than others, of course.

Bute surely, any product-URI at Amazon is as good to enter a purchase as is the Amazon homepage.

Yes there is a lot of bookmarking on the human web, and lots of entry
points. Humans also happen to be naturally very good at dealing with
failure so the risks are far lower in a web app than in an 'API' since
the odds of recovery are higher i.e. this is more of a concern when
the consumers of your app are automatons.

Saying something in your API is bookmarkable makes it an entry point,
and brings a cost. If you decide that cost is worth it for a
particular set of resources that is absolutely fine, and for some
applications it might be decided that is a majority of the resources..
but that doesn't mean that all resources in every API should be
bookmarkable, it depends on the API and what you are trying to
achieve.

Non-bookmarkability is fine for resources that don’t exist anymore. I don’t expect the server to keep everything.
For resources that still exist… no reason to change the URI every now and then. It’s part of a good resource design.

Retracing the hypermedia trail to reset a busted bookmark when it becomes
is a Good Thing, but it is not always easy or even doable.

Some interactions which are simply repeatable. Ie, I go to bookstore api,
pick the most popular book today and bookmark it. The every day the app
checks and record its popularity so that I can see the trend over time. If
that bookmark stops working the app is pretty much screwed.

Retracing gets even harder if you have more than two components in the
distributed system. For example, say component A finds a resource and
passes its uri -- and by dong so effectively bookmarks the resource -- to
component B for future processing. If the uri stops working component B has
no way of acquiring the newer uri for the resource in question since only
component A knows what hypermedia trail should be followed.

In both of these hypothetical situations the entry point is the bookmarked
uri and there is no obvious way for the clients to automatically use any
other entry point. There many more situations like this once you get into
building real applications.

Really? (Talk about trolling.) How would you deal with the situation
where a uri is acquired from search results? Search results change
fairly often if you use modern search technologies like lucene, etc
and are certainly not guaranteed to stay the same if new items are
added that match the query. How should we procede when the client is
given a url by a user or a third component of the (distributed)
system? Surely we don't want to implement existing capabilities just
so that we have all the information to refollow a hypermedia trail.
The whole point of this exercise is to leverage the work and data of
existing system.

&gt;&gt; There many more situations like this once you get into building real
&gt;&gt; applications.

Subject:discovering "alternate" representations?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Folks;

trying to build REST resources that make heavy use of delivering 
different representations of binary files, I ended up looking for 
thoughts on how to deal with alternate representations of a resource in 
different media types.

To outline the issue in a simple example: Imagine instructions on how to 
assemble a piece of furniture bought in some large store. These 
instructions are made available, say, as "text/html" (written 
description of what to do), "application/pdf" (step-by-step instructions 
in illustrations) and "application/mp4" (video showing what needs to be 
done).

All the things basically represent the same resource, the same content, 
in just different representations. There's two things that make me think:

- As far as I understood content negotiation by now, this is sort of a 
client-driven procedure: Client provides a more or less lengthy weighted 
Accept: header, server delivers the kind of representation content type 
that seems to suit the client best, based upon Accept:, language, and of 
course the kind of stuff the server is capable of providing, after all. 
While this is neat when making client and server quietly make up whether 
to transfer and render image/gif or image/png, it seems to fall short in 
a case as the one outlined before. Here, I would kind of expect a 
standards based approach allowing for the client to determine which kind 
of representations a server is capable to provide, to by then know 
"there's text, there's a pdf, and there's a video clip of the same 
content, too". What is the best way of dealing with such a requirement, 
both in terms of interoperability and in terms of "clean-ness of design"?

- Right now, I make use of Atom &lt;entry&gt;'s and rel="alternate" links to 
keep such things together. Apart from at least _feeling_ a bit strange 
(now the different "representations" of the same thing are linked as 
"alternate" from an Atom &lt;entry&gt; which does not represent but just 
describe that actual resource) I am left with another question: Right 
now, with this approach, I easily can provide a client system with the 
information which media type representations are available for that very 
resource. However this just (obviously) works whenever accessing the 
&lt;entry&gt; resource first, to by then see a structure like

http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table

having link rel="alternate" to

http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.mp4
http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.pdf
http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.txt

which works. However, in such a situation, to tell which alternate 
representations are there, I always will have to access the

http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table

resource first, which means that I have to know this one. I so far 
haven't figured out an obvious, portable way how to, in example starting 
out with the "application/pdf" representation, tell that there are 
alternative media type representations available, as well.

Hmm. Maybe I am missing something essential / fundamental / trivial 
about that, or I made a fundamental mistake in thinking about my 
resource design. Inspirations / thoughts, anyone?

TIA and all the best,
Kristian

<pre>consider:

1) use link headers with the response that return the list of all other
representations for the current response (work on rel values for this)

2) support for an OPTIONS call for the current URI that return the list of
possible reprsentations for the current response

3) arrange a client-drive negotiation model where the server returns 300 w/
a list of possible representations and the client picks which it wants this

each has pros/cons, but none of the options are dependent upon a particular
media type or canonical URI as a starting point.

hope this gives you some ideas.

&gt; &gt; trying to build REST resources that make heavy use of delivering

&gt; &gt; different media types.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To outline the issue in a simple example: Imagine instructions on how to
&gt; &gt; assemble a piece of furniture bought in some large store. These
&gt; &gt; instructions are made available, say, as "text/html" (written

&gt; &gt; done).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All the things basically represent the same resource, the same content,
&gt; &gt; in just different representations. There's two things that make me think:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - As far as I understood content negotiation by now, this is sort of a
&gt; &gt; client-driven procedure: Client provides a more or less lengthy weighted
&gt; &gt; Accept: header, server delivers the kind of representation content type
&gt; &gt; that seems to suit the client best, based upon Accept:, language, and of
&gt; &gt; course the kind of stuff the server is capable of providing, after all.
&gt; &gt; While this is neat when making client and server quietly make up whether
&gt; &gt; to transfer and render image/gif or image/png, it seems to fall short in
&gt; &gt; a case as the one outlined before. Here, I would kind of expect a
&gt; &gt; standards based approach allowing for the client to determine which kind
&gt; &gt; of representations a server is capable to provide, to by then know
&gt; &gt; "there's text, there's a pdf, and there's a video clip of the same
&gt; &gt; content, too". What is the best way of dealing with such a requirement,
&gt; &gt; both in terms of interoperability and in terms of "clean-ness of design"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Right now, I make use of Atom &lt;entry&gt;'s and rel="alternate" links to
&gt; &gt; keep such things together. Apart from at least _feeling_ a bit strange
&gt; &gt; (now the different "representations" of the same thing are linked as
&gt; &gt; "alternate" from an Atom &lt;entry&gt; which does not represent but just
&gt; &gt; describe that actual resource) I am left with another question: Right
&gt; &gt; now, with this approach, I easily can provide a client system with the
&gt; &gt; information which media type representations are available for that very
&gt; &gt; resource. However this just (obviously) works whenever accessing the
&gt; &gt; &lt;entry&gt; resource first, to by then see a structure like
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; having link rel="alternate" to
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.pdf
&gt; &gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.txt
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; which works. However, in such a situation, to tell which alternate
&gt; &gt; representations are there, I always will have to access the
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; resource first, which means that I have to know this one. I so far

<pre>yep, using canonical is good, esp. in cases where you
have multiple representations.

my point was to give you a way to get all other options within easy reach.
you can mark one of them canonical, too.

Thanks for pointing me there. The approach outlined in there seems
definitely reasonable, and I will definitely take a look in implementing
this, eventually based upon header fields to work with binary resources,
too. However:

point of view, talking about various software systems accessing these 
resources, including browsers? I.e. it seems people are pretty much 
reluctant to using / implementing OPTIONS, for whichever reasons.

<pre>Hi,

What about the opposite direction relation?  So you are viewing the representation at the canonical URI, and there is a (templated) link to (all) the alternates.  So far I am calling this  link@rel="api",  but I also thought of "views".  "alternates" might also work, but it is as non-standard as the others.

Cheers,
Peter

yep, using canonical is good, esp. in cases where you have multiple representations.

my point was to give you a way to get all other options within easy reach. you can mark one of them canonical, too.

As I understand it, 'describedby' relates to the *resource* while
'profile' relates to the *representation* and the two should not be
mixed.  I may have one 'describedby' linked to by each variant (conneg)
of a resource, which says nothing about document syntax, while each
variant is a different media type -- with or without a profile saying
nothing descriptive about the resource, only the syntax used by that
particular representation.

So the difference is inherent in the protocol's separation of resource
from representation, and has nothing to do with whether either relation
type is meant to be dereferenced or treated as an identifier.

I have no idea where participants in this thread are getting this
notion.  In the case of an excerpt of one document appearing in
another, rel='bookmark' identifies a permalink, is all.  When appearing
in the &lt;head&gt; of a transient message, say a purchase confirmation from

&gt; bookmark or not, the client needs to know the freedoms and

&gt; 

I know of no such contract.  Nor does REST endorse an "entry point" for
any API.  I see a whole lot in this thread that folks are reading in to
REST, which is really neither here nor there.  To be continued...

No way.  If I merge one article into another, what do I do with the old
URI?  HTTP has no semantics of "has been merged" and clearly redirection
would change the semantics of the mapping of the obsolete URI.  There's
nothing wrong with returning 404 with a helpful message body and a link
to the merged resource.  Or a search interface, with a keyword or two
filled out, even.  About the only unRESTful option would be a 404
without so much as a rel='home' in its &lt;head&gt;, i.e. no hypertext
provided for advancing application state.

Asking the user what to do isn't unRESTful, but I think you M2M guys
lose sight of that in pursuit of automation...

Not as cheap as obsoleting them.  The number-one ongoing maintenance
issue for any Web Developer shop, is external links.  My biggest gripe
over the years is findlaw.com, they change their API all the damn time.

I definitely incur a cost in maintaining URIs when I take over a website
for a client; like as not, I'll want to change the URI allocation
scheme, and implement redirection for the old one.  If other developers
would just do the same, I wouldn't have to assign a lackey to run a link

maintain.

&gt; bookmark).
&gt;

This notion of 'entry points' is a common misconception about REST.
The 'bookmark' relation is not a declaration of status.  Every
representation in a REST application is a potential entry point, that's
what the hypertext constraint is all about -- there's no set application
flow.

Think of a shopping cart app -- I may go back and change the ship-to
address at a later point than I was initially asked, whereas you did
not.  I may have entered from a product page, whereas you may have
entered from a special-offer ad.  Does the fact that we used different
starting points and followed a different path through the process, mean
we used separate shopping-cart apps?

Roy's whole point with bookmarking is to contrast with the RPC style,
where you can't go back and edit a ship-to address, you can only go
back to step one and repeat the whole process.  I may bookmark the
"payment" page because the wife's out shopping with the credit card, so
I want to come back later and *that* is my entry point.

&gt;
&gt; If every URI in your app was supposed to be bookmarkable then the
&gt; term 'entry point' would be meaningless.
&gt; 

But it *is* meaningless to a RESTful system, which is my whole point in
this thread.

I mean that *forcing* a server to commit itself to maintaining URI:s

404:s. I mean that having a requirement on the (developers of the)

have the server return 404:s is an example of coupling. I am aware
that there are many more aspects of coupling.

server-side application is free to do what it wants.

It is coupling by virtue of *forcing* the server to maintain URI:s
that the developers wish to remove.

Of course, for practical purposes, any server that wishes to be polite
and keep clients happy should take care to at least maintain some well
known server URI:s.

Maintaining obsolete URIs is not an example of "coupling" as applies to
REST.  REST isn't "decoupled" but rather, "loosely coupled" around
standardized data types.  The more obscure the data type, the tighter
the coupling.  The more ubiquitous the data type, the looser the
coupling.  What's being discussed is the degree of coupling between
client and server, not server and Web Developer.  It gets very confusing
when participants in a discussion introduce their own definitions of
terms.

It is an incredibly clear violation of servers controlling their own
namespace. Seriously. I don't even know why this is contentious.

&gt; A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media types and link relations. [Failure here implies that clients are assuming a resource structure due to out-of band information, such as a domain-specific standard, which is the data-oriented equivalent to RPC's functional coupling].

"coupling" and different aspects of coupling with regards to REST and
web can be found here:

  https://wiki.kuali.org/download/attachments/140968166/LooseCoupling.pdf

The original thread began with Jan Algermissens question "Should all
URIs a server makes known to clients be considered possible bookmarks?
If not, how do I differentiate between those that are and those that
are not?"

I think that all URI:s returned by a server should be considered
bookmarkable by clients! However, this being the distributed web,
clients should not make any assumptions on those URI:s being valid for
all time (amen), but instead be prepared for getting a redirect or
even a 404 next time they dereference the URI. A polite server will of
course redirect if possible but is not *required* to do so.

Ideally a server API has only one entry point URI, but for practical
purposes I think it is reasonable in many cases to have a set of entry
URI:s. Actually this set of URI:s could just as well be considered a
set of different server API:s! These URI:s can be differentiated
simply by virtue of them being published as "official" entry URI:s.

&gt; It is an incredibly clear violation of servers controlling their own
&gt; namespace. Seriously. I don't even know why this is contentious.
&gt; 

Wow, no, that isn't what Roy meant at all.  An example of a server not
controlling its own namespace, is one which must for one reason or
another support "/well-known".  Or, one which supports an API with an
entry point which must be called "/entrypoint" on any server which
implements it.  Or find customers by plugging an ID into "/customer".
These are not RESTful concepts -- in REST, hyperlinks drive application
state, and "/customer" could just as easily be "/foo", the name of the
directory is irrelevant to the API because it's provided in hypertext,
not API documentation.

OTOH, supporting an old URL because people have bookmarked it, is
clearly up to the developer.  And, as it can be implemented in DNS as a
redirect, has nothing to do with the web server's namespace.  It's a
design choice which is not, repeat not, in violation of any REST
constraint.  This meme that supporting old URLs amounts to coupling,
needs to be killed off, now.

No, it isn't.  Does the system work with the new URLs?  Then it isn't
dependent on the old ones.  Are they supported for user convenience?
That would be the server controlling its own namespace.

&gt; 

OMG, standardized media types are a key concept of REST, time to read
the thesis again.  The whole point of "visibility" is the re-use of
standardized protocol elements, i.e. registered headers and media types.
Using an unregistered media type is not visible, therefore it induces
tight coupling between client and server.  HTML is ubiquitous and
standardized, making it visible, so a server using it is not tightly
coupled to anything, but rather, is loosely coupled to any and all web
browsers.

&gt;

&gt; in the sense that this client requirement on the server (of

Client requests old URL.  Server responds 308 with new URL.  Client
updates bookmark, never requests obsolete URL again.  There is no
coupling here, by any definition of the term.

It's Representational State Transfer, you transfer the state of a 
resource through a representation of it. The entire thing is hinged on 
transferring representations of state via well defined data types, 
from/to URI accessible resources using standardized protocol elements. 
This is what makes REST loosely coupled, and suitable for internet/web 
scale usage.

&gt;&gt; The more ubiquitous the data type, the looser the
&gt;&gt; coupling. What's being discussed is the degree of coupling between
&gt;&gt; client and server, not server and Web Developer. It gets very confusing

Can be summed up as "cool URIs don't change".

&gt; Ideally a server API has only one entry point URI, but for practical

&gt; URI:s. Actually this set of URI:s could just as well be considered a
&gt; set of different server API:s! These URI:s can be differentiated
&gt; simply by virtue of them being published as "official" entry URI:s.

Is the concept of a "server API" useful? I mean REST is an information 
hiding protocol, for any potential URI you can interact with, you have 
no idea if there are one or ten-thousand servers behind it, it's of no 
concern. You can build a RESTful service over thousands of different 
URIs, with different domain parts, on different machines around the 
world using different languages, operating systems, ones you control and 
ones you don't, and each resource itself be a computation over hundreds 
of other disparate data sources, etc. Each part of the service, each 
resource, can be independently reused in unexpected ways.

What's the point of having a massively scalable loosely coupled 
architectural style and supporting protocols + media types, if you're 
going to centralize and tightly couple everything, and require clients 
to have prior knowledge which can only be gained out of band?

If a URI is GETable, then it would make sense and be good practise to 
ensure it's GETable more than once, and on the rare occasions where 
there's a requirement for it to expire, provide a half decent 
explanation in response to any request to indicate what's happened, 
either as MRD, HRD, or both along with appropriate status codes. Seems 
like common sense?

I am not arguing against that this is good behaviour on the part of

a server to maintain (for ever) all URI:s that have been exposed to
clients.

We don't seem to have the same understanding of the terms involved or
problem, so I'm leaving the discussion for now.

Looks good and most useful, is it worth mentioning anywhere that this 
inverse relations(describes being the inverse of describedby) is now 
needed due to @rev falling out of fashion? It may help explain why 
describes wasn't defined by powder in the first instance.

Best and KUTGW,

honestly, i think such a comment would probably confuse more people than

Interesting question.

I am not sure POST goes with Conditional update. Need to check the spec.

Meanwhile - can you use PATCH?

You'd need to roll your own little patch media type. Would be interesting if you shared your use case.


PATCH /contract/42
If-Match: "3"
Content-Type: application/contract-update

&lt;contract-update&gt;
  &lt;set-status&gt;platinum&lt;/set-status&gt;
&lt;/contract-update&gt;

200 Ok
ETag: "4"
Content-Type: application/contract

&lt;contract&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;Bert&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;status&gt;platinum&lt;/status&gt;
&lt;/contract&gt;

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] partial updates to same url?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>when i want to support partial updates on an existing resource and only
have POST at my disposal (i.e. brower-based clients) is usually do the
following:

- create an HTML.FORM (or other equiv in the preferred media type) that
contains
  + etag of existing resource
  + fields to update (usually pre-populated w/ existing data)
  + an URL that is unique for that resource (/blog-posts/{id};partial,
/partial-updates/{globally-unique-id}, etc.)

the etag serves to prevent:
- distributed update problem
- multi-post by the same client

the URL helps
- not confuse the original URL (/blog-posts/{id}) with the partial update
- allows me to get away with *not* using a PATCH-style message format
(again, helpful for browser-based cases)
- BTW - in one case i used the etag in the POST URL
(/blog-posts/{id};{etag}) but that was kinda messy due to encoding details

of course this means the caches are out-of-date, but using the ETag limits
that problem to only caches that don't honor the ETag.

Hope this gives you some ideas.

What confusion are you trying to avoid? Do you mean where the original would normally support POST (append) and PATCH? Typically I've seen "overloaded POST" include a hidden input with, say _method=PATCH to disambiguate. 

&gt; of course this means the caches are out-of-date, but using the ETag limits that problem to only caches that don't honor the ETag.

A POST to the same URL doesn't have that problem. If we are logically PATCHing the root URL I prefer to direct the POST there, precisely for the visibility it affords caches. Even with Etags, if you have an actual max-age or Expires, you won't see an update until the entry goes stale if it's not invalidated*. Technically correct; max-age=60 means you can treat that response as the correct one for the next 60 seconds. But if you miss the opportunity to invalidate a client/browser cache, the user will likely be surprised by this "correct" behavior.

* or until the client tries a conditional update with the stale Etag and gets a 412, for example.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Maintaining obsolete URIs is not an example of "coupling" as applies to
&gt; &gt;&gt; REST. REST isn't "decoupled" but rather, "loosely coupled" around
&gt; &gt;&gt; standardized data types. The more obscure the data type, the tighter
&gt; &gt;&gt; the coupling. The more ubiquitous the data type, the looser the
&gt; &gt;&gt; coupling. What's being discussed is the degree of coupling between
&gt; &gt;&gt; client and server, not server and Web Developer. It gets very confusing
&gt; &gt;&gt; when participants in a discussion introduce their own definitions of
&gt; &gt;&gt; terms.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; An analogy may be your signs in the windows of your local shops, if one 
&gt; &gt; of them moves to a new premise, they could say nothing, or they could 
&gt; &gt; say "we've moved here" (30x). If they've got a new shop front on the 
&gt; &gt; other side, again they could post a sign to say "the doors now here". If 
&gt; &gt; they're closed they could say "closed" or "closed, were open again at 
&gt; &gt; 09:00". Regardless of the situation, if the place is closed, or gone, 
&gt; &gt; then leaving a note to provide some information will always help the 
&gt; &gt; client, and can be seen as good practise. You don't have to do it, but 
&gt; &gt; it sure makes sense to do it. Network protocol are just the same.

Related to the discussion in general:

&gt; Point being, that it's nothing to do with coupling, it's just etiquette, 
&gt; common sense, and good practise.

Subject:Intermediaries and state<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi y'all-

REST defines the component types user agent, intermediary (proxy and gateway) and origin server.

User agents hold application state

Origin servers hold any state that is not application state

Do intermediaries hold state? Is it possible that they do? Or is that ruled out by definition? Would an origin server turn partially into an origin server once it did hold state?

Can cached responses be considered 'state' from a software architectural style theory point of view?

Spec gives an example of PUT as conditional update but doesn't rule out

What is the reality of browser PATCH support today? Regardless our API has
always used POST so a bit loath to change conventions now.

 Not dissimilar to your example.

We have a resource which is basically a long list of statuses representing
domains enabled for a service. Since the selection process is usually a
one-off bulk selection, rather than put this lengthy list back and check
for changes, we just POST back the changed statuses using the ETag to make
sure the transitions are valid.

Subject:Don't specific media types introduce coupling?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

It’s an often-discussed topic that continues to puzzle me:
self-descriptiveness is encouraged to reduce coupling, but how specific can we describe without introducing coupling?
And specifically: to what extent could “self-describing” formats such as RDF help out here?

Let me borrow the Maze+XML example used in a previous discussion [1].
So the problem is: a server exposes a maze, a client needs to be able to navigate through it.
Basically, there are two options:
1) Use a generic format (such as JSON) and explain separately what the different fields mean.
2) Use a specific format (such as Maze+XML); no need to explain, everything is in the media type.

At first, it seems like the second solution minimizes the amount of out-of-band information, as solution 1 involves a separate explanation document (which might or might not be expressed in a machine-processable way). But if you think about it, solution 2 has the exact same amount of out-of-band information, only this time it has moved to the interpretation of the media type’s specification. In both cases, the client needs to be adapted specifically to interact with the media type. And how decoupled is it when client and server are constrained to a specific message format?

Things _could_ be different with a self-describing format, as this might overcome the need for specific media types. So here’s another situation:
3) Use a self-describing format (such as RDF); no need to explain, and the client can work this out by itself.
(Although I’m being slightly overoptimistic about RDF now.) The idea would be that the client can interpret the representation as being a maze, and continue to use it that way.

My basic question is thus: do specific media types really reduce coupling, and if not, what does?

Best,

Ruben

No. Self descriptiveness is there to allow intermediaries to do something with the request (e.g. caching, retry until response retrieved for idempotent methods) as opposed to merely passing it on (they are not at the transport level but at the transfer level (application level)).

&gt; but how specific can we describe without introducing coupling?

Contracts do exist in REST, the difference to RPC is that they are centrally owned (as opposed to server owned). Both, client and server couple to these central contracts but not to *each other*.

&gt; And specifically: to what extent could “self-describing” formats such as RDF help out here?

RDF-aware clients are just that - RDF aware. There is no magic in REST that suddenly allows clients to come up with implementation logic that has not been baked into them when they where coded. REST doesn't make the problems of decentralized systems (where communication between client owner and server owner is impossible or too costly) go away.

Quite the opposite: REST makes them explicit (e.g. SOA(P) hides them while implying to solve them), forces you to deal with them but also provides you with a 'conceptual framework' to deal with them in a controlled way. (Well, actually REST allows you to design an architecture that allows you to deal with them in a controlled way. HTTP is such an architecture).

HTML and AtomPub are good example of such centrally owned contracts. While they seem rather generic, there is actually a lot of stuff that is highly specific (take client side image maps in HTML for example). Clients that implement support for them couple themselves to the contratc the specs describe.

Now, HTML and AtomPub are designed to realize use cases that turn to a human user often for making descisions in what action step to take next.

If you want to realize use cases where the human actor is much less involved (and the user agent does a lot more on its own) you need to come up with media types (and/or link relations) that provide the necessary hypermedia semantics to write such user agents.

If you do not do that (write specific media types) but instead use generic ones (application/xml, application/json) you absolutely, 100%, need some out of band coupling somewhere if you want your client to do more than 'parse as xml' or 'parse as json'. And you will, immediately, end up with a non RESTful architecture where out of band contract is owned and changed by the server.

This need not be bad, but it is likely to produce the same probles in the long run that to avoid made you look at REST in the first place.

Either way, understand the tradeoffs of what you are designing - this is probably the most valuable lesson that Roy has tought us (me anyway) with his work.

As for some discussion of the tradeoffs you might find[1] interesting.

&gt; 
&gt; Let me borrow the Maze+XML example used in a previous discussion [1].
&gt; So the problem is: a server exposes a maze, a client needs to be able to navigate through it.
&gt; Basically, there are two options:
&gt; 1) Use a generic format (such as JSON) and explain separately what the different fields mean.
&gt; 2) Use a specific format (such as Maze+XML); no need to explain, everything is in the media type.
&gt; 
&gt; At first, it seems like the second solution minimizes the amount of out-of-band information, as solution 1 involves a separate explanation document (which might or might not be expressed in a machine-processable way). But if you think about it, solution 2 has the exact same amount of out-of-band information, only this time it has moved to the interpretation of the media type’s specification. In both cases, the client needs to be adapted specifically to interact with the media type. And how decoupled is it when client and server are constrained to a specific message format?
&gt; 
&gt; Things _could_ be different with a self-describing format, as this might overcome the need for specific media types. So here’s another situation:
&gt; 3) Use a self-describing format (such as RDF); no need to explain, and the client can work this out by itself.
&gt; (Although I’m being slightly overoptimistic about RDF now.) The idea would be that the client can interpret the representation as being a maze, and continue to use it that way.
&gt; 
&gt; My basic question is thus: do specific media types really reduce coupling, and if not, what does?

The maze example was trivial enough to not need a custom media type was
really my point (and end-state is simply no hyperlinks)

<pre>Hi Jan,

Thanks for the very detailed answer, that clears up a lot of the questions I had concerning coupling.

&gt; If you do not do that (write specific media types) but instead use generic ones (application/xml, application/json) you absolutely, 100%, need some out of band coupling somewhere if you want your client to do more than 'parse as xml' or 'parse as json'. And you will, immediately, end up with a non RESTful architecture where out of band contract is owned and changed by the server.

I’m not sure about the latter.
I agree if this out-of-band coupling (say, a description document, maybe machine-processable) is static and has to be precompiled. However, if such a description document can be obtained and interpreted at runtime [1], I’d argue that a RESTful interaction is taking place.

Then you don't need to call it a "description document" since it's
just another resource with links that is part of your application.

Of course, this would just be another linked resource (maybe even rel=describedby).
But the peculiarity of this resource would be that it enables clients to understand how to act upon another document with a generic media type, thereby avoiding the need to use specific media types while keeping the benefits of specific semantics.

&gt;

You can convey your application's semantics via the documentation of
your link relations. If you're following the Web Linking spec then
your app specific link relations should be URIs. If you make those
link relation URIs ones you control then you can expose documentation
at each one describing the semantics of the target resource and the
possible transitions over the link - this documentation can be both
human readable (html) and/or machine readable (some horrible schema
thing or form or whatever).

Subject:How to identify existing resource in a POST(a) request<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

I'm currently wrangling with a problem about identification of existing resources within the representation of a POST request.

To make this more tangible, lets consider that:

(i) there are resources at the following URI's that represent person-like things

	example.com/persons/1
	example.com/persons/2
	graph.facebook.com/2

(ii) and that my user-agent has cached them, 
(iii) and that I am authoritative for example.com:

Let's also add that there is a collection at "example.com/friends" which with a GET request returns a list of (links to) persons that have been classified as friends.

The /friends collection resource accepts POST, and interprets the representation as 'someone to add to my friends' i.e. a reasonably standard implementation of POST(a) for a collection.

Option 1:  Use a domain specific identifier

If I consider only the local domain (ignoring the externals for a moment) then using an attribute such as 'id' (or similar) seems reasonable for identification of the resource.  For example, the representation indicates an 'id' of 2, then I could *infer* that the intent is to add "example.com/persons/2" as a friend.  The issues here are that either:

i) only a subset of resources must be POSTed to the /friends collection (i.e. person like things), or
ii) a non-overlapping identifier has to be used (i.e. nothing else in the domain can have an 'id' of 2.  

Whilst implementation of UUIDs (or similar) would work around the uniqueness of identifier point (ii), it cannot be guaranteed that only a subset of (person like) resources will be sent to the server (always the client's intent).

Further, when we introduce external domains, even the UUID solution is inadequate (i.e. is it an example.com identifier or a facebook.com identifier?) as the domain is not known.

So, I think this slightly clumsy derivation concludes with the answer, use the URI - it is after all the global identifier.

Note: whilst this appears obvious, compare with *all* the 'id' based solutions in the wild - I suspect that 'id' based solutions will remain limited to local domain solutions rather than embracing the distributed aspects of REST.

Option 2: Use the URI in the representation

The typical / established approach for representations to identify their resource is through a "self link".  This is variability encoded as a link with a "rel" of "self" (IANA link relation), or just as a property of a attribute e.g. link =&gt; uri... or self =&gt; uri...  Irrespective of the encoding, what we are mandating here is that the representation has a "self" identifier in it, and that identifier is a URI.

Option 3: Use the URI in the Request headers...

Mandating that such a self link is encoded in the representation seems somewhat onerous on media type designers, and ripe for disagreement.  I was therefore wondering if any standardised HTTP Request headers could help here?

The 'Referer' header appears to offer hope:

"The Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for the server’s benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained allows the client to specify, for the server’s benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained" [RFC2616]

However, I've not seen or heard about this header being used in this manner.  Does anybody know of any research in this space?

Any thoughts on Options 2 or 3?

Thanks in advance

Paul

<pre>Paul,

on the Web resources  are identified by URIs, so that leaves us with your
options 2 and 3. I don’t really see the problems you outline there but a
different one. What if a system assigns multiple URLs to access the same
resource but different representations thereof? For instance
example.com/persons/1.json and example.com/persons/1.xml? Both return
representations of the same resource and both would likely contain just
those URLs in the self-link. So the right link relation to use would be
canonical [1] and not self. That link can then either be embedded directly
embedded into the representations or served as an HTTP link header [2].
Using the referrer won't work as that's the page that a user agent visited
last which might has nothing to do with that resource it is POSTing.

Hope this helps,

<pre>Markus,

Thanks for the response.

With regard to your 'URI per representation' dilemma, this is (as you suggest) a separate problem.

From my perspective, by declaring '.../1.json' and '.../1.xml' two separate resources have been defined.  There is no *need* to define a URI per representation in this manner, as we have 'Content-Type' and 'Accept' headers to deal with that.  The resource is simply '.../1' (or whatever) and it *may* have multiple representations (one per media type).  Irrespective, if a system (designer) chooses to make two (or more) URIs available for the same resource, then they are obliged to manage the 'mapping' of multiple URIs back to the (canonical) resource.  Returning to your example the 'self link' for '.../1.json' should be to '.../1.json' - it's a server responsibility to understand that '.../1.json' maps to resource '1'.  This is not an interface, but an implementation concern.

My question is really regarding whether use of the 'Referer' header is a sensible way to identify the URI of the representation that initiated the request.  Additionally, whilst I note some security concerns in RFC 2616, I see no reference to 'Referer' being restricted to any "last page" notion.  Whilst the "referer as last-page" scenario may an artefact of some web usage patterns, I don't think HTTP constrains it in this way.

Best regards

Paul

I recommend you do not implement your server such that is has a dependency
on the Refer header when processing a request. Consider the possibility
that someone might bookmark a link and then start a new session w/ that
link (no refer). Also consider cases where the client application
(user-agent) does not provide a refer header.

Finally consider the case where someone discovers your use of refer in this
way and uses that as a way to craft intentionally invalid requests to run
against your server.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Paul,

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are certainly the best choice for 
identifiers on the Web.

It appears that you want to POST a representation of a person to 
/friends in order to have the person described by the representation 
added as a friend of the currently authenticated user.

If this is correct, then I'd encourage you to:

A) describe the action you want performed with a representation (friend 
request) and POST that instead.

B) refactor things such that either:

B1) the representation at example.com/persons/1 contains a list of that 
persons friends, a list which you update by POSTing annotations (friend 
requests) to, or update by PATCHing it, or by PUTting a new representation.

B2) create a resource example.com/persons/{local-identifier}/friends 
which is a list of for each person, and again POST, PATCH or PUT to 
update it.

In all honesty though, your best bet here is most likely to take a look 
at myprofile-project.org and speak to Andrei Sambra &lt;andrei@...&gt; as 
they've nailed exactly what you want to do. Identification of agents 
making request, and open profiles of them are provided by WebID and 
Linked Data. This really appear to be what you need for this scenario 
(and probably all scenario's you can think of).

As a side note, you can identify who is making a request by requiring 
auth* when the person makes it, or by using the From header in the 
request (although this is rather limited as it only takes identifiers of 
the form user@..., which then leads you down the road of needing 
WebFinger to lookup users).

Ultimately, the exact method on how you implement this depends on which 
mediatype(s) you end up using, at an abstract level it's just a simple 
three-tuple truth statement you want to send though 
"&lt;example.com/persons/1&gt; friend &lt;example.com/persons/2&gt;", via auth* you 
can find out whether it's '&lt;example.com/persons/1&gt;' updating their 
profile, or &lt;example.com/persons/2&gt; making a friend request.

Best,

Nathan

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently wrangling with a problem about identification of existing resources within the representation of a POST request.
&gt; 
&gt; To make this more tangible, lets consider that:
&gt; 
&gt; (i) there are resources at the following URI's that represent person-like things
&gt; 
&gt; 	example.com/persons/1
&gt; 	example.com/persons/2
&gt; 	graph.facebook.com/2
&gt; 
&gt; (ii) and that my user-agent has cached them, 
&gt; (iii) and that I am authoritative for example.com:
&gt; 
&gt; Let's also add that there is a collection at "example.com/friends" which with a GET request returns a list of (links to) persons that have been classified as friends.
&gt; 
&gt; The /friends collection resource accepts POST, and interprets the representation as 'someone to add to my friends' i.e. a reasonably standard implementation of POST(a) for a collection.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 1:  Use a domain specific identifier
&gt; 
&gt; If I consider only the local domain (ignoring the externals for a moment) then using an attribute such as 'id' (or similar) seems reasonable for identification of the resource.  For example, the representation indicates an 'id' of 2, then I could *infer* that the intent is to add "example.com/persons/2" as a friend.  The issues here are that either:
&gt; 
&gt; i) only a subset of resources must be POSTed to the /friends collection (i.e. person like things), or
&gt; ii) a non-overlapping identifier has to be used (i.e. nothing else in the domain can have an 'id' of 2.  
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst implementation of UUIDs (or similar) would work around the uniqueness of identifier point (ii), it cannot be guaranteed that only a subset of (person like) resources will be sent to the server (always the client's intent).
&gt; 
&gt; Further, when we introduce external domains, even the UUID solution is inadequate (i.e. is it an example.com identifier or a facebook.com identifier?) as the domain is not known.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I think this slightly clumsy derivation concludes with the answer, use the URI - it is after all the global identifier.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: whilst this appears obvious, compare with *all* the 'id' based solutions in the wild - I suspect that 'id' based solutions will remain limited to local domain solutions rather than embracing the distributed aspects of REST.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 2: Use the URI in the representation
&gt; 
&gt; The typical / established approach for representations to identify their resource is through a "self link".  This is variability encoded as a link with a "rel" of "self" (IANA link relation), or just as a property of a attribute e.g. link =&gt; uri... or self =&gt; uri...  Irrespective of the encoding, what we are mandating here is that the representation has a "self" identifier in it, and that identifier is a URI.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 3: Use the URI in the Request headers...
&gt; 
&gt; Mandating that such a self link is encoded in the representation seems somewhat onerous on media type designers, and ripe for disagreement.  I was therefore wondering if any standardised HTTP Request headers could help here?
&gt; 
&gt; The 'Referer' header appears to offer hope:
&gt; 
&gt; "The Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for the serverï¿½s benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained allows the client to specify, for the serverï¿½s benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained" [RFC2616]
&gt; 
&gt; However, I've not seen or heard about this header being used in this manner.  Does anybody know of any research in this space?
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on Options 2 or 3?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt; 
&gt; Paul

<pre>Mike,

Hi - thanks for responding.

In this instance I'm not sure I fully agree...

When following a bookmark, the default goal is a GET.  This is reasonable in that a bookmark contains the URI, but lacks semantic information (the "rel") with which to understand anything more.  The default behaviour of a user-agent is therefore "I'll GET the resource and go from there".  In a hyperlink context, as we understand, the goal (as educated by the "rel") can be and generally is more complex.

My point here is not that the "Referer" is a general solution that I could / should be dependent on in all scenarios, but that it provides the origin server more information (in a standardised way) about the context in which a hypermedia link has been followed - enriching the request semantics if you will.  In some cases this would be useful, and perhaps preferable to the requirement for a "self" link in the representation.

With regards to the user-agent issue -&gt; fix user-agent!

With regards to the security concern I don't really see how *using* the Referer header instead of a "self" link provides any more exposure (i.e. it is just an encoding choice).  Anybody can form a malicious request (malicious "self" link) - it is still an origin server responsibility to "do the right thing".

Best regards

Paul

&gt; My question is really regarding whether use of the 'Referer' header is a sensible way to identify the URI of the representation that initiated the request.  Additionally, whilst I note some security concerns in RFC 2616, I see no reference to 'Referer' being restricted to any "last page" notion.  Whilst the "referer as last-page" scenario may an artefact of some web usage patterns, I don't think HTTP constrains it in this way.
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I recommend you do not implement your server such that is has a dependency on the Refer header when processing a request. Consider the possibility that someone might bookmark a link and then start a new session w/ that link (no refer). Also consider cases where the client application (user-agent) does not provide a refer header.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally consider the case where someone discovers your use of refer in this way and uses that as a way to craft intentionally invalid requests to run against your server.

So you are saying that every representation of a person has to contain a

graph.facebook.com/2 must somewhere contain a link to example.com/friends?
Otherwise, how did that URI "initiate the request"?

I think HTTP (bis) is quite clear on this:

The "Referer" [sic] header field allows the client to specify the URI
of the resource from which the target URI was obtained (the
"referrer", although the header field is misspelled.).

So I would say it's a bad design decision to use the referer header for the
scenario you are outlining.

&gt;
&gt; on the Web resources are identified by URIs, so that leaves us with your
&gt; options 2 and 3. I don’t really see the problems you outline there but a
&gt; different one. What if a system assigns multiple URLs to access the same
&gt; resource but different representations thereof? For instance
&gt; example.com/persons/1.json and example.com/persons/1.xml? Both return
&gt; representations of the same resource and both would likely contain just
&gt; those URLs in the self-link. So the right link relation to use would be
&gt; canonical [1] and not self.
&gt;

Agree. You might want to use URNs for these canonical URIs too.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Markus,

Your observation of the "demands of hypermedia" is exactly the point.  

1) Why would / should Facebook provide a link to a specific service?  
2) Without such a link, where should the "hypermedia following" client go?
3) Even if they (Facebook) desired to provide such a link, would this be possible? (presumably they would need some understanding of the resource state within the example.com domain)

I think what is becoming more clear (through this discussion) is that hypermedia links have to be provided by an authoritative source (in this case example.com).  How non-authoritative resources can interact in the media-type across "agency boundaries" is more complex, and needs more research (certainly be me, perhaps it's obvious to others).

Back to the 'Referer' question, I was investigating this partly to see if a standard HTTP header could be used instead of hyperlinks in some circumstances.  Digging back through the archives, I've found some commentary from Phill Hallam-Baker (proposer of the 'Referer' header) here, where he articulates the header's "intended purpose of making links bidirectional".  This intended purpose seems somewhat aligned, but I'm guessing that years of usage for tracking purposes has devalued the semantic a little (I'll think I'll get in touch with Phill directly on this).

So, I think that I am concluding that usage of the 'Referer' header for my purpose is incorrect, but it's on the basis of "common-usage" rather than conflict with the standard [RFC2616].

Thanks

Paul

<pre>Nathan,

Firstly, thanks for the response.

I've taken a look at the myprofile-project.org and it looks promising.  From what I can deduce it's based on the FOAF work, which in turn is built on RDF.  As we're currently a bit of a JSON shop, it's somewhat tricky to directly translate this, but I'll pick this up with Andrei directly.

I think your Option A is the most palatable, as frankly instead of a "friend-request" representation, this can just be a "friend" representation which then links to a person.  This nicely separates the relationship semantic from the entity semantic, and thus (as with all 'resource-parititioning") the cache concerns can be independently handled / optimised.

I'm still somewhat sceptical of the use of the "self link" as in most cases (all cases for my current usage) it's just a restatement of the Request-URI (or redirection thereof), but, the separate representation simplifies the problem.  Perhaps I had over-collapsed the representation design and just needed to back-away a little.

Anyway, thanks for the thinking.

It does have it's uses, especially rel="canonical" for several 
similar/identical resources.

However, it's also useful to consider the messages, and look to those. 
After all you can model the state of a resource within a protocol as a 
function of all the messages to date - or -  the current state (Sn) as a 
function of a message M and a previous state (Sn-1), and time T. That is 
to say, it's the messages which change the state of a resource. So any 
resource which changes it's state by way of messages, would do well to 
consider those messages, especially the effective-request-URI for the 
resource currently being interacted with / requested. I know HTTP is 
often "black-boxed" by components to hide the implementation details 
(especially request lines and headers), but they're pretty vital to 
building RESTful services!

Subject:Link types and profiles<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>This may be a remedial question but:

Is or isn't it legitimate to add link types (i.e. values for rel
attributes) in document profiles?

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links : "Authors may wish to
define additional link types not described in this specification. If they
do so, they should use a profile to cite the conventions used to define the
link types. Please see the profile attribute of the HEAD element for more
details."

but

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#profiles : "The profile
attribute of the HEAD specifies the location of a meta data profile." and
goes on to strongly imply that the profile describes how to interpret META
tag data, but is otherwise pretty quiet about how to use it.

There's XMDP, of course, which tries to address link type/meta by
suggesting that you define explicit rel properties - but there's sort of a
semantic leap between &lt;meta name="&lt;property&gt;" value="&lt;value&gt;"&gt; and &lt;link
rel=&lt;value&gt;&gt;

If it is legit, why not legit to add acceptable values for any tag
attribute (without describing *which* tags it's legit on)?

Subject:A browsable JSON API (and the graphical browser)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello group,

Here's the documentation, source, and (most importantly) live demo of the browser:
https://bitbucket.org/ratfactor/hm-json-browser/


After reading Ruby and Richardson's "RESTful Web Services", my mind was absolutely swimming with the heady possibilities of an XHTML-based API that would be completely browsable in a normal web browser.  However, because of troubled web browser support and my personal preference for JSON over XML formats, I started to think about JSON-based alternatives.

Thankfully, JavaScript XHR requests allow the full range of HTTP methods.  So creating a JavaScript browser was certainly possible.  Now all that remained was adding an ultra-simple microformat to JSON that the JavaScript browser would understand.

After some evenings and weekends, I completed the hm-json (hypermedia JSON) Browser.  I've put it under the permissive MIT license so that anyone can use it and modify it for their own project.  

I particularly value any insights or comments from this group because I *think* this is a neat application of the REST concept, but I'm a little afraid to say so without more feedback from "serious REST people".


How it works:

The hm-json Browser uses the OPTIONS HTTP method to request the hypermedia representation of a resource at a URI.  It parses the server's response and displays it in a simple graphical menu containing the document's title, description, and list of related links.  The links, in turn, may describe other methods available on *that* resource, or other related resources altogether such as parent or child resources.

The links are composed of a URI, a rel(ated) property, the HTTP method supported (such as GET, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT), and also a title and description to display to a human user.  The browser turns these into clickable menu items which make the appropriate request to the server.  Some links, such as PUT or POST (or templated URIs) will need some additional input, so the browser presents input fields for these as needed.

As you can see, the whole thing is very simple.  But with just these few properties, the hm-json Browser allows anyone to start at a single entry URI anywhere in the API and browse their way through the rest of the API, discovering all of the resources and methods available on the server (as permissions may dictate).  Thus, the API is completely self-documenting and requires absolutely no programming to use.


Note:

This isn't just an aimless experiment.  The whole reason I started to seriously explore REST is because I'm designing the API for a commercial web application (which is completed and live but currently has no client-facing API).  I'm not embarrassed to admit that I was drawn to the REST style because of the "pretty URLs".  But as I learned more, the thing that really excited me about REST was the hypermedia element.  And I was really surprised to find so few actual working examples of that out in the wild.  

I hate buzzwords and I am very aware that REST is often used as one.  Therefore, when our commercial product uses this browser to expose the API to client developers, I want it to be a "good example" of REST, not yet another bad one.


Thanks in advance for any feedback you can give me.  Criticism welcome!

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Link types and profiles<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>here are some things that might help you on the subject of Link Relation 
Types, HTML, etc.

- HTML's guidance on the use of Link Relation Types is, IMO, vague.
- HTML is not the only representation format where Link Relation Types can 
be used (re Atom, HAL, Collection+JSON, etc.)
- the Web linking spec is a good source of recommended best practice on 
defining Link Relation Type values[1]
- a much stronger and clearer guidance on HTML's use of "profile" Link 
Relation Type stalled in 2010[2]
- the Microformat team (led by Tantek Celik of XMDP fame) has picked up the 
"profile" spec[3]
- I led an experiment at RESTFest 2011 on using profiles w/ HTML that had 
pretty good results[4]

finally, I think there is a good deal of promise in the notion of defining 
application-level semantics independent of a generic media type (HTML, HAL, 
etc.) and am continuing to work on this.  My approach is to continue to use 
the "profile" Link Relation Type value as a way to apply these semantics to 
a representation in a way very much in line w/ the way HTML4 uses "profile" 
and via a Link Header compatible w/ RFC5988.

Hope this helps.

&gt; here are some things that might help you on the subject of Link Relation
&gt; Types, HTML, etc.
&gt;
&gt; - HTML's guidance on the use of Link Relation Types is, IMO, vague.
&gt; - HTML is not the only representation format where Link Relation Types can
&gt; be used (re Atom, HAL, Collection+JSON, etc.)
&gt; - the Web linking spec is a good source of recommended best practice on
&gt; defining Link Relation Type values[1]
&gt; - a much stronger and clearer guidance on HTML's use of "profile" Link
&gt; Relation Type stalled in 2010[2]
&gt; - the Microformat team (led by Tantek Celik of XMDP fame) has picked up
&gt; the "profile" spec[3]
&gt; - I led an experiment at RESTFest 2011 on using profiles w/ HTML that had
&gt; pretty good results[4]
&gt;
&gt; finally, I think there is a good deal of promise in the notion of defining
&gt; application-level semantics independent of a generic media type (HTML, HAL,
&gt; etc.) and am continuing to work on this.  My approach is to continue to use
&gt; the "profile" Link Relation Type value as a way to apply these semantics to
&gt; a representation in a way very much in line w/ the way HTML4 uses "profile"
&gt; and via a Link Header compatible w/ RFC5988.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi folks

I recently delivered a talk on building hypermedia systems with ASP.NET Web
API. It is online here: http://vimeo.com/53261707. The talk is in two main
parts with the first focusing on the what and why of Hypermedia and the
second on approaches.

Feedback welcome.

Subject:Feedback regarding H-Factor<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Mark Baker posted a comment about my H-Factors[0] in the LDP-Public list[1]
and, via a private convo, suggested I bring that topic here for further
discussion.

I'm copying the bulk of his comments here to start:

I agree in general, but have reservations about the use of H Factor,
both as a method of evaluation, but more importantly, as a tool for
motivating a solution. Consider that the difference between idempotent
and non-idempotent methods doesn't matter at all from a hypermedia
POV, but what does matter is whether the state transition can occur in
the absence of additional information. This makes "LI" meaningless,
along with its distinction from "LN". Also, "CM" as a factor seems to
derive solely from HTML's unification of GET and POST forms, and
appears to extrapolate from that, that it's desirable to have the
server prescribe the method used by the client; IMO, that's the
opposite of what you want as the client is solely responsible for the
meaning of the messages that it sends.

My initial response follows:

Consider that the difference between idempotent
and non-idempotent methods doesn't matter at all from a hypermedia
POV,

In the work I do (creating clients that can parse, recognize, and activate
hypermedia controls within a response), awareness of whether a control
represents a safe/unsafe and idempotent/non-idempotent action is important;
esp. when attempting a recover from cases where errors occur or no response
is received after activation. Can you expand a bit on why you think the
diff between idempotent and non-idempotent does not matter?

"CM" as a factor seems to
derive solely from HTML's unification of GET and POST forms, and
appears to extrapolate from that, that it's desirable to have the
server prescribe the method used by the client

The ability to designate a protocol method within a hypermedia control
appears in HTML[2], VoiceXML[3], and some other designs I've seen that are
not yet registered (Siren[4] comes to mind). I suspect this is true for
other designs I have not yet encountered.

My work on the Factors is meant to identify and catalog patterns for
enabling hypermedia in use on the WWW. It is not meant to confer
"desirability" upon any of the items I find.


that's the
opposite of what you want as the client is solely responsible for the
meaning of the messages that it sends.

I'm not sure what you mean here. "[T]he opposite of what you want.." is
addressed to whom? (e.g. "you"==??). "[T]he client is solely responsible
for the meaning..." I am not ascribing meaning or responsibility in
H-Factors.

Finally, if anyone thinks I have failed to identify existing hypermedia
patterns (e.g. they are not found in these H-Factors) and/or thinks I have
included pattern that do not actually exist, I'd like to hear about it.
 The purpose in this work is to create useful names for existing elements
to foster more understanding around how [hypermedia|hypertext] messages are
designed and how they are used. Any and all feedback is welcome.

Thanks.

<pre>Jumping in here...

the biggest challenge (some would say drawback) to using my Collection+JSON
media type is that it was specifically designed to "break the back" of
object-style serializers in code libraries&lt;g&gt;.

I find that facing the notion of switching communications between machines
from object-oriented to state-oriented can be enlightening, even if it
turns out that's not what you decide to do for your project.

I think HAL does a very good job of providing hypermedia affordances while
still supporting object-style message passing.  Be sure to check that one
out, too. It's also possible Siren would be a good fit, but I've not built
much w/ that one yet.

Cheers.

Subject:Looking for advice with resources and link relations<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hey all,

I'm looking for some ideas on how to model the resources and link relations
for a Dynamic Distributed Service Locator where services register in a
directory with information like:

- Service Name
- Service Version (multiple versions of the service can exist in the
directory)
- Data Center Location
- Service Endpoint address
- Service Quality (multiple instances of the service may exist, some on
better hardware than others)

A service will register itself with the directory but also query it for
dependencies. ServiceA may require to locate ServiceB using version 2.0 but
here's where I start to get confused how I might model this, it may also
decide it prefers data center locality as a primary preference and service
quality as a secondary preference.

Administration UI's may also do broader queries to show a dashboard.

My first thoughts was something like this when ServiceA queries for
ServiceB.

/services/ServiceB/2.0?prefer=datacenter,quality

This would list all versions of ServiceB.
/services/ServiceB

Would a good idea then be to have something like this for querying what
services exist in a data center?
/DataCenterA

And maybe to get a specific version of an instance from a data center.
/DataCenterA/ServiceB/2.0

With the results returning multiple listings, I would use links so that the
client can choose the right one to use, and if its unavailable it could
fallback using another link.

Any feedback is appreciated.

depends on how interactions are designed around it. just saying that "a

What the quote is trying to say is, I guess, that designing interactions in the spirit of RPC (here: InvoceService.add(invoice)) is not RESTful.

'Correct' would be sth like

POST /invoices

Content-type: application/foo.invoice

&lt;invoice&gt; ... &lt;/invoice&gt;

You do not need an 'add' semantic.


As for the URI string per se: that is opaque and meaningless (as Erik and Steve already noted).

Is there anyone with experiences with implementing API Keys in their apis?

Putting the APIKey in the URI is obviously a bad idea as that leaks to
every cache and intermediary. Including Apache logs.

So it must be a new header field.

The problem with APIKeys as such is that they are spoofable, unless they
are crypographically protected somehow, so my question is:

What do you do in your api?

The WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers exist for this very
purpose. In fact, RFC 2617 is designed to be extensible.

&gt; crypographically protected somehow, so my question is:
&gt;

HTTP auth headers. There's really no need for anything else except maybe
in cases where it's not possible to use HTTP auth (such as embedding a
fragment of JavaScript in a page, such as with Google Analytics, in
which case you're not going to care much about spoofability anyway). For
all other cases, using the existing HTTP auth headers is the right way
to go because you *are* performing a form of auth with an API key.

&gt; ps:
&gt; I am thinking about writing up an internet draft for a new Api-Key header
&gt; field.

You'd be better off proposing an alternative HTTP auth method, if
anything, where the client sends something like this (assuming the API
key is a UUID):

    Authorization: Key b67570be-3a22-11e2-8ca6-0015c55d83ee

Of course, that assumes a fixed key. If you wanted something more secure
and less liable to be spoofed, you'd end up with something similar to
Digest auth, so you might want to consider just using that unless you
can come up with something provably superior. Here's an example of an
alternative auth method:

This isn't the case, otherwise the likes of OAuth (which I mention

&gt; Using Authorization was considered, but we need to use this for user

&gt;

I think you might be missing the greater point I was trying to make,
which were that an existing mechanism already exist (RFC 2617):

&gt;     The WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers exist for this very
&gt;     purpose. In fact, RFC 2617 is designed to be extensible.

In fact, is this very extensibility that OAuth is built upon. OAuth
might not be ideal for your particular purpose, but RFC 2617 still
exists to build upon to quite possibly do what you want.

It's possible to build an RFC 2617 auth method that could potentially
bundle multiple challenges in a single aggregate challenge. Including
multiple 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Authorization' headers is another
matter, however.

Without knowing more about how your system's access management
requirements, it's hard to speculate further. I think it would be more
valuable to propose an auth method built on top of RFC 2617 to support
your requirements rather than a whole new header.

If you are looking for something along the lines of OAuth Client identifiers, you should take a look at OAuth 1 and 2 and the associated discussions.

Looking at Amazon IAM, as already suggested, is also good:

Personally, I am most excited about OZ, because Eran's OAuth 2 criticism looks very valid when you dig into it.

&gt; 
&gt; Putting the APIKey in the URI is obviously a bad idea as that leaks to every cache and intermediary. Including Apache logs.
&gt; 
&gt; So it must be a new header field. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with APIKeys as such is that they are spoofable, unless they are crypographically protected somehow, so my question is:
&gt; 
&gt; What do you do in your api?
&gt;

&gt; ps:
&gt; I am thinking about writing up an internet draft for a new Api-Key header field.

And having a POST request to that link should make sense.

Of course if trying to have a web interface you could have a GET http://www.mysite.com/invoices/edit page.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Thanks for your answers, it's pretty much what I had in mind.

I want to discuss a second example:

a)
POST /orders/1/cancel

vs.

b)
PATCH /orders/1

canceled=true


Does REST say anything in favor or against these two designs?

Personally, I would never do 'b' because it's simply hard to implement
with the tools I use. Also, isn't it a case of tunneling? 'Cancel' is
an action that does more than simply update a resource.

REST says "Do 'b', never 'a'." Sorry!
The simple rule is URIs are for nouns, HTTP methods are for verbs.

You could get away with this though:

POST /orders/1
cancelled=true

Originally, POST was intended to mean "post a reply" the same as it's NNTP namesake/predecessor. Now, though, the authors of HTTP concede that it's modern meaning is "Hey, server, use these data (request body) to perform some action to this resource (uri)"

As such, by POSTing to /orders/1 you are at least getting the resource part of the API right, even if you are lacking the semantics of a PATCH request.

&gt; Personally, I would never do 'b' because it's simply hard to implement
&gt; with the tools I use. Also, isn't it a case of tunneling? 'Cancel' is
&gt; an action that does more than simply update a resource.


I wouldn't call it tunnelling, tunnelling would be something like:

POST /orders/1

_method_override="DELETE"    // could also be custom HTTP header

If the "cancel" action is just updating a resource state, rather then, say, DELETEing the resource, then you could even do something like:

PUT /orders/1/cancelled
true

(again, use POST if you can't PUT)

and correspondingly:

GET /orders/1/cancelled

=&gt; "true"

GET /orders/2/cancelled

=&gt; "false"

(or 1/0, yes/no, … however you wish to represent it)


For reference, stackoverflow.com is a good place to go with these sorts of questions. Many have already been asked in various forms, you'll find the answers already provided.

Yes, right.

If it suits your use cases, consider:

DELETE /orders/1

Which might well result in the order being moved to a cancled-orders collection. IOW, it need not be erased entirely.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful order-status API (was: URI design, part 2)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>+1 to the other answers you've gotten.  Except...

REST is about optimizing the hell out of GET.  The hypertext containing
the PUT control is one place to GET the order status.  But, why cache-
expire the entire record when only one string is changed, multiple times
after the order is placed and becomes static?  A RESTful order-status
API should separate the dynamic aspects of order processing from the
static, as sub-resources, and manipulate *those* to alter a dynamic
representation of the static order.  This becomes especially efficient
when, say, a CC is rejected and the customer needs to enter another one.

Consider PUT /orders/1/status with strings like placed, processing,
pending, and the tracking # from the shipper -- I'd even consider
application/xml and application/json acceptable media types for a
snippet like this, of course not for the hypertext control defining the
PUT.  I'd never PUT 'canceled', I'd use DELETE as Jan described, which
would trigger a reshelving-fee transaction, with /status returning
reshelving on 200 OK, before /orders/1* return 410 Gone, indicating the
transaction has been fully reversed including by the inventory system.

Using code-on-demand to fill in the current status on the PUT control
exposes a status API which may be utilized many different ways (push,
poll, etc.), allowing for serendipitous re-use.  The downside of being
an additional round-trip is mitigated by using compression such that the
/status 200 OK response fits in one IP packet.  Note that XForms may be
used to make this code declarative, avoiding the optional constraint.

This thread isn't about URI design at all, in fact it's irrelevant to
this discussion about hypertext-driven application state, as is method
selection. Also RESTful: /CRMapp?order=1&amp;query=status on GET, and
/CRMapp?order=1&amp;status=canceled on POST using application/x-www-form-
urlencoded, if we assume the hypertext constraint is met, which is what
this thread is really about.

Then we can discuss the pros and cons of various media types which can
implement a RESTful status API, regardless of how the shopping cart is
implemented.  If you're working with making a legacy system more
RESTful over time, you may want HTML 4, JS and POST.  If this is
greenfield, you may consider XForms w/ PUT and DELETE.  Or, use HTML 5
if this is a Web system, not sure where it is regarding PUT/DELETE, but
it really doesn't matter...

The key is the architectural consideration of using subresources for
dynamic elements like order status, allowing the order itself to become
sticky in the client-side cache, while also allowing manipulation of
that resource to occur in one-IP-packet round-trips.  Optimizing
PUT/POST/PATCH doesn't amount to much in the grand scheme of things,
what counts is optimizing GET by making static all those bytes which
make up the order being processed, and manipulating its subresources.

The hypertext interface doesn't even have to reflect the strings
in /status, it could be a graphical progress bar followed by e-mailing
the tracking number (instead of, or in addition to, displaying it).  Or,
the strings in /status 200 OK could be numerals, whose semantics are
conveyed by the PUT control or other hypertext conveying order status.

Always remember REST is an architectural style, not implementation
guidelines.  If you take one thing from it, it should be "optimize GET
to maximize caching."  Then, any implementation mistakes you make are
correctable down the line, instead of coming here and being told to go
back to the drawing board -- iow, if you've separated static from
dynamic as an architectural pattern, then we can make changes to URIs
and methods based on what media types are most appropriate for your
application, because that'll be bikeshedding if you get your resources
right.

I prefer developing REST systems in XForms, makes it easy to separate
static from dynamic in declarative code, to get a handle on what your
resources *are* and how they relate to one another.  I call this
hypertext-constraint-centric development.  The result is a hypertext API
which may then be implemented any way it needs to be, letting the
implementation requirements dictate the system's ultimate hypertext, URI
allocation scheme, and media types if (most likely) XForms isn't
appropriate.  I may hate my HTML 4 implementations' URIs and methods,
but the underlying systems are implicitly RESTful and thus easy to
upgrade over time, as new hypertext technology emerges and matures.

Pretty good answer, except for that...  Welcome to rest-discuss!  ;-)

Here, the archives are full of list regulars being told directly by the
likes of Roy and Mark dozens of times that we're wrong.  Gradually,
this group has become _the_ place to get schooled on REST as intended
by Fielding.  There, I don't see many answers from those who've put
their knowledge to the test, here.  What I do see are attempts to define
REST in terms of implementation rather than style, i.e. Wikipedia REST,
not Fielding REST.

So pick the place that best suits your needs -- there if you want
implementation, here if you want architecture; there is a difference,
which comes down to the proportion of answers from those who've been
"vetted" by Roy (and Mark, and others) over the years, and understand
REST as an architectural style as opposed to implementation guidelines.

Just my two cents.

&gt; 

Right, YMMV with compression, but the main point is that the bulk of
the order is static data and therefore may be made highly persistent in
the client cache (cache-control: private), _that_ is how both round
trips and the transfer of a significant amount of bytes may be avoided,
even without optionally compressing certain traffic into one IP packet.
Architecture vs. implementation.  That being said...

I don't understand why compression is bad for latency, though.  I cache
compressed data, and unzip it on the fly, so the expensive zip operation
is only done once by the server each time the resource is updated. Which
means the only user who experiences zip latency, is the user who updates
the resource -- but does another second (if that) get perceived by the
user on PUT/POST/PATCH operations, and is there any real benefit to
optimizing these operations when GET is only like a billion times more
common a request method?  I think not.

Are mobile clients still so underpowered that their zip/unzip latency
exceeds the transfer gains?  Especially if we're talking about
manipulating resources and updating representations using one single-
packet-each-way round trip, double especially if we're talking about
users who are, you know, *mobile*.  If the client is moving from one
access point to another, caching the bulk of the data on the client and
using single-packet messaging is guaranteed to avoid the huge latency
hit of changing IP address/routing while manipulating a resource, which
seems to me like a huge gain in user-perceived performance.

<pre>Technically, of course, I mean "high probability of being a single

payload compressed.  This also depends on protocol -- HTTP 2 will allow
larger payloads to be compressed to one packet by slimming down header
size compared to HTTP 1.1, for example.

Well, what are you expecting to GET from /cancel, or are you just using
that URL to invoke a procedure? If so, then there are a few places Roy's
thesis admonishes against it in Chapter 6 -- the rest of REST is about
positive, rather than negative, reinforcement of the identification of
resources constraint. Suggested reading: 6.5.2; 6.2.1, in particular:
"REST [defines] a resource to be the semantics of what the author
intends to identify."

Not the semantics of a method invocation.  What does /cancel identify?
Sounds to me like a method of tunneling DELETE through POST which
identifies nothing, iow a procedure endpoint, which is characteristic
of various styles but not of the REST style.  The hypertext constraint
only makes sense if your resources make sense, in that their URLs are
identifiers rather than endpoints.

Roy's thesis really must be considered in its entirety, to understand
the uniform interface constraint (of which identification of resources
is a sub-constraint).  Chapter 1 introduces the notion of applying
design-by-constraint to networked software architecture, as inspired
by Eames IIRC.  "A style is a named set of constraints on architectural
elements that induces the set of properties desired of the
architecture." (4.3)

Chapter 2 defines terminology associated with networked software
architecture, which is required for understanding Chapter 3, which lays
out a methodology for evaluating various styles and applies this to
several examples.  Most importantly, Chapter 3 identifies the
constraints associated with various styles, and describes the properties
they induce in a system (which may or may not be beneficial or
detrimental to the system you're designing; remember there is no best
architecture, only that which is best for your system).  Which is of
course required for understanding Chapter 4.

Chapter 4 considers the problems raised by the WWW, and suggests that
the architecture may be improved by applying design-by-constraint to it,
in order to address those problems.  First, by identifying the desirable
properties of the early Web, and the constraints responsible for them;
next, by extending that architecture by adding additional constraints,
resulting in a new hybrid style consisting of aspects of existing
styles. Of course, this is required for understanding Chapter 5.

"REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, WHEN APPLIED
AS A WHOLE, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality
of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary
components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and
encapsulate legacy systems." (4.4)

Which brings us to Chapter 5, and the short answer to your question:
"POSTing to /cancel violates the Identification of Resources constraint,
and is therefore unRESTful."  But I've found that just giving that
answer tends to upset folks who've only read Chapter 5, then they get
defensive about why can't they call their API RESTful, accusations of
pedantry follow, and threads devolve into general ugliness, heheh...

My point is, you'll have a much harder time trying to understand REST
by being told bluntly what is and isn't RESTful, than you will by
reading Roy's thesis in its entirety.  As computer science dissertations
go, Roy produced a functional work of art, much as an Eames chair isn't
just a piece of furniture.  Understanding what the constraints are, and
where they come from, is vital to understanding how they're applied to
the Web to derive REST, and why they must be implemented as a whole to
achieve REST.

Only then will it become apparent when they're being violated, as in
the example given of POSTing to an unGETtable /cancel URL.  That level
of understanding comes from the bottom up, not from the top down, IMO.
Knowing what is or isn't REST depends on understanding the pros and
cons of various architectural styles, because that's what constraints
are, and constraints must be understood before their application to the
Web as REST can be understood.

More importantly, understanding REST as a style makes one a better
architect, because sometimes it's advantageous to deviate from REST's
constraints.  Which is why I'm always on about how saying something
isn't REST is not a value judgment, just a fact.  Understanding Roy's
thesis allows you to identify the constraints you have applied, and
understand that as its own architectural style derived from REST, to
use as a guide to developing that system -- but also to understand
which desirable properties of REST you're forfeiting in the bargain.

Making informed decisions about which constraints to apply, is making
use of REST as a tool for long-term development.  It may not be
feasible to apply all the constraints initially, if REST is truly what
your system needs.  In which case your system design can account for
this, becoming more RESTful over time, instead of painting yourself
into a corner where the system needs re-architecting rather than
implementing another constraint as an extension.

&gt; 

This is why Roy's thesis is an invaluable tool, at least for me anyway
as I've been at this since '93 and had a front-row seat at the
transition from the old Web to HTTP 1.1 -- Roy's experience applying
his concepts to a system I was familiar with is included in his thesis,
which helped me to incrementally apply REST to my own work as I gained
understanding of it.  Now, I can confidently design systems today which
may be easily extended to be fully RESTful tomorrow.

So I really don't stress about the unRESTful aspects of my systems,
they're "by design" and will continue to work themselves out over time.
Which is exactly what you want from an architectural style, particularly
for the Web.  Successful websites tend to grow users over time, and it
ain't easy to chuck one system for another.  What's needed is a system
which uses progressively less resources per user, as usage increases.

(Just check out the shoddy uptime records of certain big boys on the
block to see how badly this desirable property is needed, and note that
they don't begin to implement REST.)

Using REST as a tool enables the development of such systems by allowing
the architect to chart a steady course, deciding which constraints (like
identification of resources) are crucial to get right from the get-go,
and which may be put off until they satisfy a cost-benefit analysis.

For example, most popular CMS software defaults to no-cache.  But this
doesn't really matter until you're starting to bump into the transfer
limits of your hosting plan, at which time you can implement caching,
after having some time to test the setup first. You can then fine-tune
your cache settings over time, and later integrate with a CDN.  This is
usually done ad-hoc, what I'm saying is that knowledge of REST can make
this go smoothly rather than being a comedy of errors (quite common).

If your system doesn't grow to need it, then you can probably do without
all the added development expense (plus complexity driving up long-term
maintenance costs) of implementing non-native caching on that CMS. REST
is your friend when it comes to planning for and managing these expenses
and complexities vis-a-vis your cashflow.  Budgeting for ho-hum websites
is easy; successful websites are another story entirely, where knowledge
of REST as a tool can be your competitive edge in funding growth from
cashflow instead of debt or outside capital while turning a profit --
instead of piling up red ink on wasteful infrastructure.

Yeah, I know.  That just isn't how things are done on the Web!  :-D

They're configurable, and while this may have been a problem in the
past, I don't believe it to be anything but an edge case, now.  URIs
are opaque and should be considered in their entirety as cache keys.
The best a developer can do, is design to REST -- my example certainly
doesn't violate any constraints -- and let the deployed architecture
catch up.

There's much FUD out there about query strings, particularly in REST
discussions, which amounts to unfounded myth.  I see no reason to avoid
query strings because they *might* be ignored by a small percentage of
caches, economy of scale still kicks in vs. no-cache.  So go ahead and
treat URIs as opaque when doing REST development, the downside is
more than compensated for by the upside, more so as time goes by.

&gt;

Exactly.  And we don't know what the author intends to identify just by
looking at the path /orders/1/cancel.

Just looking at the syntax of a single request (e.g. the method POST and/or
the path /orders/1/cancel) is not enough to determine if the system adheres
to any particular architectural style.

The author may well intend that /cancel identifies a resource, and allow
lots of interaction in it.  It might even have an HTML representation, with
a nice &lt;form method="post"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="CANCEL"&gt;&lt;/form&gt; in
it.

But this is still not enough to determine if a system adheres to the
constraints: For even though the server provides such hypermedia controls,
media types and does everything "by the book", it is still up to the
*client* to actually *use* these hypermedia controls.  In fact it is up to
the author of the agent itself.

If you write code in the client that hard wires a button called "cancel" to
the "POST /orders/1/cancel" HTTP request then the client isn't really
honouring the hypermedia controls laid out above.  If, however, it _soft
wires_ the same button _because_ of the hypermedia control above, then
you're doing it "more right" I would say.  The point is that the client
should be written in such a way that it uses _only_ the hypermedia controls
that it receives at run-time.

Roy's thesis really must be considered in its entirety, [...]
&gt;

+1 to such a degree that 1 &gt; 1.  The rest of the stuff you wrote was great.
 I just want to highlight the incorrectness of the question, as others said
earlier that REST doesn't say anything about if POST /foo is or isn't...
 For all we know /orders/1/cancel is a picture of a dog, or it could be a
SOAP endpoint for a nice game of Global Thermonuclear War.

The constraints of REST are too often thought / taught to deal with the
server side, but in my experience, it has much more to do with the client
side, how much knowledge the client has on things like:

- what URLs can it use? (it shouldn't know any; but bind to one at
run-time, preferably via a configuration parameter)
- when it knows one URL (e.g. "/orders/1"), can it add "/cancel" to it to
cancel it?  (no, unless it was told to add "/cancel" by a hypermedia
control)
- does it know the "type" of a resource, e.g. that /orders/1 is an Order
(this is a point of contention on the list; browsers don't know about books
or a bank account, but work fine nonetheless.)
- when it does know the type of the URL is an order, does it pull up a
pre-coded "order" UI (bad), or does it create a UI based on what it finds
in the response (good)

To clarify, /orders/1/cancel is used to modify a resource, using POST.
A GET request would result in a Method Not Allowed response.

This is also explained on Subbu's book, chapter 2.6 "When and How to
Use Controllers to Operate on Resources":

"Problem: You want to know how to tackle write operations that involve
modifying more than one resource atomically, or whose mapping to PUT
or DELETE is not obvious. Solution: Designate a controller resource
for each distinct operation. Let clients use the HTTP method POST to
submit a request to trigger the operation... If the outcome is the
modification of one or more existing resources, return response code
303 (See Other) with a Location with a URI that clients can use to
fetch a representation of those modifications."

&gt; Not the semantics of a method invocation.  What does /cancel identify?
&gt; Sounds to me like a method of tunneling DELETE through POST which

&gt; only makes sense if your resources make sense, in that their URLs are
&gt; identifiers rather than endpoints.

If I understand correctly, you are saying that if I need to affect a
resource then I should use the uniform interface on that resource URI,
and not another URI.

After reading that chapter again I'm not sure my example violates
anything, but I'd love to get more clarification from you. Is it the
use of a verb in the URI? or not using the URI of the resource I'm
trying to modify directly?

&gt; cons of various architectural styles, because that's what constraints
&gt; are, and constraints must be understood before their application to the
&gt; Web as REST can be understood.
&gt;
&gt; More importantly, understanding REST as a style makes one a better
&gt; architect, because sometimes it's advantageous to deviate from REST's
&gt; constraints.  Which is why I'm always on about how saying something
&gt; isn't REST is not a value judgment, just a fact.  Understanding Roy's
&gt; thesis allows you to identify the constraints you have applied, and
&gt; understand that as its own architectural style derived from REST, to
&gt; use as a guide to developing that system -- but also to understand
&gt; which desirable properties of REST you're forfeiting in the bargain.
&gt;
&gt; Making informed decisions about which constraints to apply, is making
&gt; use of REST as a tool for long-term development.  It may not be
&gt; feasible to apply all the constraints initially, if REST is truly what
&gt; your system needs.  In which case your system design can account for
&gt; this, becoming more RESTful over time, instead of painting yourself
&gt; into a corner where the system needs re-architecting rather than
&gt; implementing another constraint as an extension.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What I'd love to get is an answer like: POST /orders/1/cancel is not

&gt;&gt; &gt; or implicitly says it's not allowed or it's discouraged.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, what are you expecting to GET from /cancel, or are you just using
&gt;&gt; that URL to invoke a procedure? [...]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Suggested reading: 6.5.2; 6.2.1, in particular:
&gt;&gt; "REST [defines] a resource to be the semantics of what the author
&gt;&gt; intends to identify."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Exactly.  And we don't know what the author intends to identify just by
&gt; looking at the path /orders/1/cancel.
&gt;
&gt; Just looking at the syntax of a single request (e.g. the method POST and/or
&gt; the path /orders/1/cancel) is not enough to determine if the system adheres
&gt; to any particular architectural style.
&gt;
&gt; The author may well intend that /cancel identifies a resource, and allow
&gt; lots of interaction in it.  It might even have an HTML representation, with
&gt; a nice &lt;form method="post"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="CANCEL"&gt;&lt;/form&gt; in
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; But this is still not enough to determine if a system adheres to the
&gt; constraints: For even though the server provides such hypermedia controls,
&gt; media types and does everything "by the book", it is still up to the
&gt; *client* to actually *use* these hypermedia controls.  In fact it is up to
&gt; the author of the agent itself.
&gt;
&gt; If you write code in the client that hard wires a button called "cancel" to
&gt; the "POST /orders/1/cancel" HTTP request then the client isn't really
&gt; honouring the hypermedia controls laid out above.  If, however, it _soft
&gt; wires_ the same button _because_ of the hypermedia control above, then
&gt; you're doing it "more right" I would say.  The point is that the client
&gt; should be written in such a way that it uses _only_ the hypermedia controls
&gt; that it receives at run-time.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Roy's thesis really must be considered in its entirety, [...]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; +1 to such a degree that 1 &gt; 1.  The rest of the stuff you wrote was great.
&gt; I just want to highlight the incorrectness of the question, as others said
&gt; earlier that REST doesn't say anything about if POST /foo is or isn't...
&gt; For all we know /orders/1/cancel is a picture of a dog, or it could be a
&gt; SOAP endpoint for a nice game of Global Thermonuclear War.
&gt;
&gt; The constraints of REST are too often thought / taught to deal with the
&gt; server side, but in my experience, it has much more to do with the client
&gt; side, how much knowledge the client has on things like:
&gt;
&gt; - what URLs can it use? (it shouldn't know any; but bind to one at run-time,
&gt; preferably via a configuration parameter)
&gt; - when it knows one URL (e.g. "/orders/1"), can it add "/cancel" to it to
&gt; cancel it?  (no, unless it was told to add "/cancel" by a hypermedia
&gt; control)
&gt; - does it know the "type" of a resource, e.g. that /orders/1 is an Order
&gt; (this is a point of contention on the list; browsers don't know about books
&gt; or a bank account, but work fine nonetheless.)
&gt; - when it does know the type of the URL is an order, does it pull up a
&gt; pre-coded "order" UI (bad), or does it create a UI based on what it finds in
&gt; the response (good)

The implementation of PATCH with a body 'status=Canceled' can be
tricky if you also accept changes to other fields, which may or may
not have some logic associated to them. I think that using a
subresource as Nicholas Shanks suggested is a good solution, e.g.

PUT /orders/1/status

Canceled

The implementation can do something like this:

switch (value) {
   case "Canceled":
      cancelOrder(id);

As an aside you'll find maintenance and validation easier if your status values are all lowercase (all upper would be okay too, but uglier.) 

Has nothing to do with REST, it's just easier to deal with when you don't have to worry what is the proper casing of status values. FWIW.

This seems like a really important point. As I started reading about

server programmers could change URIs as requirements evolved. But it seems
you can only realize that benefit easily if you can guarantee that all your
clients use the hypermedia controls, or that you force the issue by
breaking clients that aren't honoring that agreement. Hypermedia APIs seem
to raise the expectations on client programmers more than for server
programmers.

As a server programmer, I'm interested to find great examples of hypermedia
APIs (and ecosystems, documentation, etc.) that help their client
programmers do the right thing.

Even then, if you can't prevent client developers from "deep linking" into
your API, how do you handle breaking changes for those clients?

this is a very good question. one important aspect is that it's always 
bad if clients are tested against just one implementation. server 
programmers often put quite a bit of effort into designing pretty URIs, 
which is good. but this also lures client programmers into relying on 
those patterns, and as long as you just test against one implementation, 
things often work fine.

however, often there only is one implementation to test against, so what 
then? something i've been thinking about (and nothing more, and also i 
haven't seen any frameworks supporting this) would be that server 
frameworks could have a "test" switch, that would start serving "ugly" 
and pretty much random URIs, instead of the pretty designed ones. a test 
installation could then be easily provided to client programmers, and 
their code would break very quickly in all places where they took 
shortcuts, instead of following links.

i haven't seen support for this so far, but it seems to me that in many 
REST-oriented server-side frameworks, this might not be all that hard to 
add. if somebody has seen such a thing in practice, please let me know!

&gt;

DELETE /orders/1 doesn't have to delete the resource, it can move it to,
say, /canceled/1.  In which case you're only changing one property of
the order "object" on your server -- its mapping.  REST isn't CRUD.  In
a hypertext API, it's often best to have different URI paths for the
same set of server objects, if their policies vary based on a property
like status...

Web servers configure policies based on path, so add another URI mapping
instead of making server logic more complex by trying to apply different
policies based on parsing content for 'canceled=true'.  Try to think in
terms of hypertext applications instead of serializing objects to
hypertext -- status isn't a field in a hypertext document in REST when
its semantics overlap that of HTTP status responses, especially if
status varies by user role:

The customer checking /orders/1 knows they've successfully canceled it,
because their DELETE request responded 200 OK with the order and new
status in the message body, and that URL now responds to GET with 410
Gone.  The 410 response may include the order as its entity, or not,
for the customer role.

Other user roles, i.e. admin, may get redirected to /canceled/1, where
they are subject to different policies than exist for an active order.
Admins may DELETE from /canceled to actually delete a canceled order,
while customers are 403 Forbidden from entering /canceled to begin with.
Also, just because you're using the DELETE method, doesn't mean the UI
has to say "delete" on the cancel control.

&gt;
&gt; The implementation of PATCH with a body 'status=Canceled' can be
&gt; tricky if you also accept changes to other fields, which may or may
&gt; not have some logic associated to them.
&gt;

What matters is user intent.  Clear intention to cancel an order should
unambiguously be its own operation from the UI-design perspective; from
the protocol perspective, this idempotent user action should be made
explicitly visible on the wire by selecting the most appropriate HTTP
method.

Of all manipulations we may allow for an order, this is the only one
that's self-explanatory without transferring a representation, another
indication that DELETE has the semantics we're after, provided we don't
get hung up on having to delete something -- which we don't!

If, to the requesting user, canceling an order makes it go away, then
using DELETE meets the self-descriptive messaging and uniform interface
constraints of REST.  What happens to the order is an implementation
detail, hidden behind the uniform interface.  To the world-at-large,
the traffic pattern of an order cancellation looks like exactly what it
is, as the principle of generality has been followed.

The visibility of DELETE allows intermediaries to mark cached copies
of /orders/1 as stale. This optimization is built-in to the deployed
infrastructure of the Web, all it does here is ensure the requesting
user doesn't re-load a stale copy of /orders/1 which fails to reflect
the results of the action just taken.  This can't be done with PATCH,
even if you can get close by marking the request as idempotent.

&gt; 

Yes, such examples are out there, but in them, /cancel is NOT a resource
in the REST sense so they must be some style of RPC... REST, not so
much. Representational State Transfer means just that -- resources are
manipulated by transferring representations of their current, intended,
desired etc. state.  Chapter 5.4:

"Requests and responses have the appearance of a remote invocation
style, but REST messages are targeted at a conceptual resource rather
than an implementation identifier."

This example is a REST anti-pattern, as I cannot deduce the current
(sub)state of the order (active or canceled) by dereferencing the URL
I'm given for manipulating that (sub)state. Just making a toggle POST
also fails to transfer any representation of anything, let alone
application state, and isn't proper HTTP (which can never be proper
REST).

REST isn't about optimizing upstream traffic, it's about optimizing GET.
What advantage does a subresource give when it contains no content from
the parent resource?  My goal with subresources is to increase the cache
stickiness of their parent resources.  Replace the subresource content
in the parent resource, with a link or a hypertext control linked to the
subresource.  The link or hypertext control remains static, and cached,
as the content of the subresource varies.

That's a RESTful pattern, as the subresource now has a representation
(other than that of the 406 error) we can transfer and manipulate to
effect change of the parent resource.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not the semantics of a method invocation.  What does /cancel
&gt; &gt; identify? Sounds to me like a method of tunneling DELETE through
&gt; &gt; POST which identifies nothing, iow a procedure endpoint, which is
&gt; &gt; characteristic of various styles but not of the REST style.  The
&gt; &gt; hypertext constraint only makes sense if your resources make sense,
&gt; &gt; in that their URLs are identifiers rather than endpoints.
&gt; 
&gt; If I understand correctly, you are saying that if I need to affect a
&gt; resource then I should use the uniform interface on that resource URI,
&gt; and not another URI.
&gt; 

Absolutely not!  My example changed /order/1 by manipulating /order/1
/status.  The /order/1 resource includes its status, but its 200 OK
representations only include links to the /status subresource, derived
from the /order/1 resource such that manipulating a representation
of /order/1/status updates /order/1 (on the server, you can do anything
you want; on the client, the cached link/control in /order/1 now returns
a different value).

There's no cost to adding a URI like this, nor does it preclude changing
order status via PUT/PATCH to /order/1.  The difference is that /status
uses REST's uniform interface, unlike /cancel.  The /order/1/status URL
is only presented within a hypertext control which explains how to
manipulate it -- picture a drop-down list with the current status
highlighted, meeting the hypertext constraint.  You can always GET the
status of an order even if you don't have a copy of that order, a
useful separation of concerns beyond just optimizing GET, promoting
serendipitous re-use.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Which brings us to Chapter 5, and the short answer to your question:
&gt; &gt; "POSTing to /cancel violates the Identification of Resources
&gt; &gt; constraint, and is therefore unRESTful."  But I've found that just
&gt; &gt; giving that answer tends to upset folks who've only read Chapter 5,
&gt; &gt; then they get defensive about why can't they call their API
&gt; &gt; RESTful, accusations of pedantry follow, and threads devolve into
&gt; &gt; general ugliness, heheh...
&gt; 
&gt; After reading that chapter again I'm not sure my example violates
&gt; anything, but I'd love to get more clarification from you. Is it the
&gt; use of a verb in the URI? or not using the URI of the resource I'm
&gt; trying to modify directly?
&gt;

The biggest problem, is that an RPC endpoint which has no GET function
while improperly listening for a method itself as a trigger rather than
taking action based on the content of the entity required by that method
and in obeyance of the semantics of that method, is so far away from
REST that I don't know where to start except by urging that Roy's
thesis be read in its entirety.  Because it's obvious to me that this
violates the first three uniform interface constraints, making adherence
to the fourth irrelevant:

"REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of
resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-
descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application
state."

Note that "noun/verb" terminology is not present in the dissertation.
But, yeah, if your URI is a "verb" you're probably getting REST wrong.
There is no "cancel" method in the uniform interface.  There are two
basic means of solving this -- one, is refactor your cancel operation
to use DELETE; two, tunnel your proprietary cancel method through POST.

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/19210

Making this operation its own URI doesn't make it more RESTful, as the
resulting URI is only a resource in the HTTP/URI sense, but not the
REST sense, of the term.  Utilizing subresources to break out more
dynamic aspects of content and cache them separately is RESTful; if the
contents of the GET are also allowable content of a PUT then we're
letting hypertext drive application state instead of listening for POST
events to trigger server-object methods we've failed to refactor to the
uniform REST interface.

<pre>Thank you very much for your responses Eric.

The short answer is (if I understood correctly): POST /cancel is not
REST because it lacks visibility, since it's not possible to
understand the client's intent by examining the request.

Never thought about HTTP/URI resource vs. REST resource, you say that
a URI that doesn't implement GET is probably (or always) not REST.

&gt;&gt; If I understand correctly, you are saying that if I need to affect a
&gt;&gt; resource then I should use the uniform interface on that resource URI,
&gt;&gt; and not another URI.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Absolutely not!  My example changed /order/1 by manipulating /order/1
&gt; /status.  The /order/1 resource includes its status, but its 200 OK
&gt; representations only include links to the /status subresource, derived
&gt; from the /order/1 resource such that manipulating a representation
&gt; of /order/1/status updates /order/1 (on the server, you can do anything
&gt; you want; on the client, the cached link/control in /order/1 now returns
&gt; a different value).
&gt;
&gt; There's no cost to adding a URI like this, nor does it preclude changing
&gt; order status via PUT/PATCH to /order/1.  The difference is that /status
&gt; uses REST's uniform interface, unlike /cancel.  The /order/1/status URL
&gt; is only presented within a hypertext control which explains how to
&gt; manipulate it -- picture a drop-down list with the current status
&gt; highlighted, meeting the hypertext constraint.  You can always GET the
&gt; status of an order even if you don't have a copy of that order, a
&gt; useful separation of concerns beyond just optimizing GET, promoting
&gt; serendipitous re-use.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Which brings us to Chapter 5, and the short answer to your question:
&gt;&gt; &gt; "POSTing to /cancel violates the Identification of Resources
&gt;&gt; &gt; constraint, and is therefore unRESTful."  But I've found that just
&gt;&gt; &gt; giving that answer tends to upset folks who've only read Chapter 5,
&gt;&gt; &gt; then they get defensive about why can't they call their API
&gt;&gt; &gt; RESTful, accusations of pedantry follow, and threads devolve into
&gt;&gt; &gt; general ugliness, heheh...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; After reading that chapter again I'm not sure my example violates
&gt;&gt; anything, but I'd love to get more clarification from you. Is it the
&gt;&gt; use of a verb in the URI? or not using the URI of the resource I'm
&gt;&gt; trying to modify directly?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The biggest problem, is that an RPC endpoint which has no GET function
&gt; while improperly listening for a method itself as a trigger rather than
&gt; taking action based on the content of the entity required by that method
&gt; and in obeyance of the semantics of that method, is so far away from
&gt; REST that I don't know where to start except by urging that Roy's
&gt; thesis be read in its entirety.  Because it's obvious to me that this
&gt; violates the first three uniform interface constraints, making adherence
&gt; to the fourth irrelevant:
&gt;
&gt; "REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of
&gt; resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-
&gt; descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application
&gt; state."
&gt;
&gt; Note that "noun/verb" terminology is not present in the dissertation.
&gt; But, yeah, if your URI is a "verb" you're probably getting REST wrong.
&gt; There is no "cancel" method in the uniform interface.  There are two
&gt; basic means of solving this -- one, is refactor your cancel operation
&gt; to use DELETE; two, tunnel your proprietary cancel method through POST.
&gt;
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/19210
&gt;
&gt; Making this operation its own URI doesn't make it more RESTful, as the
&gt; resulting URI is only a resource in the HTTP/URI sense, but not the
&gt; REST sense, of the term.  Utilizing subresources to break out more
&gt; dynamic aspects of content and cache them separately is RESTful; if the
&gt; contents of the GET are also allowable content of a PUT then we're
&gt; letting hypertext drive application state instead of listening for POST
&gt; events to trigger server-object methods we've failed to refactor to the
&gt; uniform REST interface.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, what are you expecting to GET from /cancel, or are you just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using that URL to invoke a procedure? If so, then there are a few
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; places Roy's thesis admonishes against it in Chapter 6 -- the rest
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of REST is about positive, rather than negative, reinforcement of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the identification of resources constraint. Suggested reading:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6.5.2; 6.2.1, in particular: "REST [defines] a resource to be the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; semantics of what the author intends to identify."
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; To clarify, /orders/1/cancel is used to modify a resource, using POST.
&gt; &gt;&gt; A GET request would result in a Method Not Allowed response.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, such examples are out there, but in them, /cancel is NOT a resource
&gt; &gt; in the REST sense so they must be some style of RPC... REST, not so
&gt; &gt; much. Representational State Transfer means just that -- resources are
&gt; &gt; manipulated by transferring representations of their current, intended,
&gt; &gt; desired etc. state. Chapter 5.4:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Requests and responses have the appearance of a remote invocation
&gt; &gt; style, but REST messages are targeted at a conceptual resource rather
&gt; &gt; than an implementation identifier."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This example is a REST anti-pattern, as I cannot deduce the current
&gt; &gt; (sub)state of the order (active or canceled) by dereferencing the URL
&gt; &gt; I'm given for manipulating that (sub)state. Just making a toggle POST
&gt; &gt; also fails to transfer any representation of anything, let alone
&gt; &gt; application state, and isn't proper HTTP (which can never be proper
&gt; &gt; REST).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; REST isn't about optimizing upstream traffic, it's about optimizing GET.
&gt; &gt; What advantage does a subresource give when it contains no content from
&gt; &gt; the parent resource? My goal with subresources is to increase the cache
&gt; &gt; stickiness of their parent resources. Replace the subresource content
&gt; &gt; in the parent resource, with a link or a hypertext control linked to the
&gt; &gt; subresource. The link or hypertext control remains static, and cached,
&gt; &gt; as the content of the subresource varies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's a RESTful pattern, as the subresource now has a representation
&gt; &gt; (other than that of the 406 error) we can transfer and manipulate to
&gt; &gt; effect change of the parent resource.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not the semantics of a method invocation. What does /cancel
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; identify? Sounds to me like a method of tunneling DELETE through
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; POST which identifies nothing, iow a procedure endpoint, which is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; characteristic of various styles but not of the REST style. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hypertext constraint only makes sense if your resources make sense,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in that their URLs are identifiers rather than endpoints.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If I understand correctly, you are saying that if I need to affect a
&gt; &gt;&gt; resource then I should use the uniform interface on that resource URI,

&gt; 

I'd phrase it differently:  "POST /cancel violates self-descriptiveness
as user intent cannot be discerned by examining the request."  This
would hold true even if GET /cancel had a 200 OK response.  Even that's
oversimplifying in that part of the reason POST is wrong here, is
because DELETE is right.  But, no, I do not believe setting up an URL to
listen for POST and taking action not based on anything in the POST
request, is ever an example of the REST style, regardless of the nature
of the resource.

My real short answer is, "POST /cancel doesn't use REST's uniform
interface."

Neither is it an example of the REST style for POST to have a definition
which varies by resource, iow sometimes it works without an entity
(method-tunnel listener), sometimes it doesn't (create resource); even
if hypertext-driven, such nonstandard method usage inevitably results
in coupling between client and server, instead of relying on shared
understanding of standardized method semantics.  Fixing the POST to have
an entity that's ignored might make it valid HTTP and solve this, but it
still wouldn't be an example of the REST style, where the requested
state change is transferred in the entity (with a few exceptions) -- not
defined per resource by the method being tunneled through / triggered by
POST.

Conceptually, it still violates the identification of resources
constraint, which is why it isn't visible regardless of how we implement
it in terms of hypertext or method selection.  Using the uniform
interface means refactoring internal methods like 'cancel' to fit the
resource/representation model of REST such that the request methods and
response codes used map generically to those of your chosen protocol.
Assigning them URIs to toggle with semantically-void messages is simply
some other style not encompassed by REST's uniform interface constraint,
not something that's superficially fixable by improving visibility or
adding a 200 OK response.

&gt;
&gt; Never thought about HTTP/URI resource vs. REST resource, you say that
&gt; a URI that doesn't implement GET is probably (or always) not REST.
&gt;

More like, "REST resources are concepts, not actions."  Just using URIs
doesn't bestow compliance with the identification of resources
constraint upon a system, it's more nuanced than that.  I can't imagine
why a bona-fide REST resource would ever deliberately fail to have a
retrieval mapping, no.

I think the more important takeaway is method selection.  We have DELETE
in order to avoid such convoluted POST-based cancel mechanisms.  It
isn't RESTful to use POST when another method's semantics happen to
closely describe user intent.  From Roy's blog:

"POST only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which
some other method is ideally suited: e.g., retrieval of information
that should be a representation of some resource (GET), complete
replacement of a representation (PUT), or any of the other standardized
methods that tell intermediaries something more valuable than 'this may
change something.' The other methods are more valuable to
intermediaries because they say something about how failures can be
automatically handled and how intermediate caches can optimize their
behavior. POST does not have those characteristics, but that doesn't
mean we can live without it. POST serves many useful purposes in HTTP,
including the general purpose of 'this action isn't worth
standardizing.'"

http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post

Since DELETE is inherently self-descriptive of user intent to cancel an
order, and is already "listened for" rather than requiring an entity be
transferred, and has inherent idempotency matching the inherently
idempotent user intent captured by a cancel request, DELETE must be the
proper method for implementation using HTTP.

Now, maybe your media type doesn't support DELETE, in which case
contriving a /cancel URI may very well be called for until such time
as it does.  I won't fault anyone for doing this out of pragmatism, so
long as they understand it as a mismatch, inconsistent with the
architectural style they're following.

REST is a tool which allows you, over time, to make improvements to the
architecture you have in accordance with an idealized model.  To me,
accepting mismatches for what they are, is far more useful than coming
up with convoluted explanations for why they aren't, for the sake of
buzzword compliance.  Change is easier when it's based on having been
right all along, rather than based on having to admit error.  ;-)

i just sumbitted an initial draft of "URI Template Descriptions" as 
draft-wilde-template-desc-00. however, it seems that there currently is 
a bit of delay before submissions become actually visible, so in the 
meantime i'd like to announce the draft on this list, and start 
gathering feedback. i'll send a brief note once the draft is available 
through the official IETF channels.

all of this is still work in progress, but i thought it would be great 
to get community feedback early on. at 
https://github.com/dret/I-D/tree/master/template-desc you can find the 
document sources, as well as a schema (yes, it's XSD) td-00.xsd and a 
simple sample description document td-paging-00.xml. since this is meant 
to be for describing and documentation, td-00.xslt is a simple XSLT that 
can be used to generate a simple HTML version of the description. 
td-paging-00.xml links to this stylesheet, and XSLT-capable browsers 
will render the HTML client-side. but you can also simply look at 
td-paging-00.html for the static HTML version.

for now, i'd be interested in feedback about the idea as a whole, as 
well as about features/capabilities you'd like to see added, if you are 
considering this to be something that could be useful for you. 
implementation-wise, i'd like to add URI Template support to the code 
(but then it needs to be XSLT 2.0 and stops working client-side), so 
that it would be possible to parse the URI Template, and match variables 
in it against variables in the description.

thanks and cheers,

They are more powerful than mere URI lists, which are limited in the number of URIs you can communicate, and HTML forms, which can only express a more limited set of URIs (i.e., the variable part has to use query parameters).

&gt;hello all.
&gt;
&gt;i just sumbitted an initial draft of "URI Template Descriptions" as 
&gt;draft-wilde-template-desc-00. however, it seems that there currently is 
&gt;a bit of delay before submissions become actually visible, so in the 
&gt;meantime i'd like to announce the draft on this list, and start 
&gt;gathering feedback. i'll send a brief note once the draft is available 
&gt;through the official IETF channels.
&gt;
&gt;all of this is still work in progress, but i thought it would be great 
&gt;to get community feedback early on. at 
&gt;https://github.com/dret/I-D/tree/master/template-desc you can find the 
&gt;document sources, as well as a schema (yes, it's XSD) td-00.xsd and a 
&gt;simple sample description document td-paging-00.xml. since this is meant 
&gt;to be for describing and documentation, td-00.xslt is a simple XSLT that 
&gt;can be used to generate a simple HTML version of the description. 
&gt;td-paging-00.xml links to this stylesheet, and XSLT-capable browsers 
&gt;will render the HTML client-side. but you can also simply look at 
&gt;td-paging-00.html for the static HTML version.
&gt;
&gt;for now, i'd be interested in feedback about the idea as a whole, as 
&gt;well as about features/capabilities you'd like to see added, if you are 
&gt;considering this to be something that could be useful for you. 
&gt;implementation-wise, i'd like to add URI Template support to the code 
&gt;(but then it needs to be XSLT 2.0 and stops working client-side), so 
&gt;that it would be possible to parse the URI Template, and match variables 
&gt;in it against variables in the description.
&gt;
&gt;thanks and cheers,
&gt;
&gt;dret.

&gt; kind of thing, albeit with the former being more flexible in kinds of
&gt; URI it can generate than the latter?

nicholas did not really say what he means by "forms". but typically, 
forms are a combination of (1) a template (which may be runtime or baked 
into the media type as in HTML), (2) a set of values (described to some 
extent) that can be populated when submitting the form, and (3) maybe 
some UI info for rendering it (in UI-oriented form languages).

you could look at "URI Template Descriptions" as starting with RFC 6570 
as the standard for templates (1), adding some description structure for 
the variables (2), and leaving any UI stuff (3) as something that could 
be packaged in the extension model, if required.

cheers,

dret.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

Why doesn't authorization violate the statelessness constraint of REST? 
It seems to reduce visibility (monitoring systems need to know both the 
request datum AND the user's access rights to understand a request) and 
scalability (server needs to store access-control metadata across 
requests). What makes this different from, say, personalizing a response 
based on the client's username?

&lt;/snip&gt;
you can use the Authorization header to make the auth info visible

server's don't need to "understand" access rights, just apply them. think
about cases where the authentication is done by party A (oAuth), the
authorization list is handled by party B (UMA), and the source material to
access is handled by party C.

&lt;snip&gt;
and scalability (server needs to store access-control metadata across
requests).
&lt;/snip&gt;
there is no requirement that servers MUST store AC data across requests. in
fact, i don't to this in my work. maybe an auth proxy does it, however.

&lt;/snip&gt;

There's nothing inherently unRESTful about personalization.  Basing it
on digest auth gives us caching advantages over both cookies, and tying
it to /{username}/ URI allocation schemes.  What we're after in REST is
optimizing the hell out of GET, remember...

Say I have a resource called "newsletter" I want all guests to be able
to read, personalized for registered members using client-side XSLT to
handle the mail-merge. The HTML representation of the newsletter must
be the same for all users so we can set cache-control: public.  It
contains code which calls an XSLT transformation residing in an
external .xsl file, whose URL must not vary for the sake of caching.

But, that .xsl resource doesn't need to return the same representation
for all users.  The personal.xsl resource sets Vary: Authorization and
has no 401 or 403 response.  It has a 200 OK response which sets cache-
control: public for unauthorized users, personalizing the newsletter for
"Guest" (as opposed to, say, "Dave") which functions as a login link;
whereas Dave would be linked to his control-panel UI.  For example.

Authenticated users GET a 303 redirection to the personal.xsl file in
their user directory, which has cache-control: private set.  Note that
the personal.xsl files in this example apply to all newsletters, so
it's useful to cache them.  Note also that this is all invisible to the
user, dereferencing the newsletter resource results in a personalized
newsletter application steady-state -- which is a representation of the
newsletter resource the user dereferenced.

Actually, the HTML representation should be personalized for Guest by
default, with the guest personal.xsl file containing an identity
transform (does nothing).  Also, the 303 redirects are cache-control:
private.

We can expand the example to only work this way for user-agents which
Accept: application/xhtml+xml (which all do client-side XSLT 1 nowadays)
while performing the XSLT transformation server-side and sending the
personalized 200 OK response as text/html with cache-control: private
for other user-agents (public, if not logged in).  What this does is
expand the set of representations such that each user now has two
possible 200 OK responses, HTML and XHTML.  Don't forget Vary: Accept.

This isn't "the" RESTful way to do personalization, merely my attempt
at a very simple example of basic mail-merge functionality in the REST
idiom, to help answer your questions...

&gt; 
&gt; Why doesn't authorization violate the statelessness constraint of
&gt; REST?
&gt;

I'm going to turn that around on you, and ask what is it about my
example you find stateful, specifically?

&gt;
&gt; It seems to reduce visibility (monitoring systems need to know
&gt; both the request datum AND the user's access rights to understand a
&gt; request)
&gt;

Not really; intermediaries just need to know a user *has* access rights.
As to visibility, if my example didn't have that property, it wouldn't
have graceful degradation from highly-cacheable client-side merging
down to cache-miss server-side merging.

&gt;
&gt; and scalability (server needs to store access-control metadata across
&gt; requests).
&gt; 

Sorry, not seeing it.  The access-control metadata is part of the
request, which leads to scalability.  That a cookie is being used as
access-control metadata is not apparent from such a request.  It seems
to me that the worst-case scenarios in my example, in terms of
scalability vis-a-vis cache-hit ratio, are the best-case scenarios of
non-RESTful approaches to personalization.

IOW, that most requests cause processing on the server is what's
expected with cookies, while REST gives me the means to avoid even
contacting the server in many if not most cases, for the given example.
The more millions of users, the greater the likelihood the newsletter's
already cached closer to the user than the origin server, meaning
server resource utilization per-user decreases as users increase, which
is the real payoff to REST.

Subject:Re: Working on an ASP.NET Web API book<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>And now the real message. :-)

&lt;forgive me if you think this is spam&gt;

Howard Dierking, Pablo Cibraro and Pedro Felix, Darrel Miller, and I are
all working on a new Oreilly
book&lt;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026617.do&gt;on building Web
APIS using
ASP.NET Web API. Our goal for the books is three:

1. We want to give real world guidance on building evolvable and robust APIs
2. We want to show how to apply that to ASP.NET Web API i.e. hypermedia,
caching, security, etc.
3. We want to describe the ASP.NET Web API architecture / technical
components.

The book is in progress and hopefully going to publish in sprint. It's
online &lt;http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449337711&gt; now however as we're
using Oreilly's OSS model so folks can see it as it progresses and weigh in
(for free).

Whether you are or are not an ASP.NET developer, I would love your
feedback. Granted if you are not a .NET dev, we understand. Note, there are
several chapters which focus on fundamentals of HTTP, media type design etc
and have NOTHING to do with .NET.

Anyway, thanks in advance and we look forward to your feedback.

Thanks!
Glenn

Subject:Atom + Member URIs<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>We have been having an interesting discussion here regarding the AtomPub
protocol.

Is it ok to change the MemberUri on a put? EG: Return a Location header and
then point to a new MemberUri?

Example:
You have
/feed/0

you put new data

it returns
Location: /feed/74

The feed is updated and no longer does /feed/0 show up in the feed (top
entry is now /feed/74).

There are some advantages (and disadvantages) to this mechanism and I am
not sure if its allowed or not.

The big thing I see as it breaking is people that want to bookmark all of
MemberUris. Is this a good idea in the first place? This could be worked
around as well by returning a moved with the new link if you use the old
Uri. There is already an edit rel link in the feed itself.

That said most people I see using atom are directly bookmarking their
MemberUris and this would probably break them and is as such a meaningless
practical discussion. But is it protocol compliant?

Cheers,

Greg

Abstract:
    This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/csv MIME
    entities.  These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to
    parts of a text/csv MIME entity, identified by cell, row, column, or
    slice.

Note to Readers

    This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [12].
