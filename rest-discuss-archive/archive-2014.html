Subject:Real Examples of REST in Action?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

Several months ago I read Architectural Styles and the Design of 
Network-based Software Architectures and have since been occasionally 
reading here and other discussions on the web and have come to the 
conclusion that a) most non-HTML web services aren't REST and b) they 
probably should be. I was wondering though, are there any real-world 
(hopefully prominent?) examples of services adhering completely to the 
REST constraints that aren't based around HTML/CSS/JS (minus cookies) or 
Atom? I think it would give me a better sense of what REST looks like in 
practice to see more individual instances.

Thanks,
Shea Levy

<pre>I can't claim my Restful Objects spec [1] is particularly prominent or
well-known, but it is in use and fulfils your criteria.

You can see it in use by running one of the Apache Isis maven archetypes
[2,3]; there is also a .NET implementation [4]

Subject:Media Type for resource archives<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

I am thinking about a media type for bundling together a bunch of resources[1] into a single file. With these files I want to store a manifest file.

One option would be to just use a zip-based format and an manifest file with a well known name.

The problem with this is that useful stream processing of such a file can only be done by ensuring that the manifest is the first entry when unzipping. Apparently it requires some stunts to control the ordering of the zip entries and who knows whether the other end uses a compatible implementation.

Solution would be to unpack to disk first and go from there. Not nice.

A possible alternative would be to use a multipart format where I can simply require the manifest to be the first part. Then just zip that file or rely on transfer encoding to reduce the bytes on the wire.

Nice things about that:
- Ordering is guaranteed
- Full support for per-part MIME headers
- Content-Length enables fast splitting of the parts
- cid: URIs make for natural, standard URI-references inside the file
- stream processing without temporary storage

I am interested in reactions to the two alternatives or any ideas beyond that.

<pre>Look at QUIC, and consider this format and sequence:

&lt;script src=... type="application/json+quic" var="abc" index="123"/&gt;
&lt;script src=... type="application/json+quic" var="abc" index="456"/&gt;
&lt;script src=... type="application/json+quic" var="abc" index="789"/&gt;

Let the browser recognize the same manifest (...), let the extra micro-data
wrap up the statement:

var abc[123] = ... ;

Slight modification to change "var"+"index" to "part" is another solution.
I hope something like this makes HTML6.

Subject:Atom entries for change events of resources (looking for appropriate link relation)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

Suppose I have a set of resources for which changes can be tracked in an Atom feed. In such a feed every Atom entry would represent a single change event to a specific resource in the set.

For the sake of simplicity of the example below, suppose that the entry only notifies about the change as such. Of course, one could include a diff and/or the kind of event in the entry, too (e.g. new/update/delete).

What I am looking for is a link relation that is a good fit for linking from the entry to the changed resources. I am thinking

- about:  &lt;link rel="about" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;
- via: &lt;link rel="via" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;

Mint one:
- observed: &lt;link rel="observed" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;
- pertains: &lt;link rel="pertains" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;
- concerns: &lt;link rel="concerns" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Employee Changes Feed Subscription Document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T17:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Change of Employee 7628827272 &lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link rel="about" href="/employees/7628827272"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;summary&gt;Some text describing the change, possibly a change comment&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/feed&gt;

About stands out as a clear winner IMHO.

"Employee 12345"... is the subject of ..."this change event"

FWIW, Mark Nottingham's awesome cache channels draft[1] from 2007 used the
alternate link relation (top of page 7):

   Entries in the feed represent events, in reverse-chronological order.
   The atom:link element(s) with the "alternate" relation determines the
   URI(s) that an event is applicable to.

Yes, I like that, too. Especially vs minting one. OTH, there is the proximity to RDF/Linked Data semantics.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Thanks for reminding me. I kinda think 'alternate' means 'can stand in as' which is not true in my case. Ian S. Robinson also used alternate in hist Infoq talk.

<pre>Here is one link for experiments:
 http://blog.chromium.org/2013/06/experimenting-with-quic.html

Since IPv6, we can use Content-Length to describe parts of the entire UDP
transfer. From that base, there are several ideas how to describe contents
of the parts, especially with Content-Type. QUIC adds connection
identifiers.

In my previous post here, even if there is no manifest, the connection
identifier could cause each &lt;script&gt; to source from the same single
transfer.

I used one similar implementation that batched 10,000+ separate requests
into packets that were only split by time instead of size. That was before
QUIC.

Notice the trade-off to wrap up &lt;script&gt;s without jQuery overhead (or JS
loaders).

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Media Type for resource archives<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Jan,

Have you run across the WARC format yet [1]? It was built for serializing representations of resources for the Web archiving domain (Internet Archive, etc) but it seems like it might have some relevance for your use case? Basically a WARC is a concatenation of HTTP responses, but you can also layer in the requests that generated them, DNS lookups, etc. Each WARC record has an id, which amounts to a manifest, and you have the ability to layer in arbitrary metadata if necessary.

WARC is ISO 28500:2009 and ISO make you pay for the spec :-( But implementors generally know you can get the latest draft before it went to ISO for free from the Bibliothèque nationale de France who (along with a lot of other national libraries) also use it for the Web archiving efforts [3]. ArchiveTeam also have a decent list of software packages that support WARC [4].

The ResourceSync effort might also be of interest, in particular their idea of a Resource Dump [5] — although I believe work on ResourceSync is ongoing, and may be in flux. Last time I looked ResourceSync added some extensions to Google Sitemaps that let you point at a file in a ZIP archive, and list its media type, byte length, and hash … which sounds a bit like what you might want out of a manifest?

I’d be interested to hear what you come up with, whether you use either of these options or not.

&gt; Hi Jan,
&gt;
&gt; Have you run across the WARC format yet [1]? It was built for serializing
&gt; representations of resources for the Web archiving domain (Internet
&gt; Archive, etc) but it seems like it might have some relevance for your use
&gt; case? Basically a WARC is a concatenation of HTTP responses, but you can
&gt; also layer in the requests that generated them, DNS lookups, etc. Each WARC
&gt; record has an id, which amounts to a manifest, and you have the ability to
&gt; layer in arbitrary metadata if necessary.
&gt;
&gt; WARC is ISO 28500:2009 and ISO make you pay for the spec :-( But
&gt; implementors generally know you can get the latest draft before it went to
&gt; ISO for free from the Bibliothèque nationale de France who (along with a
&gt; lot of other national libraries) also use it for the Web archiving efforts
&gt; [3]. ArchiveTeam also have a decent list of software packages that support
&gt; WARC [4].
&gt;
&gt; The ResourceSync effort might also be of interest, in particular their
&gt; idea of a Resource Dump [5] — although I believe work on ResourceSync is
&gt; ongoing, and may be in flux. Last time I looked ResourceSync added some
&gt; extensions to Google Sitemaps that let you point at a file in a ZIP
&gt; archive, and list its media type, byte length, and hash … which sounds a
&gt; bit like what you might want out of a manifest?
&gt;
&gt; I’d be interested to hear what you come up with, whether you use either of
&gt; these options or not.

+1 for about. http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6903 doesn’t really mention RDF/Linked Data semantics, but I think you’re correct that it came from that domain. So I think you’re safe :-)

being seriously unsure, I take this to the group:

Is it ok to use Content-Location header in the MIME Headers section of the parts?

What I need to do is to provide the URI where each part can be retrieved individually.

Or would maybe a Link &lt;&gt;; rel=self be better?

<pre>My understanding is that the GET request is your query, and that the query string is for modifying the query.  It seems like what you are doing is very similar, if not exactly filtering the query to certain instances, and therefor the query string would be the most appropriate avenue for expressing that modification of the query.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Some rules of thumb that might help:

1. Fragments are for client-side use. In general, the client shouldn't send
the fragment portion of the URL to the server.
2. Query strings are for both clients and servers. The server can expect
the client to compose a query string from many parts.
3. URI paths are for servers. The client should treat the path portion as
opaque and avoid parsing it or composing it.
4. There's a convention mentioned in RFC 3986 indicating to use ';' to
separate the hierarchical portion of a URI path from a non-hierarchical
part. Both parts remain opaque to the client; the distinction should only
be meaningful to the server.

Subject:User Hypermedia format<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>/* pardon the cross-posting */

I just published a first working draft of a new hypermedia format I am
(humbly) calling "Uber Hypermedia"[1]. I'm maintaining it in github[2]
where you can post issues, clone/PR, etc. if you like.

It is designed to be *very* minimal. It has only three elements, 11
attributes, and seven reserved strings.

Here is some text from the opening:
&lt;snip&gt;
The Uber message format is a minimal read/write hypermedia type designed to
support simple state transfers and ad-hoc hypermedia-based transitions.
This document describes both the XML and JSON variants of the format and
provides guidelines for supporting Uber messages over the HTTP protocol.

The Uber message model has a number of design goals:
- Keep the message structure as lean as possible.
- Support all the H-Factors [HFactor] in hypermedia controls.
- Be compatible with multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, CoAP, etc.)
- Maintain fidelity for more than one base message format (XML, JSON, etc.)
&lt;/snip&gt;

I'm looking for any/all feedback here or in the repo space.  Thanks in
advance.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi there,

I like it a lot, and might just rewrite some of my stuff into using this
instead of my own (similar) format, just for the heck of it. :)

Quick question; using the @model, is it assumed the model works as an
extension to the current URI? Ie, if the current URI is "
http://test.com/page" and there's a model there "?param=data" we just plonk
it on the current URI, but using a more RESTful approach can often be
@model="/{fiddle}/{foo}" so would that work as an appender to the current
URI? I have a lot of URI templates around that use the structure like this,
so would be good to just confirm that.


Cheers,

Alex

yes, it's implied, but not clear and possibly not right. in XML innerText
is "untyped" unless more info is provided (via the message or a schema). in
JSON it's easier to express type w/o metadata ("value":13},
{"value":false}, "value":"mike"}).

hmm....

what's the smart thing to do here (given i'd like to keep fidelity across
serilization formats as much as possible)?

<pre>Matt:

I reviewed the JSON serializations and made a couple corrections. thanks
for the catch and would appreciate your scan again to catch any remaining
problems.

I've also added some text to the "value" definition to say JSON format MUST
only be set to string, number, or literals (true, false, null) and MUST NOT
be set to object or array. What is then implied (not yet stated in the
prose) is that, to pass arrays or objects in the "value" attribute, you
need to *escape* the object/array and pass as a string.

Does this make sense?

&gt; yes, it's implied, but not clear and possibly not right. in XML innerText
&gt; is "untyped" unless more info is provided (via the message or a schema). in
&gt; JSON it's easier to express type w/o metadata ("value":13},
&gt; {"value":false}, "value":"mike"}).
&gt;
&gt; hmm....
&gt;
&gt; what's the smart thing to do here (given i'd like to keep fidelity across

&gt;&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are the values of "value" properties always strings? It looks so in all

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just published a first working draft of a new hypermedia format I am

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is designed to be *very* minimal. It has only three elements, 11

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Uber message format is a minimal read/write hypermedia type designed

&gt;&gt;&gt; This document describes both the XML and JSON variants of the format and

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The Uber message model has a number of design goals:
&gt;&gt;&gt; - Keep the message structure as lean as possible.
&gt;&gt;&gt; - Support all the H-Factors [HFactor] in hypermedia controls.
&gt;&gt;&gt; - Be compatible with multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, CoAP, etc.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; - Maintain fidelity for more than one base message format (XML, JSON,

Glad to hear this looks promising. This is a first draft so it's likely
some things will drift.  I am also very much interested in what you find as
you start your implementation. feedback on confusions/shortcomings in the
design will be most helpful.

as for the use of @model. this is applied to the associated @url in the
same &lt;data&gt; element. That means you have full control over how much is in
the @model and how much is in the @url. That includes path segements, etc.
just as outlined in RFC6570.

Does this clarify things?

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I like it a lot, and might just rewrite some of my stuff into using this
&gt; instead of my own (similar) format, just for the heck of it. :)
&gt;
&gt; Quick question; using the @model, is it assumed the model works as an
&gt; extension to the current URI? Ie, if the current URI is "
&gt; http://test.com/page" and there's a model there "?param=data" we just
&gt; plonk it on the current URI, but using a more RESTful approach can often be
&gt; @model="/{fiddle}/{foo}" so would that work as an appender to the current
&gt; URI? I have a lot of URI templates around that use the structure like this,
&gt; so would be good to just confirm that.
&gt;
&gt;

Only where RFC6570 is clear. :) I guess I'm responding to the examples
from the website where for example we've got ;

&lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
model="{&amp;title}" /&gt;

Which I assume is applied to that URL with a ?param structure, but what with ;

&lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
model="/{&amp;type}/{&amp;title}" /&gt;

Will that resolve to http://example.org/search/{type}/{title}? If yes,
then I understand how RFC6570 applies to the format. If no, I need
education.

i might add some prose that sets expectations on which level of support for
RFC6570 is needed in order to be uber-compliant. that might lower the bar
for implementation.

<pre>Hi Mike

Cool to see this. I am looking over the format. I can see there's some CJ
footprints there ;-)

Question on transclude. What do you mean when you say that if it is true it
should be embedded in the current document, do you mean it is already
present inline?

I am asking in reference to this example:

              {
                "name" : "person",
                "rel" : "item",
                "url" : "http://example.org/people/1",
                "data" :
                [
                  {"name" : "givenName", "value" : "Mike"},
                  {"name" : "familyName", "value" : "Amundsen"},
                  {"name" : "email", "value" : "mike@..."},
                  {"name" : "avatarUrl", "transclude" : "true",
"value" : "http://example.org/avatars/1"}
                ]
              },


Above, transclude is true. Where is the embedding / how does it play in?

Thanks
Glenn

I'll let Mike correct me if I'm wrong but I believe transclusion is analogous to the behavior of an &lt;img&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt; element in HTML. It's telling the client to fetch the transcluded resource, just including it by reference instead of by value.

<pre>Yep - Matt's got it.

these are equivalent:

&lt;data url="..." rel="logo" transclude="true" /&gt;
and
&lt;img src="..." rel="logo" /&gt;

&gt; telling the client to fetch the transcluded resource, just including it by

&gt; Hi Mike
&gt;
&gt; Cool to see this. I am looking over the format. I can see there's some CJ
&gt; footprints there ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Question on transclude. What do you mean when you say that if it is true
&gt; it should be embedded in the current document, do you mean it is already
&gt; present inline?
&gt;
&gt; I am asking in reference to this example:
&gt;
&gt;               {
&gt;                 "name" : "person",
&gt;                 "rel" : "item",
&gt;                 "url" : "http://example.org/people/1",
&gt;                 "data" :
&gt;                 [
&gt;                   {"name" : "givenName", "value" : "Mike"},
&gt;                   {"name" : "familyName", "value" : "Amundsen"},
&gt;                   {"name" : "email", "value" : "mike@..."},
&gt;                   {"name" : "avatarUrl", "transclude" : "true", "value" : "http://example.org/avatars/1"}
&gt;                 ]
&gt;               },
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Above, transclude is true. Where is the embedding / how does it play in?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hiya,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; as for the use of @model. this is applied to the associated @url in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same &lt;data&gt; element. That means you have full control over how much is
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the @model and how much is in the @url. That includes path segements,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. just as outlined in RFC6570.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Does this clarify things?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Only where RFC6570 is clear. :) I guess I'm responding to the examples
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the website where for example we've got ;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
&gt;&gt;&gt; model="{&amp;title}" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Which I assume is applied to that URL with a ?param structure, but what
&gt;&gt;&gt; with ;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
&gt;&gt;&gt; model="/{&amp;type}/{&amp;title}" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Will that resolve to http://example.org/search/{type}/{title}? If yes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then I understand how RFC6570 applies to the format. If no, I need
&gt;&gt;&gt; education.

<pre>The idea being that rel(s) and their transcludability are likely to diverge
over time, and are therefore worth keeping separate? Have there been any
examples of this in the wild?

Also, were there specific reasons to split this out as its own control
element instead of just sticking to rels like this:

&lt;data rel="img logo" url="..." /&gt;

Cheers,

&gt;&gt; Hiya,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; as for the use of @model. this is applied to the associated @url in the
&gt;&gt; same &lt;data&gt; element. That means you have full control over how much is in
&gt;&gt; the @model and how much is in the @url. That includes path segements, etc.
&gt;&gt; just as outlined in RFC6570.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Does this clarify things?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Only where RFC6570 is clear. :) I guess I'm responding to the examples
&gt;&gt; from the website where for example we've got ;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;data name="search" rel="search" url=" &lt;http://example.org/search&gt;

Is transclude a widely understood term? Did you consider having an
attribute like link-type with values of 'outbound' or 'inbound'? When I
first read H-Factors, the usage of outbound and inbound was very obvious.
Transclude was not.

Just sharing my experience / very first impression.

&gt;
&gt; Question on transclude. What do you mean when you say that if it is true
&gt; it should be embedded in the current document, do you mean it is already
&gt; present inline?
&gt;
&gt; I am asking in reference to this example:
&gt;
&gt;               {
&gt;                 "name" : "person",
&gt;                 "rel" : "item",
&gt;                 "url" : "http://example.org/people/1",
&gt;                 "data" :
&gt;                 [
&gt;                   {"name" : "givenName", "value" : "Mike"},
&gt;                   {"name" : "familyName", "value" : "Amundsen"},
&gt;                   {"name" : "email", "value" : "mike@..."},

&gt;                 ]
&gt;               },
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Above, transclude is true. Where is the embedding / how does it play in?
&gt;

<pre>Inbound sounds like a reference from a different resource to a given resource. Do you mean Embedded? Or is there a precedent for describing transclusion, embedding as inbound?

&gt; Is transclude a widely understood term? Did you consider having an attribute like link-type with values of 'outbound' or 'inbound'? When I first read H-Factors, the usage of outbound and inbound was very obvious. Transclude was not.

<pre>Hi Mike,

Is a client obligated to load H-Factors associated with an embed directive?
E.g. I may have an affordance (form) with an list of options for some field
that is included as an embed directive, but unless I am exercising that
related affordance, it does not make sense to pre-load that list of options.

And if embed directives are at the discretion of the client, is the point
of an embed h-factor more a hint that you may want to load this in parallel
or whatever? Or should a client blindly load these h-factor elements?

How would one differentiate an h-factor that should be loaded only for a
optional affordance vs. auto-loaded regardless?

That is, if something should always be embedded, how would one determine
what should be specified for auto-loading by the client?

Mark

<pre>a client is "obligated" as much as HTML is "obligated" to honor the IMG tag
vs. the A tag.

clients can decided what to render/ignore and how to render all
on their own.

servers are free to not even indicate this, too. all &lt;data url="..." /&gt; are
valid w/o "transclude" and clients can be left to decide on their own how
to handle them.

How does the XML format represent true, false, and null?

How does the XML format represent objects and arrays? (Some sadist will put
JSON in there unless we have a better answer.)

More generally, I imagine your intent is to constrain clients to adopt more
of a tolerant reader approach and use less automatic serialization and
deserialization.

At the same time, I think there's potential value in making compound,
complex data more of a first class citizen. Allowing bare object and array
data representations (not serialized into a quoted string) would let
clients and servers reach inside the data without additional explicit
deserialization steps.

I guess one risk of allowing objects and arrays is the antipattern of using
a single data element whose value is a very complex object.

What are the tradeoffs you're trying to balance?

all good Qs...

"How does the XML format represent true, false, and null?"
****
so far, the approach i have is to treat this all as text data:
&lt;data transclude="false" /&gt;

it's possible to go further into this space using XML Schema, but I am not
really interested in backing that into the format design. You could
*definitely* use it by adding a &lt;data url="..." rel="schema" /&gt; element at
the top of a representation. if that's what you want do to.
****

"How does the XML format represent objects and arrays? (Some sadist will
put JSON in there unless we have a better answer.)"
****
in XML there is no intrinsic Array pattern, just an implied one
&lt;data rel="collection" ...&gt;
  &lt;data rel="item" ... /&gt;
  &lt;data rel="item" ... /&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;

is usually converted into an array in code.

JSON does this differently, of course by *requiring* explicit use of Array
in the representation.
****

"More generally, I imagine your intent is to constrain clients to adopt
more of a tolerant reader approach and use less automatic serialization and
deserialization."
****
bingo! ;)

my designs almost always attempt to downplay direct serialization into/from
code. The trouble is programming languages can change over time and I'd
like to make sure my designs don't favor (or become dependent) upon a
sub-set of programming languages.
****

"At the same time, I think there's potential value in making compound,
complex data more of a first class citizen. Allowing bare object and array
data representations (not serialized into a quoted string) would let
clients and servers reach inside the data without additional explicit
deserialization steps."
****
Keeping in mind what you describe here is a "programmer optimization" there
are lots of ways to do this. We all got used to converting XML into code by
way of "black box" functions in a language. We also got used to converting
JSON into code in languages that didn't have the same internal structure as
javascript. we did this w/ black box code.

We can do the same with Uber (or any format, really). We need a DOM for
that ,but it's not too hard; esp. with something like Uber that allows for
recursion in the model.
****

"I guess one risk of allowing objects and arrays is the antipattern of
using a single data element whose value is a very complex object."
****
right, the killer is that messages become "envelopes" for code. this is
what i am trying to avoid. I am trying to design format where messages are
messages "all the way down" ;)

this means there is "heavy lifting" in creating the message (serialization)
and parsing it for use ("de-serialization") and I want to keep that heavy
lifting in code on each end - not in the message design itself.   For
example the appeal of JSON is that there is "zero" lifting if you are
writing javascript. However, that value dwindles as you get into other
languages (erlang, python, etc.).

"What are the tradeoffs you're trying to balance?"
****
i'm experimenting here with ways to make it easier to express a wide range
of use cases in a minimal format. and ways to make it easier to
parse/validate the message regardless of platform or language.

in my Cj design i actually created a design that gave a bit "middle finger"
to serializers everywhere&lt;g&gt;. i also tried to make to really hard to pass
recursive messages by forcing a very flat structure in the message model.

with Uber, i am working on the other end of that set of values. i want to
create a model that leads devs into creating recursive messages. but I am
still working to thwart attempts to create code envelopes. Uber is a kind
of "proxy" for objects on either end of the convo, not a "high-fidelity
object tree tunnel" (if that makes any sense).

hope this helps and love to hear more from you on this.

I'd like a format that just let me represent that part of a message as a compact first class array.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] User Hypermedia format<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>understood:

so in the XML flavor you certainly can do a CDATA pattern and embed a
custom object in the message. this reduces it's usefulness to anyone except
those who write custom apps (or use your custom libs/plugins) that
understand this embedded object.

i suspect we can set up some similar thing in the JSON variant (the ability
to embed arbitrary objects/trees in an Uber msg) and the same would apply -
only those pre-built to understand what's already coming would be able to
use that representation.

of course, this assumes that the idea of existing Uber clients being able
to read/process/display your data w/o additional custom coding is even a
value for you. it may not be.


Now, to back up a bit.

1) is this really about programmer optimization? id yes, a few bits of code
that translates the internal data into Uber is not a big deal and could
solve that problem.

2) is this about payload size? i don't think uber adds much weight at all
here (the JSON flavor is certainly more compact than the XML one). and when
you're talking about 180,000 data points. that's a pretty big chunk of data
anyway. you're free to use compression on the outbound with will greatly
reduce the added weight since repeated chars compress very nicely.

3) finally, what format are you using now? have you looked at HAL? it is
designed to host arbitrary objects in a wrapper.  I'd be interested to see
some comparisions (custom format, HAL, Uber) not just of size of the
representation but also the size of the compressed response and the cost to
process (surely the Uber will be the most costly to process, right?)

anyway, this is all good stuff and i'd love to follow up on what you're
doing now and how a change to something like Uber will make things diff for
you.

&gt;&gt; Cool to see this. I am looking over the format. I can see there's some CJ

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Question on transclude. What do you mean when you say that if it is true
&gt;&gt; it should be embedded in the current document, do you mean it is already
&gt;&gt; present inline?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am asking in reference to this example:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;               {
&gt;&gt;                 "name" : "person",
&gt;&gt;                 "rel" : "item",
&gt;&gt;                 "url" : "http://example.org/people/1",
&gt;&gt;                 "data" :
&gt;&gt;                 [
&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "givenName", "value" : "Mike"},
&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "familyName", "value" : "Amundsen"},
&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "email", "value" : "mike@..."},
&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "avatarUrl", "transclude" : "true", "value" : "http://example.org/avatars/1"}
&gt;&gt;                 ]
&gt;&gt;               },
&gt;&gt;

<pre>That feels right. The media type and the client requirements are somewhat independent, no? This affects servers also, possibly with different expectations. 

A related concept that might be valuable to express is whether a reference is "logically included" in the referring resource or if it's some other kind of relationship. Does transclusion express exactly that or merely an overlapping concept?

Message:<br><br>
<pre>right. transclude="true" is a hint. just like embed="true" is a hint in Cj.

as Matt points out, the client intent may not be the same as the server's
suggestion and that's fine. the server doesn't (or shouldn't) worry about
that detail.

FWIW, i talked about this idea a while back with the notion of "Aspects"[1]
where some affordance details are server-focused (idempotence [HTTP.POST v.
HTTP.PUT] &amp; safety [HTTP.GET v. HTTP.DELETE])and some are client-focused
(mutability [HTML.A] and transclusion [HTML.IMG]). The server stuff is a
strong network promise, the  client stuff is a local promise.

anyway, in Uber the "send-format" and "receive-format" are also loose
promises. just like HTML.A@type is a loose promise (hint).

i want to offer folks the oppty to include this when they wish and let
clients and servers sort out whether they treat them as strong or weak
promises.

make sense?

&gt; of course, this assumes that the idea of existing Uber clients being able to read/process/display your data w/o additional custom coding is even a value for you. it may not be.

Right. Good points. And it makes me think we could make the conversation less theoretical and more concrete if we turned our attention to what clients and servers will be able to do with Uber without deeper knowledge of data payloads. Do you have some implementation underway?

&gt; Now, to back up a bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) is this really about programmer optimization? id yes, a few bits of code that translates the internal data into Uber is not a big deal and could solve that problem.

Maybe it's a local optimization, but IME, many programmers will not take that step. If it were in a library that would help. I'm imagining passing an arbitrary object to the Uber library and getting an escaped string representation suitable as "value" data out. 

&gt; 2) is this about payload size? i don't think uber adds much weight at all here (the JSON flavor is certainly more compact than the XML one). and when you're talking about 180,000 data points. that's a pretty big chunk of data anyway. you're free to use compression on the outbound with will greatly reduce the added weight since repeated chars compress very nicely.

Without incentives or constraints, IME, many developers would skip the compression step. If you're in control of both clients and servers in your system you can use convention to ensure compression. But it seems we're aiming at a format for distributed development. 

&gt; 3) finally, what format are you using now? have you looked at HAL? it is designed to host arbitrary objects in a wrapper.  I'd be interested to see some comparisions (custom format, HAL, Uber) not just of size of the representation but also the size of the compressed response and the cost to process (surely the Uber will be the most costly to process, right?)

Indeed, we are using HAL. What you suggest would be good tests.

https://rawgithub.com/mamund/media-types/spec-fixes/uber-hypermedia.html

This covers most of the suggestions I've had to date on cleaning up the
spec and making the JSON variant more canonical.

&gt; right. transclude="true" is a hint. just like embed="true" is a hint in Cj.
&gt;
&gt; as Matt points out, the client intent may not be the same as the server's
&gt; suggestion and that's fine. the server doesn't (or shouldn't) worry about
&gt; that detail.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, i talked about this idea a while back with the notion of
&gt; "Aspects"[1] where some affordance details are server-focused (idempotence
&gt; [HTTP.POST v. HTTP.PUT] &amp; safety [HTTP.GET v. HTTP.DELETE])and some are
&gt; client-focused (mutability [HTML.A] and transclusion [HTML.IMG]). The
&gt; server stuff is a strong network promise, the  client stuff is a local
&gt; promise.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, in Uber the "send-format" and "receive-format" are also loose
&gt; promises. just like HTML.A@type is a loose promise (hint).
&gt;
&gt; i want to offer folks the oppty to include this when they wish and let
&gt; clients and servers sort out whether they treat them as strong or weak
&gt; promises.
&gt;
&gt; make sense?

&gt;&gt; That feels right. The media type and the client requirements are somewhat
&gt;&gt; independent, no? This affects servers also, possibly with different
&gt;&gt; expectations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A related concept that might be valuable to express is whether a
&gt;&gt; reference is "logically included" in the referring resource or if it's some
&gt;&gt; other kind of relationship. Does transclusion express exactly that or
&gt;&gt; merely an overlapping concept?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll let Mike correct me if I'm wrong but I believe transclusion is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analogous to the behavior of an &lt;img&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt; element in HTML. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; telling the client to fetch the transcluded resource, just including it by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reference instead of by value.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Mike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cool to see this. I am looking over the format. I can see there's some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CJ footprints there ;-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Question on transclude. What do you mean when you say that if it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true it should be embedded in the current document, do you mean it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already present inline?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am asking in reference to this example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;               {
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 "name" : "person",
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 "rel" : "item",
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 "url" : "http://example.org/people/1",
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 "data" :
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 [
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "givenName", "value" : "Mike"},
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "familyName", "value" : "Amundsen"},
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "email", "value" : "mike@..."},
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                   {"name" : "avatarUrl", "transclude" : "true", "value" : "http://example.org/avatars/1"}
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;               },
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Above, transclude is true. Where is the embedding / how does it play in?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i might add some prose that sets expectations on which level of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hiya,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; as for the use of @model. this is applied to the associated @url in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same &lt;data&gt; element. That means you have full control over how much is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the @model and how much is in the @url. That includes path segements,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. just as outlined in RFC6570.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Does this clarify things?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Only where RFC6570 is clear. :) I guess I'm responding to the examples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the website where for example we've got ;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model="{&amp;title}" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which I assume is applied to that URL with a ?param structure, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what with ;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;data name="search" rel="search" url="http://example.org/search"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model="/{&amp;type}/{&amp;title}" /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will that resolve to http://example.org/search/{type}/{title}? If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then I understand how RFC6570 applies to the format. If no, I need

Mike, please, now, if you're going to specify something for XML, give it an
official namespace identifier, and REQUIRE/MUST it.

The beauty of XML is that you can mix and mash it up, and you can't
(easily) do that without a namespace.

&lt;uber xmlns="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;data&gt; ... &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/uber&gt;

&lt;u:uber xmlns:u="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;u:data&gt;...&lt;/u:data&gt; &lt;/u:uber&gt;

&lt;ü:uber xmlns:ü="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;ü:data&gt;...&lt;/ü:data&gt; &lt;/ü:uber&gt;

(that would be annoying, but it's amusing in context...anyway...just an
abbreviation, could be anything)

Lots of folks don't namespace their data, and when used internally and
privately, that's fine.

But as soon as you start sharing it, or using it with other XML techs (XML
Sig, SOAP, SAML, etc.)  things can get messy, especially for an overarching
framework like you're proposing. The framework shouldn't interfere with the
data.

By getting this settled up front, you won't have to worry about legacy
implementations (notably XSL) that rely upon your data not having a
namespace breaking if/when you change it to add one. This is why you
REQUIRE it, XML code is different if the elements are namespaced or not,
un-namespaced and namespaced XML files aren't "the same".

So, anyway, my 2 cents. I'll crawl back in to my hole.

Will Hartung

+1, regardless of how much people love to hate namespaces.

what also would be required for robustness (this boils down to the fact 
that every format needs a processing model):

- talk about how to handle unspecified attributes
- talk about how to handle unknown elements in the Ã¼ber namespace
- talk about how to handle elements in non-Ã¼ber namespaces

all of this combined will give the result will wants to see: how to use 
Ã¼ber in a way that's extensible and open. on the other hand, if Ã¼ber 
claims to be an RDFish approach that can do anything because of its 
generality (which is how i see it for now), then it also would be fine 
to say that it cannot be extended or combined with anything, because any 
extension would have to be done *in* Ã¼ber instead of *of* Ã¼ber. that's a 
design question of the model itself, bit for the representation design 
in XML, will's suggestion makes a lot of sense.

I'm not convinced that using namespaces really gets you anything here.  You're developing an internet media type, so you are free to specify how it may /may not be extended.  MicroXML might in fact be all that you need.  Why complicate matters for unknown / unspecified requirements?  KISS

I know, I know, I like to just bang my drum and hear myself...uh..type, or something...however.
Mike, please, now, if you're going to specify something for XML, give it an official namespace identifier, and REQUIRE/MUST it.
The beauty of XML is that you can mix and mash it up, and you can't (easily) do that without a namespace.
&lt;uber xmlns="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;data&gt; ... &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/uber&gt;
&lt;u:uber xmlns:u="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;u:data&gt;...&lt;/u:data&gt; &lt;/u:uber&gt;

&lt;ü:uber xmlns:ü="urn:uberisuber"&gt; &lt;ü:data&gt;...&lt;/ü:data&gt; &lt;/ü:uber&gt;
(that would be annoying, but it's amusing in context...anyway...just an abbreviation, could be anything)

Lots of folks don't namespace their data, and when used internally and privately, that's fine.
But as soon as you start sharing it, or using it with other XML techs (XML Sig, SOAP, SAML, etc.)  things can get messy, especially for an overarching framework like you're proposing. The framework shouldn't interfere with the data.
By getting this settled up front, you won't have to worry about legacy implementations (notably XSL) that rely upon your data not having a namespace breaking if/when you change it to add one. This is why you REQUIRE it, XML code is different if the elements are namespaced or not, un-namespaced and namespaced XML files aren't "the same".
So, anyway, my 2 cents. I'll crawl back in to my hole.

Will Hartung

Namespaces were designed to address one real technical requirement: to prevent name clashes.

This requirement could be addressed in the current case by a suitable schema / processing description in the 
registration.  Why throw in all the XML legacy stuff when you're starting fresh.  If one ever would like to see
browser support for a media type based on Uber, (other than its json variety), it would
be smart to leave out namespaces, rather than force all subsequent designers to adopt them (once they're in
they stay in).  If somebody needs to use namespaces in their extensions, I guess it would
be ok to let them.

To take an example, Atom and AtomPub.  Atom says that foreign markup must be ignored. 
Foreign markup in the Atom namespace is reserved for future Atom vocabularies. 
Along came AtomPub.  What did they do?  They added a new namespace.  What will happen
if there is another update?  More namespaces, I suspect.  

The AtomPub extension to the vocabulary could have been done with no new namespace and described
by the media type registration (s).  


&gt; namespaces are a touchy topic, so when you use them, you're likely to
&gt; get some pushback. i'd say live with that, but others will definitely
&gt; feel differently.

This is that pushback ;-)

Subject:hypermedia-driven Web query solving<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi hypermedia/REST people,

You might like our latest hypermedia client implementation.
It solves queries over Linked Data by using hypermedia:
http://client.linkeddatafragments.org/
(Web version of https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Client).

A server offers basic Linked Data Fragments (http://linkeddatafragments.org/);
they are pieces of a dataset, together with metadata and controls.
The collection of fragments forms a hypermedia API.

The client is given a SPARQL query and one fragment of the dataset.
For instance, we start from the fragment
http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/dbpedia?object=dbpedia%3ABarack_Obama
and the query:
    SELECT ?p, ?c WHERE {
        ?p a &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Artist&gt;.
        ?p &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace&gt; ?c.
        ?c &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "York"@en.
    }
As you can see when you open the fragment in your browser,
there is a form that allows to retrieve triple fragments.
So for each of the 3 triple patterns in the above query,
corresponding fragments are retrieved through the form.
The fragment with the smallest resultset is used to solve subqueries.
This process is then repeated to solve the entire query;
all while following hypermedia controls at each step.
You can see this hypermedia step happen here:
https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Client/blob/85b67be35/lib/LinkedDataFragmentsClient.js#L33

Have a look at the high-level algorithm here:
http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2014/03/11/towards-web-scale-web-querying/#querying-with-linked-data-fragments
Detailed algorithm:
http://linkeddatafragments.org/publications/ldow2014.pdf#page=5

Hypermedia is crucial for this type of querying,
because we want to be able to query any type of server
without requiring out-of-band knowledge.
Additionally, we don't want to assume that one server has all fragments,
so links on a fragment can target fragments on other servers as well.

The hypermedia formats supported by our server are HTML+RDFa / Turtle / JSON-LD.
The client supports HTML+RDFa and Turtle.
We use the Hydra vocabulary (http://www.w3.org/community/hydra/) to express the hypermedia controls in RDF.
The use of Hydra should enable other hypermedia-driven clients to consume fragments as well.
More details on our use of Hydra here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-hydra/2014Mar/0051.html

Looking forward to your feedback, and I'm available for comments and questions.

Best,

Ruben

Subject:[Announce] New Restlet Framework and APISpark releases<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

We have just released a *major 2.2.0 version* of our open source web API
framework, including community contributions from 40 developers. See blog
post for changes summary:
http://blog.restlet.com/2014/03/27/restlet-framework-2-2-0-and-2-3-m1-released/

Restlet Framework *2.3 Milestone 1* is also available, including support
for Java 7. Next milestones will add support for API documentation,
management and tooling, through integration with APISpark, Swagger and
other API descriptions languages. See the detailed road map:
http://restlet.org/learn/roadmap

Launched in 2005, Restlet Framework was the first framework to embody the
REST and HTTP principles as a simple client/server Java API. It is
available in 6 consistent editions: Android, GAE, GWT, Java SE, Java EE and
OSGi. It is also at the core of our *APISpark* cloud platform that recently
reached version 2.0:
http://blog.restlet.com/2014/03/11/apispark-2-0-released/

---

Beyond this announce, I would be happy to hear what you think about the
relationship between open source projects and cloud platforms for Web API
developments. Complementary or alternatives?

Thanks!
Jerome

Subject:A RESTFul health check<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I'm interested in building verifications into a REST service to help with service monitoring, where I can verify properties about resources, and I'd like to know if there's any prior art or best practices people can recommend. For example, a service might look like:

http://example.com/posts/verify?min-posts=5&amp;since=1-hour-ago

which would respond with an error unless 5 new posts had been created in the past hour, thus indicating the system might not be operating correctly and is in need of further manual investigation. A service like this would allow me to use any standard HTTP service monitoring tool or hosted service (such as Pingdom) to report a warning should the call fail, and it's flexible enough to support multiple checks of this nature (e.g., http://example.com/posts/verify?min-comments=100&amp;since=1-day-ago).

As for the response, I feel the appropriate content would be an indication of correctness along with the actual value ("All good! 20 posts were created in the past hour" or the equivalent in the requested content type.) Pragmatically, it's important to respond with different codes for success and failure. 200 seems fine for success, but I'm not sure what codes would make the most sense for a failed verification?</pre><br><br><br><br><br>

Subject:Resources and presentation views<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 Several question:
 

       1. How does REST treat the notion of alternate presentation views for resource instances?
 
For example suppose you want to model various views of a â€œReportâ€ such as â€œPie Chartâ€ / â€œHistogramâ€ .. that all share a common media type (text/html). How would such scenario be implemented using HTTP in RESTful way? 

2.  Are resources required to expose a public URL or can they be thought of conceptually part of other resources Value Set without any URL? 


 For example suppose that all Report views are modeled as dependent resource that are implicitly created when the client POSTS a Report to a Reports Collection, is there any requirement to maintain a URL for the Report resource instance itself such as /Reports/1 (assuming all access is limited through views) What would be a proper response to such HTTP POST ?

/Reports/1/PieChart
/Reports/1/Histogram
 

 3.    According to the URL RFC 3986 different query strings produce different resource identifiers, is there any advantage to model alternate view resources using path components over query parameters or vice versa, (seems like same thing) ?

Thanks,

have a report resource that contains types links to the various views, 
which are resources themselves. this allows clients to link to those 
views, or to link to the more abstract general report. also, if 
possible, include backlinks from the views, so that a client accessing a 
view can find the general report resource.

&gt; 2.Are resources required to expose a public URL or can they be thought

&gt; POST ?
&gt; /Reports/1/PieChart
&gt; /Reports/1/Histogram

you could make /Reports a "POST-only" resource, but i'd suggest to keep 
/Reports/1 around because

- it's a convenient starting place to find all view links
- it allows you to DELETE an entire report
- it may also link to or contain additional info such as a history or 
whatever else may be interesting about a report apart from the views

&gt; 3.According to the URL RFC 3986 different query strings produce
&gt; different resource identifiers, is there any advantage to model
&gt; alternate view resources using path components over query parameters or
&gt; vice versa, (seems like same thing) ?

it's similar and to some extent, query strings are a historical aspect 
of URI syntax. usually, people use paths when resource structure and 
navigation is clearly hierarchical (and then being able to "hack" URIs 
in the address bar can be very convenient), and query strings are used 
when things get more complicated, such as multiple dimensions of how 
resources are related. that being said, keep in mind that good REST 
designs should not depend on specific URI patterns anyway, you should 
have a logical view of how you interlink resources. using "pretty URIs" 
then makes your service nicer to use, but your design should work in the 
very same way, regardless of whether you use /Reports/1/pie or 
/Reports/1?view=pie

cheers,

d.

Subject:Accept Header returned by a Server<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello, 
 

 The "affordance" (way to be used)  of a given Server IRI is described by the Content-Type header returned by OPTIONS, but
 apparently nothing is provided to publish the media type of resources which may be POSTed to the IRI.
 The only "well known" ways are, to my knowledge: 
 - a return HTML FORM containing "accept" attributes
 - an ATOM payload (there is only one media type, easy)
 

 In a similar way, using a Link (or Link-Template) header only allows the "type" parameter describing what the IRI may return on GET, and not what it may accept with POST. 
 

 Is it totally meaningless to consider the use of the Accept header in a server response to list the media types of resources which may be POSTed to the IRI? 
 It could be also considered to consider the user of "accept=" attribute in the syntax of the Link header for the same purpose. 
 

 Since this idea seems trivial and is (apparently) not used, it is perhaps silly: what do you think ?

Subject:Reactive REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The "reactive" buzzword has been conspicuously absent from this list. 
I'll try to fill this much needed gap.

I've recently watched a presentation by Jafar Husain

  http://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-reactive-rest

where he describes something he calls "Reactive REST". I agree on the 
"reactive", however I have doubts about the "REST". In this particular 
case, all communication between a client and a server is over persistent 
connection to a single endpoint. If there's anything resembling 
resources, they are not identified by URIs. The persistent connection 
IMHO is a case of "conversational" state that REST is rather opposed to. 
No HATEOAS in sight.

What I'm pondering is whether an API can be RESTful and reactive at the 
same time or if is impossible as a matter of principle. AFAICT, a 
reactive API requires some way for the server to send events to the 
client. I don't think polling qualifies, which leaves a persistent 
connection. In effect, the server has to keep some amount of state for 
each session.

Keeping session state has traditionally been regarded as a hindrance to 
scalability. Has technology advanced so much, eg with asynchronous, 
event-driven ("reactive") servers, that this is no longer a problem?

haven't really seen it buzzing that much, but if you had to give it at 
least a little substance, how would you explain what it means? just 
something that's driven by events rather than clients?

sounds like websockets (maybe not technically, but as the general idea). 
to me, REST is on a different level than this plumbing. in the same way 
as you can do REST and notREST over HTTP, the same probably applies to 
any of the alternative interaction styles. as you point out, REST has 
more (and more abstract) constraints than just the protocol that's used.

&gt; What I'm pondering is whether an API can be RESTful and reactive at the
&gt; same time or if is impossible as a matter of principle. AFAICT, a
&gt; reactive API requires some way for the server to send events to the
&gt; client. I don't think polling qualifies, which leaves a persistent
&gt; connection. In effect, the server has to keep some amount of state for
&gt; each session.

not sure i agree that polling or long polling are the only (or best) 
alternatives. there's quite of stuff to be done in the area that i often 
refer to as "reverse REST": clients subscribe, and then there's a push 
model. there are a variety of push protocols (PuSH, MQTT, APN, C2DM, 
sMAP) out there, but none so far has taken over the world.

it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in june at the w3c's web 
of things workshop. clearly, in sensor scenarios, it would be very 
convenient to have these kind of alerts, have them in a loosely coupled 
and scalable way, and have them via protocols that are universally 
supported. it may be the case that w3c will start working on something 
in that space, but we'll know more after that workshop.

http://www.w3.org/2014/02/wot/

http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil14a is a position paper that we 
have submitted to this workshop. it may be the case that activity 
streams take over as the new atom. we'll see about that, but they are 
not all that different, and they use JSON, so all is good.

and in the same way as you can layer PuSH on atom to have a push model 
on top of atom's data model, you can do the same for activity streams. 
that might be the way open push protocols are going: you can poll for 
activities, or you can subscribe to an activity hub that pushes to you 
whatever you has subscribed to.

in my eyes, this could still be RESTful, only that of course you would 
end up having more resources (such as subscriptions that need to be 
managed and so on).

anyway, a very good question, a very interesting field, and with the 
whole IoT/WoT movement now getting a serious hype push, maybe we'll get 
to something open, useful, and RESTful in the next couple of years.

&gt; Keeping session state has traditionally been regarded as a hindrance to
&gt; scalability. Has technology advanced so much, eg with asynchronous,
&gt; event-driven ("reactive") servers, that this is no longer a problem?

just a question of cost. different protocols have different solutions 
(PuSH subscriptions time out automatically, sMAP subscriptions never 
time out), based on different scenarios. anything push-based is more 
expensive than pure pull, because services/hubs need to keep track of 
subscribers. but if the cost is smaller that the benefit, then this will 
happen one way or another.

&gt; Frankly, I'm lacking experience with systems where this kind of
&gt; scalability would be required, so I'd happily use persistent
&gt; connections, at least to begin with. Nonetheless, I'm interested in your
&gt; insights.

web of things scenarios simply cannot work with long polling. if you 
want to be connected to thousands of sensors in your building to figure 
out when one is telling you that there is a fire, then you cannot have 
open connections to all of them. the answer here is a layered 
architecture, maybe some of it hidden as implementation details (sensors 
just speaking MQTT to a hub), and other things exposed on the web level 
(you being able to subscribe to that hub and get alerts). many solutions 
have been built around this general pattern, but so far we lack a single 
and coherent answer where to draw the boundary between the 
implementation details and the open part, and what we should use for 
that open part. as mentioned above, maybe that workshop will bring 
together enough interested parties to start working on that issue.

cheers,

dret.

wow. this seems to happily combine apples and oranges as well as bacon,

i guess i am having trouble with looking at a connection as a resource 
with state (unless you talk about network monitoring and management 
scenarios, which are an entirely different beast). to me, what changes 
may be a sensor's state, and the question is how to get that information 
to consumers. whether you do it by pulling or pushing really does not 
change the fact that after doing one or the other, the changed resource 
state will be available on the consumer side. it's just that pulling it 
has vastly different characteristics in terms of scaling, which is why 
the web scales so nicely.

but it is entirely possible to envisage that HTTP pull is like UPS 
ground and free, whereas there may be UPS overnight which costs a bit 
but is faster. if you do that, you get to specify your identifier, and 
then (and this is why i call this "reverse REST") you become the 
resource to be pushed to, i.e. your resource needs to be known by the 
event source. there are tons of PubSub approaches out there, only that 
coming up with one that works robustly and in a scalable at web scale so 
far hasn't worked. the main reason is that for pull, sources don't need 
to know the consumers, whereas for push that state needs to be 
maintained, which is expensive.

if you're interested to read a bit more, here's a starting point:

these are two very different questions. they work very well in practice,

(C2DM), in building automation scenarios (sMAP), or in large sensor 
network settings (MQTT). they all come with different design goals and 
constraints, and it seems that you have something specific in mind as 
well. as long as you don't better understand the specific constraints of 
the scenario you have in mind, picking a solution (or writing down the

No, a connection isn't a resource. But keeping a connection open from 
each client to the server puts a strain on the server. Ideally, a 
RESTful service is loaded only "dynamically" in the sense that the 
("static") number of clients is irrelevant, what counts is the 
("dynamic") number of requests per unit of time. My understanding of 
REST is that this is deliberate and very helpful for scalability. Open 
connections are a strain on a service even in the absence of any 
requests. For one thing, a single server can only manage a limited 
number of open connections at a time.

In REST, at least as far as I understand it(!), state is only supposed 
to figure as transferred resource state; session state is prohibited.

My understanding may be wrong and I'm perfectly willing to tone down the 
RESTful ideal for practical purposes. The point I'm trying to make is 
purely a matter of classification, ie that I think persistent 
connections are not RESTful.

So, is "reverse REST" still RESTful? Yes, the individual push request

hinders scalability.

A truly RESTful solution would have to do without such state. *I* don't 
see how that is possible, but that's why I started this discussion.

Also, I'd like to repeat that I don't mean not being RESTful, or not

see how to reconcile statelessness and event-drivenness.

<pre>Hi Michael,

I don't quite follow why you think a permanent HTTP session is against RESTful principles. Isn't the HTTP session management at a different level (transport) than the actual resource management and the stateless principles associated to it?
In the same vein, would you also consider one cannot define a RESTful service over persistent HTTPS connections for instance?

Hubert

Persistent HTTPS connections as well as keep-alive persistent HTTP 
connections make for an interesting case. I do consider them as a kind 
of session state, although arguably not state of the application 
session, but rather session state in the transport layer. The 
justification, as far as I understand it, is that in this case being 
stateful is actually more efficient/scalable than being stateless, 
because establishing a new connection is more expensive than keeping an 
existing connection open for a short time, in case it can be reused by a 
later request.

And the keep-alive time indeed is short. For HTTP (not sure about HTTPS) 
it is much less than 60s.

The case of a persistent connection for receiving events from the server 
is different. Such a connection can't time out after a short time, is 
has to stay open while the client is running.

Anyway, it is surely possible to say that REST is only concerned with 
the application layer and that session state at lower levels is none of 
its business.

HTTP has persistent connections and that's perfectly fine. because it's 
orthogonal to the *interactions*. what would be bad would be if the 
persistent connection established some context that was necessary for 
the individual interactions. what is not a problem at all is to keep the 
TCP connection open and have multiple HTTP interactions across it, 
because that saves networking resources, and reusing the TCP connection 
is just an optimization.

how connections are managed really is not so much a concern for the 
HTTP/REST perspective. it just has to be done in a way that system 
design does not depend on established session state.

&gt;&gt; but it is entirely possible to envisage that HTTP pull is like UPS
&gt;&gt; ground and free, whereas there may be UPS overnight which costs a bit
&gt;&gt; but is faster. if you do that, you get to specify your identifier, and

&gt; from server to client probably qualifies. The architecture as a whole
&gt; probably doesn't. As you write, state needs to be maintained which
&gt; hinders scalability.

it just makes things more expensive, and depending on what you're trying 
to achieve, you might be willing to pay this cost, or not. introducing 
subscribers as resources certainly changes the picture and affects 
scalability quite a bit, but that does not mean that the resulting 
design is not RESTful anymore. as long as interactions are 
resource-oriented and stateless, and resource representations are using 
hypermedia, all is well.

&gt; A truly RESTful solution would have to do without such state. *I* don't
&gt; see how that is possible, but that's why I started this discussion.

http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons might 
be interesting to read, and looks at similar issues. but it also makes 
some assumptions, such as that the service compiling this "here is what 
changed" list access to this information somehow.

&gt; Also, I'd like to repeat that I don't mean not being RESTful, or not
&gt; being reactive, as some kind of condemnation. Both approaches offer very
&gt; sensible advice in general, I'm interested in seeing how well they fit
&gt; together.

it's a good question and one that probably will become increasingly 
important, the more real-time information sources (such as sensors) we 
have, and the more we have apps that want to consume this information. 
personally, i don't think there's an easy answer here, it all depends on 
the scenario.

for example, on http://tiledfeeds.yimingliu.com/ we propose an 
architecture where we aggregate resources spatially, and then build a 
(pull-oriented) delivery architecture on top of that. that works well if 
and only if your resources are spatially distributed. and if you feel 
like it, you could still PuSH-enable those tiled feeds, but then you'd 
run into the "subscriber management cost" issue mentioned above.

if you don't want/need push, you can simply start reading 
http://geofeeds.org/earthquakes/02301021.xml, refresh your copy 
occasionally, and you'll get all the information about major earthquakes 
in california (which right now will never change, because this is a 
static demo and not connected to a live feed of earthquake data).

i am not sure how you get to this conclusion. a client subscription to a

client subscriptions, that is not trivial. but it can be implemented, at 
a certain cost, and when you're willing to do that, then you have those 
subscriptions available to the service, which can then use them to send 
push notifications. that is now services such as APN or C2DM work. it's 
RESTful, if you model it in a way that a client POSTs a subscription and 
can DELETE it when it cancels.

&gt; The other technical pb of pub/sub over HTTP are firewalls or related

yes, for back-end m2m scenarios, URI-based push works. but for pushing 
to mobile devices, it doesn't, because they are not part of the open 
internet (i.e., they don't have a stable public IP address).

&gt; Finally, pub/sub model implies a level of trusts normal HTTP app servers
&gt; do not need to have. Blindly connecting to any HTTP endpoint opens to
&gt; security vulnerabilities. The client (subscriber) will typically expect
&gt; some shared secret or key cert exchange, and the server may not be
&gt; willing to blindly post data to unknown locations.

yes, pubsub probably requires some level of trust, and may just be the 
"premium" way of getting information from a service. for massive scale 
information distribution, pubsub probably really is not a good model, 
but for some other scenarios, that may be different.

cheers,

dret.

&gt; RESTful, if you model it in a way that a client POSTs a subscription and
&gt; can DELETE it when it cancels.


I meant that if state persisted on initial request is pre-requisite for
subsequent requests, then it would break stateless constraint of REST. If
none of the calls make any assumption of any previous context state stored
on the server - following initial request, e.g the subscription state -
then it remains RESTful. If you model the context to be stored on the
server as a resource itself (e.g the subscription resource) it seems
RESTful but the state lifecycle depends on client proper interaction
implementation. But you're right, this is more a design cost/tradeoff issue
than purely a RESTfulness of the system.

&gt;
&gt;  The other technical pb of pub/sub over HTTP are firewalls or related
&gt;&gt; network issues. It is not uncommon that clients have firewalls in place
&gt;&gt; that let outgoing calls but require IP whitelisting to let calls come
&gt;&gt; in. That further reduces scalability of such model (basically each
&gt;&gt; client must be seen as a server and vice-versa). The clients costs is
&gt;&gt; typically higher than server (clients establish the HTTP connection and
&gt;&gt; close them as appropriate for their use cases). This cost is acceptable
&gt;&gt; because you usually have many clients for one server. If the server had
&gt;&gt; to pay that connection cost (eg to push data), it would be central and
&gt;&gt; all clients would deal with a less responsive server as a result.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yes, for back-end m2m scenarios, URI-based push works. but for pushing to
&gt; mobile devices, it doesn't, because they are not part of the open internet
&gt; (i.e., they don't have a stable public IP address).
&gt;
&gt; I think we agree. You bring up another reason why PuSH model is not well
adapted for Web scalability (Web will be mostly mobile over time). "Don't
call me we'll call you" doesn't apply well here.

&gt;
&gt;  Finally, pub/sub model implies a level of trusts normal HTTP app servers
&gt;&gt; do not need to have. Blindly connecting to any HTTP endpoint opens to
&gt;&gt; security vulnerabilities. The client (subscriber) will typically expect
&gt;&gt; some shared secret or key cert exchange, and the server may not be
&gt;&gt; willing to blindly post data to unknown locations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yes, pubsub probably requires some level of trust, and may just be the
&gt; "premium" way of getting information from a service. for massive scale
&gt; information distribution, pubsub probably really is not a good model, but
&gt; for some other scenarios, that may be different.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sure. PuSH "can" be done. But rarely in a scalable way (at least not over
HTTP) unless the number of subscribers is low and you tackle/pay the cost
of the several design issues mentioned in this thread.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Reactive REST<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi Michael,

I signed the reactive manifesto a while ago. I do think the RESTful
applications need to be "reactive". To achieve that, I think a RESTful API
should not only provide the data, but also afford how to manipulate the
data when remote retrieval is expensive and not reliable. Query via path
might be the most straightforward and safest way to that. Thinking about
the model of html, we can hardly develop any modern web applications
without the DOM. Furthermore, maybe sounding crazy, I also think a RESTful
API without code-on-demand is a *dumb* API.

I like what Jafar Husain showed about netflix's approach of jsong and
effective pational caching control. Thanks for the link.

Cheers,

Dong

&gt; &gt; The "reactive" buzzword has been conspicuously absent from this list.
&gt; &gt; I'll try to fill this much needed gap.
&gt;
&gt; haven't really seen it buzzing that much, but if you had to give it at
&gt; least a little substance, how would you explain what it means? just
&gt; something that's driven by events rather than clients?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I've recently watched a presentation by Jafar Husain
&gt; &gt; http://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-reactive-rest
&gt; &gt; where he describes something he calls "Reactive REST". I agree on the
&gt; &gt; "reactive", however I have doubts about the "REST". In this particular
&gt; &gt; case, all communication between a client and a server is over persistent
&gt; &gt; connection to a single endpoint. If there's anything resembling
&gt; &gt; resources, they are not identified by URIs. The persistent connection
&gt; &gt; IMHO is a case of "conversational" state that REST is rather opposed to.
&gt; &gt; No HATEOAS in sight.
&gt;
&gt; sounds like websockets (maybe not technically, but as the general idea).
&gt; to me, REST is on a different level than this plumbing. in the same way
&gt; as you can do REST and notREST over HTTP, the same probably applies to
&gt; any of the alternative interaction styles. as you point out, REST has
&gt; more (and more abstract) constraints than just the protocol that's used.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What I'm pondering is whether an API can be RESTful and reactive at the
&gt; &gt; same time or if is impossible as a matter of principle. AFAICT, a
&gt; &gt; reactive API requires some way for the server to send events to the
&gt; &gt; client. I don't think polling qualifies, which leaves a persistent
&gt; &gt; connection. In effect, the server has to keep some amount of state for
&gt; &gt; each session.
&gt;
&gt; not sure i agree that polling or long polling are the only (or best)
&gt; alternatives. there's quite of stuff to be done in the area that i often
&gt; refer to as "reverse REST": clients subscribe, and then there's a push
&gt; model. there are a variety of push protocols (PuSH, MQTT, APN, C2DM,
&gt; sMAP) out there, but none so far has taken over the world.
&gt;
&gt; it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in june at the w3c's web
&gt; of things workshop. clearly, in sensor scenarios, it would be very
&gt; convenient to have these kind of alerts, have them in a loosely coupled
&gt; and scalable way, and have them via protocols that are universally
&gt; supported. it may be the case that w3c will start working on something
&gt; in that space, but we'll know more after that workshop.
&gt;
&gt; http://www.w3.org/2014/02/wot/
&gt;
&gt; http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil14a is a position paper that we
&gt; have submitted to this workshop. it may be the case that activity
&gt; streams take over as the new atom. we'll see about that, but they are
&gt; not all that different, and they use JSON, so all is good.
&gt;
&gt; and in the same way as you can layer PuSH on atom to have a push model
&gt; on top of atom's data model, you can do the same for activity streams.
&gt; that might be the way open push protocols are going: you can poll for
&gt; activities, or you can subscribe to an activity hub that pushes to you
&gt; whatever you has subscribed to.
&gt;
&gt; in my eyes, this could still be RESTful, only that of course you would
&gt; end up having more resources (such as subscriptions that need to be
&gt; managed and so on).
&gt;
&gt; anyway, a very good question, a very interesting field, and with the
&gt; whole IoT/WoT movement now getting a serious hype push, maybe we'll get
&gt; to something open, useful, and RESTful in the next couple of years.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Keeping session state has traditionally been regarded as a hindrance to
&gt; &gt; scalability. Has technology advanced so much, eg with asynchronous,
&gt; &gt; event-driven ("reactive") servers, that this is no longer a problem?
&gt;
&gt; just a question of cost. different protocols have different solutions
&gt; (PuSH subscriptions time out automatically, sMAP subscriptions never
&gt; time out), based on different scenarios. anything push-based is more
&gt; expensive than pure pull, because services/hubs need to keep track of
&gt; subscribers. but if the cost is smaller that the benefit, then this will
&gt; happen one way or another.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Frankly, I'm lacking experience with systems where this kind of
&gt; &gt; scalability would be required, so I'd happily use persistent
&gt; &gt; connections, at least to begin with. Nonetheless, I'm interested in your
&gt; &gt; insights.
&gt;
&gt; web of things scenarios simply cannot work with long polling. if you
&gt; want to be connected to thousands of sensors in your building to figure
&gt; out when one is telling you that there is a fire, then you cannot have
&gt; open connections to all of them. the answer here is a layered
&gt; architecture, maybe some of it hidden as implementation details (sensors
&gt; just speaking MQTT to a hub), and other things exposed on the web level
&gt; (you being able to subscribe to that hub and get alerts). many solutions
&gt; have been built around this general pattern, but so far we lack a single
&gt; and coherent answer where to draw the boundary between the
&gt; implementation details and the open part, and what we should use for
&gt; that open part. as mentioned above, maybe that workshop will bring
&gt; together enough interested parties to start working on that issue.
&gt;

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,


I've been scratching my head over this one for a while and am hoping I can
get some help.


Imagine a light switch with one simple resource: /state , where state can
be "On" or "Off."


One can PUT to /state , changing /state to either "On" or "Off."
Similarly, a GET to /state will tell you if the light is currently "On" or
"Off."


Where I'm struggling is with a safe "Toggle" mechanism.  That is, if
/state is "On", change it to "Off" and vice versa.


I understand that one solution would be to simply perform a GET on /state
and then PUT the opposite.  However, I am concerned with both the overhead
and latency this entails as well as the potential for a race condition
(what if /state changes between the GET and the PUT?).


Any solution I've looked at thus far seems to violate RESTful principles,
particularly regarding idempotency.  In short, can one safely toggle?


Any suggestions?


Thanks,
Robby

Mint a resource that represents the ‘on’ state (e.g. an on-flag)

PUT (create) and DELETE the flag using conditional requests:

Create-if-not-exists

PUT /toggles/42?on-flag
If-None-Match: *

delete if exists:
DELETE /toggles/42?on-flag
If-Match: *

<pre>it sounds like you want to implement "toggle" and i doubt "toggle" would
ever be idempotent since idempotent requests will contain the state that
you want to write ("on" or "off").

FWIW, you could use a non-idempotent write (HTTP.POST) to implement
"toggle" -- that would be consistent at the *network level* -- but i'm not
sure if that's what you need.

<pre>You could implement a POST operation that simply flips the state, whatever
it is.  If you implement PUT, the request should be idempotent but it's
unclear if that's what you intend here.  Protecting against the kind of
race conditions you mention is usually performed with conditional requests
(If-Match, If-None-Match, etc).

i am not sure this approach matches the original idea of toggling. by 
definition, toggling does not care about the prior state. if it did, you 
would instead simply switch to the opposite of the current state. if you 
have a toggle service, you must accept that you cannot predict the 
result *after* the toggle, because you do not know the state *before* 
the toggle. if you do, you're simply using "toggle" as a weird synonym 
that sometimes means "on" and sometimes means "off", and then maybe just 
using those terms would be a lot less confusing.

i don't think PUT is a good model for a toggle service, as there's no 
state to PUT. toggle inherently has race conditions, and if you don't 
like them, then maybe toggle is not a service you should provide. just 
provide the usual GET/PUT on the resource itself, and get rid of the 
toggle resource.

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful Toggle<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>All,


Thanks so much for the rapid replies!  A few comments / requests for clarifications:


Many have mentioned using conditional PUTs.  This will certainly solve the race conditions that I was worried about.  However, it will require some network chattiness (a GET to retrieve the current representation and ETag / Last-Modified, followed by a PUT with the appropriate header) which may require multiple round-trips should the state change between the GET and PUT.  Any thoughts on ways to avoid this chattiness and still maintain the RESTful principles?  In a perfect world, this could be accomplished with a single request, as the client does not really care what the current state is, the client merely wishes to toggle the state (e.g., a light switch that is simply a button).


-----


Others have mentioned the use of a POST.  To better understand the POST semantics, I've created an example below:


/switch     ---  (a GET will return the current state: "On" or "Off" ; a PUT will modify the current state: "On" or "Off)


I'm guessing that the POST would be to a resource such as /switch/toggle


However, I'm wondering if this violates RESTful principles and actually creates more of an RPC-like style.  Or perhaps I'm just overthinking..


It is unclear to me what the body of the POST to /switch/toggle would contain as well as what should happen if a GET or a PUT were performed.


Thanks,
Robby

You could implement a POST operation that simply flips the state, whatever it is.  If you implement PUT, the request should be idempotent but it's unclear if that's what you intend here.  Protecting against the kind of race conditions you mention is usually performed with conditional requests (If-Match, If-None-Match, etc).

<pre>Maybe I am missing something, but why not just be more semantically
explicit and if the state of the resources is "on", return a "off" link
relation with a POST method and if the state is "off" return an "on" link
relation with a POST method. You have a semantic understanding of what is
going on and could implement a toggle button in a UI that represented the
state, etc. Did I miss something in the definition of the problem?

<pre>Hi Dong,

Yes, in my application I'm actually more interested in a "blind" toggle like the pull handle of a slot machine.  (Perhaps that would be a better example going forward)

Regarding the POST, I'm still a bit confused as to how this would be constructed.  In my applications, I've tended to use the POST method on "collection" resources to create a new resource that is a member of the collection.  It seems to me if one had a resource /pullHandle and simply used POST with an empty body, that we are really heading down the RPC route rather than being RESTful.  This also overloads the semantics of POST ("POST as create a member" and "POST as ?activate?").  Am I just overthinking here?

Thanks,

Hi Erik,

I think when a use toggles, s/he must do that based on what s/he sees
or in fact saw. If it is a "blind" toggle then it is like the pull
handle of a slot machine. And I agree with you and Mike for a POST in
that case.

<pre>Robby, I'd like to know more about the real world need for such an API.
Sure, mechanical light switches DID work this way, but do home automation
systems really offer a "toggle"? I'm trying to imagine why I would ever
want to simply change the state of the lighting in my room, without caring
if the result was lights on or lights off. I can't.

So are you programming a home automation system? If so, do you really need
toggle, given my observation above?

Or is this just a hypothetical question about the generic behavior of
toggle and how it maps to REST? If so, then it kind of feels like the
perennial, "Can REST do THIS?" questions that skeptics of REST would lob
from time to time in the good old REST v WS-STAR WARS days. It kind of
reminds me of the old chestnut, "How can I do two-phase commit in REST?"

Or is your need for toggle behavior truly needed in some other actual
domain? If so, could you please tell us a bit more about the domain and
it's REAL need for toggle behavior. With such context in mind, we can
perhaps help you better map it into a RESTful API.

Thanks.

<pre>Hi Robby,

If there are only two states, I would name the resource /binary, and
each time it receive a POST with a 1 bit in the body and responds with
a current tail bit. Internally, it just adds the 1 bit to the atomic
binary. I think it is RESTful.

POST is not create, this is a common misconception (RFC 7231 now does a 
much better job at explaining POST than RFC 2616 did). it's REST's 
catch-all, so you can happily POST a "toggle" request to the resource

<pre>Hi Nick,

Happy to elaborate.

I'm certainly not heading down a hypothetical route, though I must admit I am interested in sticking close to a principled, clean design.

This particular issue has arisen in the design of home automation systems.  Specifically, I'm working in a standards body (the ZigBee Alliance) that has classically used a binary protocol that does not really adhere to any true architectural design (IMHO).  I've been engaged in work that started in ZigBee and has now moved to IEEE (2030.5) that (attempts to) rigidly stick to a RESTful HTTP design.  One request that has come up is to port toggle switch capability to this standard.  Home automation manufacturers have actually implemented toggle switches this way in the past (see http://zigbee.org/Products/ByStandard/ZigBeeHomeAutomation.aspx).

So, in short, I myself am not manufacturing a specific toggle switch, but rather have been working in a standards body where others have requested the inclusion of toggle switch functionality.  We also have some use cases for a simple button press, which I see as a similar problem.

Thanks,
Robby

i don't think it matters anymore given that it seems a "blind toggle" is 
what is needed.

but if a "non-blind toggle" is needed, i think it simply would be 
confusing to even call it "toggle". in that case, you know the current 
state and want to switch to the other state, so why not just do that 
with the usual GET/PUT pattern?

Specifically, I'm working in a standards body (the ZigBee Alliance) that has classically used a binary protocol that does not really adhere to any true architectural design (IMHO).  I've been engaged in work that started in ZigBee and has now moved to IEEE (2030.5) that (attempts to) rigidly stick to a RESTful HTTP design.  One request that has come up is to port toggle switch capability to this standard.  Home automation manufacturers have actually implemented toggle switches this way in the past (see http://zigbee.org/Products/ByStandard/ZigBeeHomeAutomation.aspx).
&gt; 
&gt; So, in short, I myself am not manufacturing a specific toggle switch, but rather have been working in a standards body where others have requested the inclusion of toggle switch functionality.  We also have some use cases for a simple button press, which I see as a similar problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Robby, I'd like to know more about the real world need for such an API. Sure, mechanical light switches DID work this way, but do home automation systems really offer a "toggle"? I'm trying to imagine why I would ever want to simply change the state of the lighting in my room, without caring if the result was lights on or lights off. I can't.
&gt; 
&gt; So are you programming a home automation system? If so, do you really need toggle, given my observation above?
&gt; 
&gt; Or is this just a hypothetical question about the generic behavior of toggle and how it maps to REST? If so, then it kind of feels like the perennial, "Can REST do THIS?" questions that skeptics of REST would lob from time to time in the good old REST v WS-STAR WARS days. It kind of reminds me of the old chestnut, "How can I do two-phase commit in REST?"
&gt; 
&gt; Or is your need for toggle behavior truly needed in some other actual domain? If so, could you please tell us a bit more about the domain and it's REAL need for toggle behavior. With such context in mind, we can perhaps help you better map it into a RESTful API.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been scratching my head over this one for a while and am hoping I can
&gt; get some help.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine a light switch with one simple resource: /state , where state can
&gt; be "On" or "Off."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One can PUT to /state , changing /state to either "On" or "Off."
&gt; Similarly, a GET to /state will tell you if the light is currently "On" or
&gt; "Off."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Where I'm struggling is with a safe "Toggle" mechanism.  That is, if
&gt; /state is "On", change it to "Off" and vice versa.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that one solution would be to simply perform a GET on /state
&gt; and then PUT the opposite.  However, I am concerned with both the overhead
&gt; and latency this entails as well as the potential for a race condition
&gt; (what if /state changes between the GET and the PUT?).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any solution I've looked at thus far seems to violate RESTful principles,
&gt; particularly regarding idempotency.  In short, can one safely toggle?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Robby

it sounds like the scenario we were talking about, that all you want is 
to tell the resource to "reverse its state". in this case, i'd POST a 
body that represents this request, in whatever serialization you happen 
to prefer. the resource toggles. everybody's happy.

but i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned 
about race conditions. which seems to imply that instead of just 
toggling, you're also assuming that you're "toggling *from* some state". 
but that wouldn't be the "blind toggle" we discussed. could you clarify 
a bit how exactly the operation that you're trying to design is defined?

cheers,

OK.  Still seems like a bit of a departure from typical RESTful interfaces
I've seen and has the potential to be a catch-all tunnel for RPC-style
requests.

E.g.:
/command, where one could POST all sorts of commands like "toggle."

&gt;but i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned

Apologies, a blind toggle is what is desired.  As it currently works, in

sends a "toggle" command.

wouldn't need to POST to /command, rather, you would POST to
/togglablethingy with a body of, for example, "toggle=true".

&gt; Apologies, a blind toggle is what is desired.  As it currently works, in

then how would a race condition enter the picture? just because of the 
timestamp when you last observed the resource's state? or something 
else? to me, toggling always is kind of a game: if somebody toggled 
ahead of you, you'll do something other than you wanted to, but that's 
how it is and you'll have to deal with it after toggling and finding out 
that you switched the damn thing back on again...

It doesn't.  Apologies for being confusing - I was thinking about the race
condition if I were limited to a GET followed by a PUT.  However, the POST
mechanism solves this by being atomic.

Thanks again,

Message:<br><br>
<pre>From home automation point of view, I can only think of one use case where
"toggle" actually has any validity, and that would be in the "3 way switch"
scenario.

A 3 way switch is exemplified by walking up to a dark hallway, turning the
light on with a nearby swtich, walking to the end, and then turning the
light off with a switch at the other end.

This use case is a true "toggle", since the "state" is the actual light (on
or off), and the switch itself does not represent that state (unlike a
normal, single switch). The switches can be "up" or "down" unrelated to the
light being "on" or "off".

Given that, again from a home automation point of view, I can't really ever
see "toggle" as a viable action. Maybe it's a primitive. But, in the end,
when you walk in to that dark hallway, what you want is the light to go on,
the mechanics of the switches are secondary.

I just mention this because at a high level, "toggle" doesn't make much
sense to me. The automation folks may well need it as a primitive to
control a switch. But at the "application" level, it doesn't make much
sense. At an application level, you either want the "Light" ON or OFF.

So, with that consideration, a simple POST will do the trick.

I don't think there's any "race condition", because "toggle" is not a
state, it's an action. If you care about the state, then set the state you
want. You should hide the "toggle", and enforce the state behind the scenes
(where you can manage race conditions on the server). Let the server decide
that when you change the state to ON, it can determine, internally, if the
device is OFF and then send a TOGGLE command to make it ON. If it's already
ON, then nothing happens.

But a "toggle" POST is just that, a simple command.

Will Hartung

<pre>From a design perspective, I prefer a conditional PUT as well.

Unfortunately, latency is a major issue with wireless lighting (i.e., users do not want to notice any delay) and there is a perception that having to have a GET before a PUT would introduce too much latency.  Especially in scenarios where there are multiple lights (multicast).

&gt; E.g.:
&gt; /command, where one could POST all sorts of commands like "toggle."

the problem is not that POST can mean anything (it can), but people
POSTing things to a "do stuff" resource, which then isn't
resource-oriented anymore. your RPC sensor shouldn't go off because of
people POSTing things to resources (that's fine), but because of people
POSTing things to something other than resources (the "API end point",
for example).


&gt;&gt; but i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned

&gt;&gt; toggling, you're also assuming that you're "toggling *from* some state".
&gt;&gt; but that wouldn't be the "blind toggle" we discussed. could you clarify
&gt;&gt; a bit how exactly the operation that you're trying to design is defined?
&gt; Apologies, a blind toggle is what is desired. As it currently works, in
&gt; the current binary protocol, a button press on a toggle switch simply
&gt; sends a "toggle" command.

then how would a race condition enter the picture? just because of the
timestamp when you last observed the resource's state? or something
else? to me, toggling always is kind of a game: if somebody toggled
ahead of you, you'll do something other than you wanted to, but that's
how it is and you'll have to deal with it after toggling and finding out
that you switched the damn thing back on again...

about the atompub protocol. By protocol you should post things to the feed.
If we are actually idempotent and everything is a create (say a collection

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful Toggle<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>A conditional PUT is focusing on the mechanic, not the result.

A PUT /light "ON" is idempotent. When it's done, the light is turned on,
whether it was on or not.

From a user perspective, they want the light "ON", how that is achieved
they simply don't care about.

The conditional PUT is "toggle the switch unless it's already toggled",
which is pretty silly. It's silly because that level of coordination simply
should not be exposed. It's also silly because it can be simply emulated by
fetching the state and PUTing to the the Other State (or an other state).

There are certainly scenarios for optimistic locking, I just don't really
think this is one of them.

As far as the latency issue, again, you're talking about primitives. If you
need to control a bank of lights, create a representation at the
appropriate granularity. Something like, I dunno, "room". PUT
/lights/room/living ON.

In the end, the system should control the light directly, and should have
access to the state of the lights. The "switches" (whether on the wall or
an iPhone) should be inputs to the system, which then interprets those
inputs and reacts with lights turning on and off. The switch does not turn
the light on, it asks the system to turn the light on, and the system will
do so if it deems it appropriate based on its internal rules.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense to me. The automation folks may well need it as a primitive to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control a switch. But at the "application" level, it doesn't make much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense. At an application level, you either want the "Light" ON or OFF.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, with that consideration, a simple POST will do the trick.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think there's any "race condition", because "toggle" is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state, it's an action. If you care about the state, then set the state you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want. You should hide the "toggle", and enforce the state behind the scenes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (where you can manage race conditions on the server). Let the server decide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that when you change the state to ON, it can determine, internally, if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; device is OFF and then send a TOGGLE command to make it ON. If it's already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ON, then nothing happens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But a "toggle" POST is just that, a simple command.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it sounds like the scenario we were talking about, that all you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to tell the resource to "reverse its state". in this case, i'd POST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; body that represents this request, in whatever serialization you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to prefer. the resource toggles. everybody's happy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; OK. Still seems like a bit of a departure from typical RESTful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interfaces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen and has the potential to be a catch-all tunnel for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RPC-style
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; requests.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; E.g.:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; /command, where one could POST all sorts of commands like "toggle."
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the problem is not that POST can mean anything (it can), but people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSTing things to a "do stuff" resource, which then isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resource-oriented anymore. your RPC sensor shouldn't go off because of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people POSTing things to resources (that's fine), but because of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POSTing things to something other than resources (the "API end point",
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for example).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about race conditions. which seems to imply that instead of just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; toggling, you're also assuming that you're "toggling *from* some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but that wouldn't be the "blind toggle" we discussed. could you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clarify
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a bit how exactly the operation that you're trying to design is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defined?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Apologies, a blind toggle is what is desired. As it currently works,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the current binary protocol, a button press on a toggle switch simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sends a "toggle" command.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then how would a race condition enter the picture? just because of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timestamp when you last observed the resource's state? or something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else? to me, toggling always is kind of a game: if somebody toggled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ahead of you, you'll do something other than you wanted to, but that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how it is and you'll have to deal with it after toggling and finding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you switched the damn thing back on again...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Solution:

PUT /state/toggle
DELETE /state


Returns semantics for redirected or moved resources. Override with new

Is it RESTful? Thats a question we see a lot of times ... "Is this POST to
/xyz RESTful" or "Is this a RESTful URL" or "Is it RESTful to DELETE
this?". Thats not easily answered and its very much like taking a brick, a
flooring tile or a piece of wall paint from a specific church building and
ask "Is this brick/tile/paint Grotesque?". But a brick in itself doesn't
necessarily adhere to any specific architectural style - it can be used in
many different styles. And the same goes for a URL/HTTP VERB/media-type
what ever - you cannot say in isolation whether it is RESTful or not - it
depends on how the overall building/system is built/implemented.

If I started with an override for the new OPTION:QUEUE and demonstrate it,
I know, some people will consider it incomplete. If stateless means someone
else finishes it and gets credit for it, the toggle is bad or not ReSTful.


We have an ugly toggle, and that is the existentialism of /#.


POST /#/start
POST /#/stop
DELETE /#

 Question how do I remove a DOC and CONTAINER association?
 

 DELETE /alpha/:id/doc/:id  - this really doesn't feel right.

<pre>I think an extra resource will help like

POST /associations with /alpha/:id and /doc/:id to create /association/:id
PUT /associations/:id to update the association
and
DELETE /associations/:id to remove the association

Subject:Resource that can be written to once<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi everyone,
 

 Let's say I have a resource /foo that can be written to once. 
 How should the server respond to a second attempt?
 Basically at this point the method is no longer allowed but it seems odd to change the allowed methods at runtime. 
 Should I maybe tell the client to GET the /foo resource? 
 

 Looking forward to your insights!
 

 Cheers,

Subject:Custom link relations<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi everyone,
 

 Yesterday I was researching custom link relations.
 I've skimmed through rfc5988 and understood that custom link relations should be fully qualified URLs as well?
 So far I've applied a namespace prefix (e.g. Link: &lt;/users&gt;; rel=my-namespace:users; type=application/json).
 What's are the arguments against using a namespace prefix?
 What are the arguments in favour of using a fully qualified URL?
 So far it seems a bit odd to me to use a fully qualified URL because the link relationship value will than often coincide with the actual URL of the resource...
 

 Thanks for your help.
 

 Cheers,
 

 Marijn

it's not allowed.

it's allowed.

there's little point to argue about what the spec allows. it is what it 
is. we could have a chat why it has been created that way, but that's 
purely academic.

&gt; So far it seems a bit odd to me to use a fully qualified URL because the
&gt; link relationship value will than often coincide with the actual URL of
&gt; the resource...

that would not be a good sign for your API. when using link relations, 
keep the following in mind:

- reuse existing link relations when possible, so that developers can 
reuse their understanding of them in the context of your API.

- link relations should not identify *what* you're linking to. that's 
one of the most common mistakes in REST design. they should identify 
*why* you might want to follow a certain link in its given context.

following these two recommendations, your link relations should change 
quite a bit, and you'll see that there is a big difference in the 
hypermedia design itself (which establishes the "context model" through 
which clients navigate), and the resources in one instance of that 
design (which are the concrete resources that a client is navigating).

cheers,

dret.

<pre>Hi Marijn,


'409 Conflict' may be an option but its document says "This code is used in
situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and
resubmit the request." [1] which is not true in your case. So "405 Method
Not Allowed" might be the best option. Why do you think it is odd to change
the allowed methods on runtime?  IMHO, when state of the resource changes,
its interaction could change as well. It is it is even expected, for
example, the responses to the OPTIONS method is not cacheable.

document.  The XML patch document format builds on the foundations
defined in RFC 5261.  This specification also provides the media type
registration "application/xml-patch+xml", to allow the use of XML
patch documents in, for example, HTTP conversations.

Subject:Forward/Backward versioning, media-types, etc<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,

I've been reading up quite a bit on versioning, HATEOAS, forward/backward compatibility changes and versioning, etc with REST APIs. Some recent docs are suggesting that more people are using versioning in the URI but only for major version changes of the entire API and update the version very rarely. I fall into the camp that the resource URI should not be versioned, instead using the Accept header and version the media-type (conneg). 

I do have a couple of questions though around all this.

From some stuff I've read, it sounded like if I have a version 1 XML document, with say &lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that was public, and then I wanted to add a new element to that doc (representation) (e.g. &lt;a&gt;&lt;b/&gt;&lt;c/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;c/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), existing clients should not break because they would simply ignore the newly added element. However, I am seeing something somewhat different, in that we support JSON and XML, and in some cases, we're seeing exceptions when the new document is trying to be marshaled into a POJO object. I should say that we provide an XSD document that is used by our server side as well as clients to generate POJOs. We do so with Python and Java presently, but I assume any language could take our XSD and generate POJOs, then use those when marshaling/un-marshaling representations. So it seems, at least with XML, there may be a way (I don't know off hand) to "relax" the requirement for newly added elements to match the generated POJO
 objects, such that a client with our first version could actually receive the 2nd version document, but would only see the elements that their first version POJO understood during the marshaling process. Hope that makes sense. Anyway, I am confused if this is how it should be, with both XML and JSON, or if the exception we're seeing means that our clients MUST indicate version 2 of the representation?

I think the right answer is that ALL of our resources should always require the Accept header to include the version of the document, and from day one, it should be v1, so that when v2 comes out, existing clients are still using v1 (and we return v1 to them), but those clients that know about v2, can update their clients to request the v2 representation. At least from all that I've read, this seems safer than assuming a client using our XSDs to generate POJOs to use in their language, will get a properly marshaled v2 representation within a v1 POJO.

Along similar lines.. when we add new items to an existing doc, then it's correct to bump the version value to get the new representation.. right? That is, we're currently working through a beta program and we're taking customer feedback to adjust/add/fix/remove/etc various API resource representations. During this cycle, some of our customers are still using version 1, some moved to version 2, and we're working on version 3 now. Is it "ok" to keep bumping the version in this case? At some point we'll release a GA and whatever version that is, stays in GA. However, our goal is to move to a more rapid release schedule, such that we may be adding features (new resources) along with updating (extending/adding to) existing resources (their representations). As we do this, I assume we should be bumping the versions of the specific resource representations that change (be it add, change or remove elements from the representation).. does that make sense?</pre><br><br><br><br><br>

Subject:Re: [rest-discuss] Forward/Backward versioning, media-types, etc<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Kevin:

Your post covers a topic that comes up quite often in my discussion w/ devs
(both server- and client-side). My answer to the questions about how to
handle "change over time" may not be quite what you are looking for. But I
decided to pass it along anyway as it has helped me quite a bit over the
last several years in dealing with the problem.

TL;DNR
- Always make your service changes backward-compatible
- Services should promise to never take anything away, never change
processing of inputs, and always make new elements optional
- Services should only promise to return message formats (like HTML, HAL,
etc.) using pre-defined terms (e.g. "givenName", "familyName") and not
promise any functions to execute or objects in return
- Client apps should not use schema to constrain incoming messages, should
code defensively, and be designed to inspect incoming message for desired
terms, not designed to deserialize objects or execute remote functions.
- Essentially, both client and server should abide by Postel's Law

Doing this reduces the need to use "versioning" to separate one service
instance from another and can make services useful to client apps for quite
a long time w/o the need to "fork" the service and clients.

Hopefully this gives you some ideas on how to deal with changes in APIs.

Cheers.

Here's the long version.

BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE
First, I start from the POV that all changes will be backward-compatible.
IOW, no change in the future will invalidate the past. This is how both
HTTP and HTML have been working over the last couple decades. HTTP 1.0, 1.1
and lots of changes in between (PATCH, LINK methods, new headers, etc.) are
implemented in a way that doesn't break existing implementations.

THREE PROMISES
Next, any assurances/promises my service makes to clients is based on this
First Principle of "no breaking changes." That means it is important for me
to be clear about what I promise going forward. My promise will shape what
the client expects as non-breaking.  And here are my promises to client
apps that implement my service API
1 - i will never "take anything away" So, any URL I promise will either a)
still exists or b) be redirected. Any parameters I describe for URL queries
or request bodies will always be accepted. Any parameters described in a
response body will always be there.
2 - I will never change the processing/meaning of parameters. So, if i
promise the parameter "count" represents the number of users in a list, I
will not change this at some future point such that "count" represents the
number of pages in a collection, etc.
3 - Any new elements I introduce will be optional. I will not create new
*required* parameters for previously promised requests. If i need to create
new requirements, I will create a new promise and that promise will be
optional for any existing implementations.

PROMISE MESSAGES AND TERMS NOT FUNCTIONS AND OBJECTS
Next, my service almost never promise to return an object like a "user" or
"customer", etc. Instead, my service promises to return a message in one or
more formats -- message formats like HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, Siren,
etc. Each of these formats have their own rules about what is legal, what
is required, etc. and my service will always honor those promises (from the
format designers).

My service publishes a list of valid vocabulary terms that can be returned
within messages. Terms like "givenName", "familyName", etc. The vocabulary
also includes action terms such as "update", "create", "share", "move",
"copy" or whatever other terms make sense for this service space. Client
applications need to be able to recognize and process these terms when the
appear.

This means client apps need to focus on the message and the terms, not some
idea of object or function when requesting, accepting, and parsing
responses. I make no promise that URL X will return object Y. Client apps
take on the task of parsing the message and then looking at that message to
find the terms (and their associated values) and be prepared to deal with
them when the appear in a response.

NON-BREAKING CHANGES BASED ON THESE PROMISES
Because my service makes promises based on message formats and vocabulary
terms, there are a series of changes that my service can make and claim as
non-breaking:
- a new optional parameter can now be used to filter requests (e.g.
&amp;sort=familyName is now available for an existing search operation)
- a new operation exists that returns a summary of existing data (e.g. a
new URL w/ new arguments is published)
- one or more response terms have been moved in the message (e.g. givenName
is now at the end of the message instead of the top).

Client apps are expected to continue to function under the above
circumstances. That means client apps need to refrain from memorizing the
"shape" of responses or assuming certain values or terms will ALWAYS appear
in responses in the EXACT SAME PLACE as they did in the past. That means
strong schema-checking for inbound messages doesn't help -- actually hurts
-- client apps. It also means client apps need to safely ignore things they
don't recognize in responses. Ultimately, this means client apps are coded
"defensively" and must be implemented in a way that accounts for minor
changes like those listed here.

POSTEL'S LAW, RULE OF ROBUSTNESS
This is the embodiment of Postel's Law: "Be conservative in what you send,
be liberal in what you accept." HTML browsers work this way today. I don't
see examples of these kinds of client apps being talked about much in the
public space. Most of the time web API clients are implemented as scripted,
static consumers of strongly-typed response objects guaranteed against
pre-defined URLs. When that happens, even the smallest change in a request
or response body and cause the client app fail.

&gt;
&gt;  Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I've been reading up quite a bit on versioning, HATEOAS, forward/backward
&gt; compatibility changes and versioning, etc with REST APIs. Some recent docs
&gt; are suggesting that more people are using versioning in the URI but only
&gt; for major version changes of the entire API and update the version very
&gt; rarely. I fall into the camp that the resource URI should not be versioned,
&gt; instead using the Accept header and version the media-type (conneg).
&gt;
&gt; I do have a couple of questions though around all this.
&gt;
&gt; From some stuff I've read, it sounded like if I have a version 1 XML
&gt; document, with say &lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that was public, and then I
&gt; wanted to add a new element to that doc (representation) (e.g.
&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;b/&gt;&lt;c/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;c/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), existing clients should not break
&gt; because they would simply ignore the newly added element. However, I am
&gt; seeing something somewhat different, in that we support JSON and XML, and
&gt; in some cases, we're seeing exceptions when the new document is trying to
&gt; be marshaled into a POJO object. I should say that we provide an XSD
&gt; document that is used by our server side as well as clients to generate

Abstract:
   This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple
   descriptions of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to
   HTML microformats.  An ALPS document can be used as a profile to
   explain the application semantics of a document with an application-
   agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, Siren,
   etc.).  This increases the reusability of profile documents across
   media types.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.  Comments should be sent
   to the IETF Media-Types mailing list (see [1]).




Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Subject:Resource Representation dilemma<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi,

 I got a problem on understand the way I should represent resources. I'm bulding a REST api for learning purpose and in that, if there is a array of data, I could just convert it to JSON when requested. 
ex: in php, 
$json = json_encode($array);

If I send this to the requester as the response, they would be able to perform the opposite "json_decode" and get the exact same $array. If the array is a result of well known function, the reciever would be able to use existing app or methods to consume it as the format is already known. 

But, what would be the better way? Should I come up with my own representation of the data where I would be able to add more information such as "link rel" or use the previous method. What is the best practise while implementing REST API? 

Thank you,

Kalana

It was asked off-list:

2) Why am I interested in "real REST"?  It's a big topic.
3) Why did I think the calculator would be good?

I mostly want to cover Python+Flask in a REST context.  The main focus
is Flask, but it seems Flask is most useful in a REST context; for Web
GUI's, one would probably use Django or something instead.

I'm interested in "real REST", because I've heard repeatedly that
"real REST" isn't just RPC, and I'd like to use a decent example.
What specific area of REST isn't really that important to me.

I thought the calculator might be good, because you could design a few
URL's that play nicely with a web cache.  I have gotten the impression
that this was one measure of RESTfulness.

In terms of books with good examples, I'm a big fan of:
"RESTful Web APIs" by Leonard Richardson, Mike Amundsen, and Sam Ruby (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028468.do)

REST is a rather big topic.
It is difficult to tell what you should present about unless you explain some of your goals or the the interest of the audience.


Why are you interested in â€œreal RESTâ€?
Why did you think the calculator program would be a good example?

 What? a full-day workshop on current and future challenges for Web APIs and their interaction
 Why? Web APIs are more important than ever, yet many unsolved problems demand our attention
 When? full-day workshop on May 18, 2015 â€“ paper submissions before January 24, 2015
 Where? at the WWW2015 conference in Florence, Italy
 

 Thousands of APIs exist and their number is growing tremendously, while use cases become increasingly complex. In contrast to the human-oriented part of the Web, Web APIs are designed to be used by machines. This makes issues surrounding their design and integration significantly different from those of the traditional Web. However, this also enables the provisioning of new added-value automated solutions on the Web.
 

 This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners by providing an open discussion forum around the design and use of the programmable Web. It is the principal venue for discussing latests findings and research and development results around the issues, practices, and best principles surrounding Web API design and use.
 

 Pressing Topics
 We especially welcome research and engineering work in the following areas:
 â€¢ development of intelligent and generic Web API clients
 â€¢ dynamic combination of and interactions between Web APIs
 â€¢ novel hypermedia-driven solutions
 â€¢ tackling the tremendous growth and heterogeneity of APIs
 â€¢ analysis and understanding of the social and economic factors surrounding the development, use, and adoption of Web APIs and mashups
 â€¢ novel solutions for the automated discovery and profiling of Web APIs
 â€¢ novel technologies for facilitating the development of mashups and services for the Web of Things
 â€¢ lessons learned from the deployment, maintenance and evolution of Web APIs and mashups
 

 All Topics
 In addition to the topics above, this workshop is also open to:
 â€¢ applications of the REST architectural style to novel domains
 â€¢ design patterns and anti-patterns for Web APIs
 â€¢ automated Web API composition
 â€¢ inverted REST (REST for push events)
 â€¢ integration of pub/sub with REST
 â€¢ REST-compliant transaction models
 â€¢ frameworks for Web API implementation and consumption
 â€¢ modeling Web APIs
 â€¢ resource design and granularity
 â€¢ evolution, versioning, and extension of Web APIs
 â€¢ REST-protocols beyond HTTP
